       "  'AB': 'Studies in mice using germfree animals as controls for microbial colonization have shown that the gut microbiome mediates diet-induced obesity. Such studies use diets rich in saturated fat, however, Western diets in the USA are enriched in soybean oil, composed of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), either linoleic or oleic acid. Here, we addressed whether the microbiome is a variable in fat metabolism in mice on a soybean oil diet. We used conventionally-raised, low-germ, and germfree mice fed for 10 weeks diets either high (HF) or low (LF) in high-linoleic-acid soybean oil as the sole source of fat. Conventional and germfree gained relative fat weight and all mice consumed more calories on the HF versus LF soybean oil diet. Plasma fatty acid levels were generally dependent on diet, with microbial colonization status affecting iso-C18:0, C20:3n-6, C14:0, and C15:0 levels. Colonization status, but not diet, impacted levels of liver sphingolipids including ceramides, sphingomyelins, and sphinganine. Our results confirm that absorbed fatty acids are mainly a reflection of the diet and that microbial colonization influences liver sphingolipid pools regardless of diet.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) produced by the commensal microbiota and host cells activates purinergic signaling, promoting intestinal inflammation and pathology. Based on the role of eATP in intestinal inflammation, we developed yeast-based engineered probiotics that express a human P2Y2 purinergic receptor with up to a 1,000-fold increase in eATP sensitivity. We linked the activation of this engineered P2Y2 receptor to the secretion of the ATP-degrading enzyme apyrase, thus creating engineered yeast probiotics capable of sensing a pro-inflammatory molecule and generating a proportional self-regulated response aimed at its neutralization. These self-tunable yeast probiotics suppressed intestinal inflammation in mouse models of IBD, reducing intestinal fibrosis and dysbiosis with an efficacy similar to or higher than that of standard-of-care therapies usually associated with notable adverse events. By combining directed evolution and synthetic gene circuits, we developed a unique self-modulatory platform for the treatment of IBD and potentially other inflammation-driven pathologies.',\n",

We compared the effects of paper andcorncob bedding on weight gain, metabolism, and gut microbiome (GM) of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a normal diet(ND) and evaluated effects on fecal and cecal microbiomes collected from these cohorts after euthanasia. Male C57BL/6J mice at 5 wk age were allowed to acclimate to the facility and the assigned bedding for one week before being placed on HFD or remaining on the ND for 12 wk. Fecal pellets and cecal samples were collected and frozen for batched 16S sequencing. Mice had similar body weight, visceral gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT), subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (IWAT), liver and spleen weights and metabolic changes regardless of the bedding type. Baseline microbiota differences were detected one week after bedding assignment. After 12 wk, the GM showed significant differences depending on both bedding and diet. The effects of the bedding were not significantly different between endpoint fecal and cecal GM, despite the inherent differences in microbiota in fecal and cecal samples. A correlation was detected between diet and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia:Akkermansia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of considering bedding type when performing dietary experiments.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND: Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice are commonly used mice models mimicking the conditions of obesity and type 2 diabetes development. However, although ob/ob and db/db mice are similarly gaining weight and developing massive obesity, db/db mice are more diabetic than ob/ob mice. It remains still unclear why targeting the same pathway-leptin signaling-leads to the development of two different phenotypes. Given that gut microbes dialogue with the host via different metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) but also contribute to the regulation of bile acids metabolism, we investigated whether inflammatory markers, bacterial components, bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, and gut microbes could contribute to explain the specific phenotype discriminating the onset of an obese and/or a diabetic state in ob/ob and db/db mice. RESULTS: Six-week-old ob/ob and db/db mice were followed for 7 weeks; they had comparable body weight, fat mass, and lean mass gain, confirming their severely obese status. However, as expected, the glucose metabolism and the glucose-induced insulin secretion were significantly different between ob/ob and db/db mice. Strikingly, the fat distribution was different, with db/db mice having more subcutaneous and ob/ob mice having more epididymal fat. In addition, liver steatosis was more pronounced in the ob/ob mice than in db/db mice. We also found very distinct inflammatory profiles between ob/ob and db/db mice, with a more pronounced inflammatory tone in the liver for ob/ob mice as compared to a higher inflammatory tone in the (subcutaneous) adipose tissue for db/db mice. When analyzing the gut microbiota composition, we found that the quantity of 19 microbial taxa was in some way affected by the genotype. Furthermore, we also show that serum LPS concentration, hepatic bile acid content, and cecal short-chain fatty acid profiles were differently affected by the two genotypes. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results elucidate potential mechanisms implicated in the development of an obese or a diabetic state in two genetic models characterized by an altered leptin signaling. We propose that these differences could be linked to specific inflammatory tones, serum LPS concentration, bile acid metabolism, short-chain fatty acid profile, and gut microbiota composition.

However, the complex modulating effects of calcium intake on obese mice have not been clarified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of calcium intake on body weight/visceral fat mass were examined in the obese mouse model, KK-A(y) Results: Body weight gain decreased in mice fed a diet containing 0.4 to 3.2% calcium at the age of 11 and 13 weeks, but not at 12 weeks after normalization for food intake. Calcium intake also decreased serum insulin levels and increased the amount of feces excreted. Fecal deoxycholate levels were lower in the high-calcium group than in the normal diet control group. Furthermore, the ratio of the deoxycholate-producing microbiome in feces decreased. CONCLUSION: Dietary calcium has anti-obesity effects in obese KK-A(y) mice. Inhibition of insulin production and an increased amount of feces excreted with calcium intake may affect body weight.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'Obesity has become a major public health problem in recent decades. More effective interventions may result from a better understanding of microbiota alterations caused by weight loss and diet. Our objectives were (a) to calculate the fiber composition of a specially designed low-calorie weight loss diet (WLD), and (b) to evaluate changes in the composition of gut microbiota and improvements in health characteristics during WLD. A total of 19 overweight/obese participants were assigned to 20%-40% reduced calories low-carbohydrate high-fat diet for four weeks. Protein and fat content in the composed diet was 1.5 times higher compared to that in the average diet of the normal weight reference group, while carbohydrate content was 2 times lower. Food consumption data were obtained from the assigned meals. Microbial composition was analyzed before and after WLD intervention from two sequential samples by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. During WLD, body mass index (BMI) was reduced on average 2.5 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2) and stool frequency was normalized. The assigned diet induced significant changes in fecal microbiota. The abundance of bile-resistant bacteria (Alistipes, Odoribacter splanchnicus), Ruminococcus bicirculans, Butyricimonas, and Enterobacteriaceae increased. Importantly, abundance of bacteria often associated with inflammation such as Collinsella and Dorea decreased in parallel with a decrease in BMI. Also, we observed a reduction in bifidobacteria, which can be attributed to the relatively low consumption of grains. In conclusion, weight loss results in significant alteration of the microbial community structure.',\n",

Today gut microbiota composition and its derived metabolites modification are known as one of the recent therapeutic strategies. Studies show that Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut microbiota-derived metabolite that may be involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic disease and atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia, and heart failure. Due to existing some disagreements in this manner, future studies are needed to obtain a definitive sight of the association between this metabolite and CVDs. TMAO may be beneficial as a prognostic marker, which represents the degree of gut microbiota dysbiosis and subsequently CVD events and also different therapies methods based on TMAO and its metabolic pathways can be the target of clinical trial on cardiovascular disease and/or its prevention.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'SARS-CoV-2, primarily considered a respiratory virus, is increasingly recognized as having gastrointestinal aspects based on its presence in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and feces. SARS-CoV-2 uses as a receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a critical member of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid system. In addition to the systemic endocrine functions, RAAS components are also involved in intracrine and organ-specific local functions. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is a key component of RAAS and a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. It is expressed in many tissues with gastrointestinal (GI) tract ACE-2 levels far exceeding those in the respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 binding to its receptor results in a deficiency of ACE-2 activity in endocrine, intracrine, and local lung and GI tract ACE-2. The local ACE-2 has different organ-specific functions, including hypertension-independent activities; dysregulations of these functions may contribute to multiorgan COVID-19 pathology, its severity, long-term effects, and mortality. We review supporting evidence from this standpoint. Notably, COVID-19 comorbidities involving hypertension, obesity, heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes are associated with gastrointestinal problems and display ACE-2 deficits. While RAAS inhibitors target both endocrine and intracrine ACE-2 activity, the deficit of the local ACE-2 activity in the lungs and more so in the gut have not been targeted. Consequently, the therapeutic approach to COVID-19 should be carefully reconsidered. Ongoing clinical trials testing oral probiotic bound ACE-2 delivery are promising.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are associated with changes in the gut bacterial composition, but little is known about the role of the viral community (virome) in disease development. This study aims to characterize the gut virome alterations in obese subjects with or without T2DM. METHODS: 128 obese subjects (Body Mass Index (BMI) >/=28Kg/m(2)) and 101 lean controls (BMI >/= 18.5 and < 23 Kg/m(2)) were recruited from two regions in China (Hong Kong: HK; Kunming: KM). Fecal virome and bacteriome were profiled by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Gut virome, bacteriome and viral-bacterial correlations were compared between obese subjects and lean controls. RESULTS: Obese subjects especially those with T2DM (ObT2) had a decreased gut viral richness and diversity compared with lean controls in the HK cohort (p < .05), while no significant differences were observed in the KM cohort. Eleven viruses, including Escherichia phage, Geobacillus phage and Lactobacillus phage were enriched in obese subjects (q < .1). Besides, seventeen differentially abundant viruses were identified between ObT2 and lean controls (q < .1). Further ecological analysis revealed that intensive trans-kingdom correlations between viruses and bacteria observed in lean controls were significantly decreased in ObT2 subjects (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is characterized by altered viral taxonomic composition and weakened viral-bacterial correlations compared with lean controls. Accompanied with T2DM may aggravate the obesity-associated virus signatures, signifying that gut virome may play an important role in the development of obesity and T2DM. Geographic factors also contributed to the variations of gut virome in obesity and T2DM.',\n",

       "  'AB': 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The objective of this review is to assess the most recent literature on pubertal trends in boys and girls as well as evaluate genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors implicated in the timing of pubertal progression. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies confirm the previously described link between increased adiposity and earlier onset of puberty in girls, and more recent studies shed light onto the previously unclear situation in boys as a preponderance of recent longitudinal studies suggests that increased adiposity is linked with earlier pubertal timing also in boys. Discoveries of novel pathways highlights the complexity of pubertal development and suggest mechanistic links between nutrition, obesity, leptin, insulin resistance, and puberty. Furthermore, genetic and epigenetic variants can be linked to early puberty. Other factors, such as prenatal and postnatal environment, gut microbiota, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals have also been linked to both obesity and earlier puberty. SUMMARY: Understanding how the interactions of these factors contribute the relationship between obesity and early pubertal onset is crucial as early puberty has been linked with long-term consequences, such as short stature, earlier type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and poor psychological and behavioral outcomes.',\n",
