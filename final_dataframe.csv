Efflux pumps can lead to reduced susceptibility to a variety of antibiotics and are present in large number across Acinetobacter spp. There are six families of efflux pumps that have been shown to be of clinical relevance: the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), Small Multidrug Resistance (SMR) family, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, Multidrug and Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) family, Proteobacterial Antimicrobial Compound Efflux (PACE) family and Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) family. A lot of work has been done on understanding and characterizing the roles that these efflux pumps play in relation to antimicrobial resistance and the physiology of these bacteria. RND efflux pumps, with their expansive substrate profiles, are a major component of Acinetobacter spp. antimicrobial resistance. New discoveries over the last decade have shed a lot of light on to the complex regulation of these efflux pumps leading to greater understanding and potential of slowing the reduced susceptibility seen by these bacterial species.",1098-6596 (Electronic) 0066-4804 (Linking),2021 Apr 26,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6395-7932'],"['AAC.00514-21 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.00514-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society for Microbiology.'],,

METHODS: An isolate collection of 57 E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. was tested. Ca(2+) in concentrations from 2.5-40 mM was added to the Mueller-Hinton agar plates used for gradient MIC and disk diffusion tests. Broth microdilution (ISO 20776-1) MIC determination was used as reference. E. coli and K. pneumoniae were investigated for colistin resistance genes. RESULTS: Results were similar for gradient tests and disk diffusion for all species. Correlation between phenotypic expression of resistance and resistance genes was not absolute. Addition of Ca(2+) to Mueller-Hinton agar improved separation between colistin susceptible and resistant isolates for E. coli. For K. pneumoniae, separation was improved for isolates with mcr genes, but not for isolates harbouring other colistin resistance mechanisms. To further increase the concentrations of Ca(2+) did not improve the separation between susceptible and resistant isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae. For P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species, addition of Ca(2+) did not improve separation between susceptible and resistant populations.

Therefore, we evaluated the AMR features and resistance mechanisms of the ESKAPEE pathogens collected in a tertiary hospital located in the capital of Malaysia. METHODS: A total of 378 AMR-ESKAPEE strains were obtained based on convenience sampling over a nine-month study period (2019-2020). All strains were subjected to disk diffusion and broth microdilution assays to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequence analyses were performed to determine the AMR genes profiles of the non-susceptible strains. Chi-square test and logistic regression analyses were used to correlate the AMR profiles and clinical data to determine the risk factors associated with HAIs. RESULTS: High rates of multidrug resistance (MDR) were observed in A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and S. aureus (69-89%). All organisms except E. coli were frequently associated with HAIs (61-94%). Non-susceptibility to the last-resort drugs vancomycin (in Enterococcus spp. and S. aureus), carbapenems (in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae), and colistin (in Enterobacteriaceae) were observed. Both A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae harbored a wide array of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaOXA). Metallo-beta-lactamase genes (blaVEB, blaVIM, blaNDM) were detected in carbapenem-resistant strains, at a higher frequency compared to other local reports. We detected two novel mutations in the quinolone-resistant determining region of the gyrA in fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (Leu-102-Ala; Gly-105-Val). Microbial resistance to ampicillin, methicillin, and cephalosporins was identified as important risk factors associated with HAIs in the hospital.

Data concerning the impact of BSI due to ESKAPEEc in pediatric population was virtually scant. Our purpose was to summarize the epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of ESKAPEEc BSI among hospitalized children. METHODS: Inpatients diagnosed with BSI with definite etiology between January 2016 and December 2018 were enrolled retrospectively at the West China Second University Hospital. Data were systematically reviewed on patients' clinical characteristics and laboratory findings to ascertain independent predictors, clinical features and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 228 patients with BSI, 174 (76.3%) were caused by ESKAPEEc (124 MDR-ESKAPEEc). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that premature and/ or low birth weight (odds ratio [OR] = 2.981, P = 0.036), previous surgery and/or trauma (OR = 5.71, P = 0.029) and source of urinary tract infection (OR = 10.60, P = 0.004) were independently associated with ESKAPEEc BSI. The independent risk factor for MRD-ESKAPEEc BSI was nosocomial infection (OR = 3.314, P = 0.037). The overall mortality rate in patients with ESKAPEEc BSI was 14.4% (25/174), and no significant difference was ascertained in mortality between MRD-ESKAPEEc and non-MRD ESKAPEEc BSI groups (13.7% vs. 11.4%, P = 0.692). In addition, previous surgery and/or trauma, thrombocytopenia, and mechanical ventilation were significant risk factors for mortality caused by ESKAPEEc BSI. CONCLUSIONS: More than two-thirds of BSI among hospitalized children were caused by ESKAPEEc.

Because clinical relevance and antibiotic susceptibility are significantly different among different genomic species of Acinetobacter, the exact identification of A. baumannii is necessary and it can help us prevent inappropriate antibiotic use and inferior clinical care. This project employed a sequence-specific PCR assay for the rpoB region in A. baumannii to distinguish it from non-Acinetobacter baumannii Acinetobacter species. Moreover, a duplex PCR assay was used to detect blaOXA-51-like and gluconolactonase genes as a second identification method. In this study, 210 isolates of Acinetobacter spp. were considered and identified by PCR-sequencing of rpoB gene as a reference test. PCR-sequencing of rpoB revealed that 179 isolates were A. baumannii and 31 were non- A. baumannii Acinetobacter strains. PCR amplification targeting the rpoB gene as the first method, detected 182 isolates of A. baumannii, while duplex PCR assay confirmed 163 isolates as A. baumannii. Data analysis indicated that the sensitivities of sequence-specific PCR of the rpoB gene and duplex PCR assay were 100% and 91.06%, respectively, while specificities were 91.18% and 100%, respectively. Given the data, it was revealed that these two methods showed a reasonable potential for the accurate identification of A. baumannnii from non- A. baumannii species.

13,33907816,"['Chan, Derek C K', 'Burrows, Lori L']",Thiocillin and micrococcin exploit the ferrioxamine receptor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for uptake.,"BACKGROUND: Thiopeptides are a class of antibiotics that are active against Gram-positive bacteria and inhibit translation. They were considered inactive against Gram-negative bacteria due to their inability to cross the outer membrane. However, we discovered previously that a member of this class, thiostrepton (TS), has activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii under iron-limiting conditions. TS hijacks the pyoverdine siderophore receptors of P. aeruginosa to cross the outer membrane and synergizes with iron chelators. OBJECTIVES: To test other thiopeptides for antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa and determine their mechanism of uptake, action and spectrum of activity. METHODS: Eight thiopeptides were screened in chequerboard assays against a mutant of P. aeruginosa PA14 lacking both pyoverdine receptors. Thiopeptides that retain activity against a pyoverdine receptor-null mutant may use alternative siderophore receptors for entry. Susceptibility testing against siderophore receptor mutants was used to determine thiopeptide mechanism of uptake. RESULTS: The thiopeptides thiocillin (TC) and micrococcin (MC) use the ferrioxamine siderophore receptor (FoxA) for uptake and inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa at low micromolar concentrations. The activity of TC required the TonB-ExbBD system used to energize siderophore uptake. TC acted through its canonical mechanism of action of translation inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple thiopeptides have antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa, countering the historical assumption that they cannot cross the outer membrane. These results demonstrate the potential for thiopeptides to act as antipseudomonal antibiotics.",1460-2091 (Electronic) 0305-7453 (Linking),2021 Apr 28,,"['6256240 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkab124 [doi]']",['eng'],England,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

The evaluation of synergistic effects between the antibiotics against this pathogen is among the efforts to counteract its antimicrobial resistance. This study aimed to evaluate possible synergistic effect of colistin and ampicillin/sulbactam (separately) with several antibiotics against clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) A. baumannii. METHODS: Acinetobacter baumannii strains were isolated from biological samples of hospitalized patients with any type of nosocomial infection related to this pathogen. Only MDR strains (resistance to at least three classes of antibiotics including cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides) were included in the study. After determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics against the isolates by broth microdilution test, the checkerboard method was used for evaluation of any possible synergistic effect of both colistin and ampicillin/sulbactam with several other antibiotics. RESULTS: Twenty isolates underwent synergy test for colistin and 20 isolates for ampicillin/sulbacatam. Doxycycline (55%), azithromycin (35%), and co-trimoxazole (35%) had the most frequency of synergistic effect with colistin. On the other hand, amikacin and gentamicin (55%), doxycycline (50%), co-trimoxazole (45%), azithromycin (40%), and cefepime (40%) had the most frequency of synergistic effect with ampicillin/sulbactam. No antagonistic effect was observed for both antibiotics.

This study investigated carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains exhibiting an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) phenotype, including four isolates considered locally pan drug-resistant (LPDR), isolated from inpatients during an outbreak at a teaching hospital in Brazil. ApaI DNA macrorestriction followed by PFGE clustered the strains in three pulsotypes, named A to C, among carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains. Pulsotypes A and B clustered six polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii strains. MLST analysis of representative strains of pulsotypes A, B, and C showed that they belong, respectively, to sequence types ST1 (clonal complex, CC1), ST79 (CC79), and ST903. Genomic analysis of international clones ST1 and ST79 representative strains predicted a wide resistome for beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with bla OXA-23 and bla OXA-72 genes encoding carbapenem resistance. Amino acid substitutions in PmrB (Thr232Ile or Pro170Leu) and PmrC (Arg125His) were responsible for polymyxin resistance. Although colistin MICs were all high (MIC >/= 128 mg/L), polymyxin B MICs varied; strains with Pro170Leu substitution in PmrB had MICs > 128 mg/L, while those with Thr232Ile had lower MICs (16-64 mg/L), irrespective of the clone. Although the first identified polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii strain belonged to ST79, the ST1 strains were endemic and caused the outbreak most likely due to polymyxin B use. The genome comparison of two ST1 strains from the same patient, but one susceptible and the other resistant to polymyxin, revealed mutations in 28 ORFs in addition to pmrBC. The ORF codifying an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase has gained attention due to its fatty acid breakdown and membrane fluidity involvement. However, the role of these mutations in the polymyxin resistance mechanism remains unknown. To prevent the dissemination of XDR bacteria, the hospital infection control committee implemented the patient bathing practice with a 2% chlorhexidine solution, a higher concentration than all A. baumannii chlorhexidine MICs.

These samples were collected from Indian and KSA local supermarkets to ensure consistency in their therapeutic effects. Methods: EOs were extracted from Indian and KSA A. subulatum fruit samples using a hydro-distillation method and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii) was determined using minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration methods. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were determined using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl-induced free radical assay, and a bovine albumin inhibitory assay, respectively. These analyses were performed to evaluate the pharmacological activities of the substances. Results: GC-MS retention times of both samples demonstrated 56 bioactive ingredients with different percentages. The principal bioactive compounds in the Indian and Saudi Arabian EO samples were 1,8-cineole (44.24% and 46.22%, respectively), alpha-terpineol (7.47% and 7.04%, respectively), terpinen-4-ol (5.01% and 4.83%, respectively), geraniol D (4.05% and 3.54%, respectively), and beta-pinene (3.38% and 3.98%, respectively). Superior antimicrobial activity against the selected strains was observed for both samples, with an MIC range of 0.5%-1%. Antioxidant assays demonstrated moderate activity in both samples. Moreover, the Indian and Saudi Arabian samples exhibited IC50 values of 53.12% and 55.26 mug/mL, respectively, in albumin denaturation inhibition assays.

The aim of the study was to analyze the Gram-negative isolates obtained from oral cavity of the mechanically ventilated patients in ICUs, after prophylactic application of antibiotics and their resistance mechanisms and to compare them with the isolates obtained from tracheal aspirates from the same patients. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined by broth dilution method. PCR was applied to detect genes encoding beta-lactamases. Marked diversity of Gram-negative bacteria and resistance mechanisms was found. High resistance rates and high rate of blaCTX-M and carbapenemase encoding genes (blaVIM-1 , blaOXA-48 ) were found among Klebsiella pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to harbour blaVIM and in one strain blaPER-1 gene, whereas Acinetobacter baumannii produced OXA-23-like and OXA-24/40-like oxacillinases and was XDR in all except one case. All XDR isolates belong to international clonal lineage II (IC II). The main finding of the study is that the prophlylactic application of antibiotics in surgery intensive care units (ICUs) is associated with the colonization of oral cavity and lower respiratory tract with Gram-negative bacteria. The identity of Gram-negative bacteria in oral cavity reflected those found in endotracheal aspirates leading to conclusion that oral swab as non-invasive specimen can predict the colonization of lower respiratory tract with resistant Gram-negative organisms and the risk for development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.",1472-765X (Electronic) 0266-8254 (Linking),2021 Apr 25,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9975-6830'],['10.1111/lam.13493 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'carbapenemases', 'extended-spectrum beta-lactamases', 'microbiome', 'oral cavity', 'ventilator associated pneumonia']",['This article is protected by copyright.

While most studies have focused on potential pathogens, this study aimed to find bacteria that could be protective against OME through a case-control microbiome study and characterization of isolates from healthy subjects. The URT and ear microbiome profiles of 70 chronic OME patients and 53 controls were compared by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent classic middle ear pathobiont. However, other taxa, especially Alloiococcus otitis, were also frequently detected in the ear canal of OME patients. Streptococci of the salivarius group and Acinetobacter lwoffii were more abundant in the nasopharynx of healthy controls than in OME patients. In addition to the microbiome analysis, 142 taxa were isolated from healthy individuals, and 79 isolates of 13 different Streptococcus species were tested for their pathobiont-inhibiting potential. Of these, Streptococcus salivarius isolates showed a superior capacity to inhibit the growth of H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, A. otitis, and Corynebacterium otitidis S. salivarius strains thus show potential as a probiotic for prevention or treatment of OME based on their overrepresentation in the healthy nasopharynx and their ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathobionts.

The neck-thyroid shield PLGs was generally more contaminated than body apron PLGs and exhibited significantly higher loads of Staphylococcus epidermidis (P = 0.048). Other pathogen cultured were Micrococcus spp., Acinetobacter lwoffii (A. lwoffii), Bacillus species (Bacillus spp.), Moraxella osloensis (M. osloensis) and Pseudomonas stutzeri (P. stutzeri). No other common pathogens associated with SSI or PJI were detected. Conclusions: PLGs are heavily contaminated despite regular cleaning protocols. Neck PLGs are highly contaminated with potentially infectious agents. As neck PLGs are often directly exposed above the surgical sterile gown and the surgical field, measures should be undertaken to reduce their exposure and bacterial load, perhaps by suggesting users consider avoiding the use of intraoperative fluoroscopy when possible or alternatively supporting the use of body exhaust suits when PLGs are needed.",1757-1774 (Print) 1757-1782 (Linking),2020 Nov,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8025-5964', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9332-6170']","['10.1177/1757177420947466 [doi]', '10.1177_1757177420947466 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['PLG', 'Protective lead garments', 'aprons', 'bacterial contamination', 'thyroid shield']",['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,

The reuse of treated wastewater is an important alternative to supply agricultural demands for water. In Jordan, Kherbet Al-Samra wastewater treatment plant (KSWWTP) is the largest and its effluent is mainly used for irrigation purposes. In this study, bacterial contamination and mutagenic potential were evaluated in six sites, beginning with KSWWTP and ending with King Tallal Dam. The results showed high contamination with many pathogenic bacteria and coliforms. The isolated pathogenic bacteria were Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. The isolated opportunistic pathogenic bacteria were Acinetobacter lwoffii, Elizabethkingia meningosepticum, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus licheniformis. These bacteria were found in all sampling sites without a specific prevalence pattern. Differences in temperature between seasons affect total coliform and other bacterial count. All water samples showed positive mutagenic activity and high bacterial pollution. Improving the disinfection efficiency in the wastewater treatment plant is important to minimize potential toxicity and exposure of public health to pathogenic bacteria, reduce water resources' contamination and environmental pollution. Increasing effluent sampling frequency from KSWWTP is required to monitor bacterial contamination and toxicity/mutagenicity level for water safety and public health risk assessments.",1477-8920 (Print) 1477-8920 (Linking),2020 Dec,,['10.2166/wh.2020.193 [doi]'],['eng'],England,,,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Waste Water)', 'Acinetobacter lwoffii']","['Acinetobacter', 'Jordan', 'Mutagens', 'Waste Disposal, Fluid', '*Waste Water', 'Water Microbiology', '*Water Purification']"

Their ability to adapt to different living conditions is largely due to the presence of numerous plasmids containing the necessary adaptive genes. At the same time the diversity of Acinetobacter plasmids and their evolutionary dynamics have not been sufficiently studied. Here, we characterized 44 plasmids isolated from five permafrost Acinetobacter lwoffii strains, examined their relationship with plasmids of modern Acinetobacter strains and identified groups of related plasmids. For this purpose, we have developed a combined approach for classifying all known Acinetobacter plasmids. The classification took into account the size of plasmids, the presence and structure of the rep and mob genes, as well as the structure of their backbone and accessory regions. Based on the analysis, 19 major groups (lineages) of plasmids were identified, of which more than half were small plasmids. The plasmids of each group have common features of the organization of the backbone region with a DNA identity level of at least 80%. In addition, plasmids of the same group have similarities in the organization of accessory regions. We also described a number of plasmids with a unique structure. The presence of plasmids in clinical strains that are closely related to those of environmental permafrost strains provides evidence of the origin of the former from the latter.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2020,,['10.3389/fmicb.2020.588410 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['adaptation of bacteria', 'backbone and accessory regions', 'phylogenetic analysis', 'relaxases', 'replication initiator proteins']","['Copyright (c) 2020 Mindlin, Beletsky, Rakitin, Mardanov and Petrova.']",,

Metabarcoding and bioinformatics approaches to infer functional prediction were applied in bottom sediments of a tributary drainage channel of Rio de La Plata estuary, in order to assess the biological contribution to MNR. Hydrocarbon concentration in water samples and surface sediments was below the detection limit. Surface sediments were represented with high available phosphorous, alkaline pH, and the bacterial classes Anaerolineae, Planctomycetia, and Deltaproteobacteria. The functional prediction in surface sediments showed an increase of metabolic activity, carbon fixation, methanogenesis, and synergistic relationships between Archaeas, Syntrophobacterales, and Desulfobacterales. The prediction in non-surface sediments suggested the capacity to respond to different kinds of environmental stresses (oxidative, osmotic, heat, acid pH, and heavy metals), predicted mostly in Lactobacillales order, and the capacity of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinomyces classes to degrade xenobiotic compounds.

METHODS: Herein, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 12 children with DRE and 12 matched healthy controls to compare the changes in fecal microbiomes and SCFAs. Disease cohort also underwent analysis before and after 6 months of KD treatment. RESULTS: A higher microbial alpha diversity and a significant increase in Actinobacteria at the phylum level and Enterococcus, Anaerostipes, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Blautia at the genus level were observed in the children with DRE. The abundance of the eight epileptic-associated genera was reversed after six months of KD treatment with decreases in Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, Enterococcaceae and Actinomyces and increases in Subdoligranulum, Dialister, Alloprevotella (p < 0.05). In particular, we identified some taxa that were more prevalent in patients with an inadequate response to KD than in those with an adequate response. Further, a significant correlation was observed between the change in the microbiome genera after KD treatment. The SCFA content in the fecal after 6 months of KD treatment increased and was highly correlated with the gut bacteria.

Methods: Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), and Actinomyces naeslundii (A. naeslundii) were chose to form a multispecies biofilm. Different concentration (0-40%) of sucrose was introduced to the multispecies biofilm 3 times per day (30 min per time). And then the bacteria proportion and acid production of the biofilms were analyzed. Results: Increasing sucrose level increased CFU count of S. mutans up to a certain concentration (5% sucrose), after which the number of S. mutans slightly decreased, but the CFU counts of S. oralis and A. naeslundii continually decreased with sucrose concentration increase, especially, from 5% sucrose, the reduction was significant, and S. mutans became the dominant species in the biofilms. Furthermore, the acid production ability of the multispecies biofilm gradually increased and slightly decreased with sucrose concentration increased, and the turning concentration was 5%. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that increasing sucrose level could increase the competitiveness of S. mutans in the multispecies biofilm, which may shift the biofilm to a more cariogenic one, and 5% sucrose formed a most cariogenic biofilm in this study.",2000-2297 (Print) 2000-2297 (Linking),2021 Apr 7,,"['10.1080/20002297.2021.1910443 [doi]', '1910443 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,"['Sucrose', 'dental caries', 'microbial homeostasis', 'multispecies biofilm', 'relationship']","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

METHODS: Saliva samples were obtained from 35 caries-free preschool children (18 boys and 17 girls) with primary dentition, and 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the microorganisms were analyzed using Illumina MiSeq. RESULTS: At 97% similarity level, all of these reads were clustered into 334 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Among these, five phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Candidate division TM7) and 13 genera (Streptococcus, Rothia, Granulicatella, Prevotella, Enterobacter, Veillonella, Neisseria, Staphylococcus, Janthinobacterium, Pseudomonas, Brevundimonas, Devosia, and Gemella) were the most dominant, constituting 99.4% and 89.9% of the salivary microbiota, respectively.

After resuscitation, surgical exploration revealed a purulent pericardial effusion with tamponade and a liver abscess. Microbiological analyses from both sites were negative. Shortly after surgical exploration, she developed multiorgan failure and died. At autopsy, pus was observed both within the pericardial cavity and around the left lobe of the liver. Green ""sulfur granules"" suggestive of infection with Actinomyces spp. were able to be extruded from the liver during the postmortem examination and cultures returned positive for Actinomyces israelii.

In most of the cases, they occur near to the primary focus, and in the cervicofacial area. Systemic dissemination with cutaneous distant metastasis is rare, most often related to A. israelii, too. We report an original case of upper limb actinomycosis associated with an oral localisation and due to an unusual bacteria. CASE REPORT: A 49-year-old man was referred to the Department of dermatology for a skin lesion of the left hand and wrist. Biopsies revealed actinomycosis related to A. meyeri. Dental primary focus was identified and treated. Although the patient was lost sight of, dental eradication and prolonged antibiotics therapy allowed cutaneous improvement. DISCUSSION: We report an atypical case of cutaneous actinomycosis due to an Actinomyces meyeri dental infection occurring in an immunocompetent, smoking adult, with poor oral hygiene. The literature review revealed only 4 well-documented cases of cutaneous A. meyeri infections distant to dental primary focus.

Promising agents are antimicrobial peptides which are host defense molecules of the innate immune system in a wide range of different species. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the activity of nisin, melittin, lactoferrin, parasin-1 and LL-37 against 35 oral bacteria and Candida albicans employing the gold standard method for anaerobic susceptibility testing. Methods: The activity of the peptides was determined by an agar dilution method under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. The test media contained final peptide concentrations between 0.125 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml (melittin, lactoferrin, parasin-1, LL-37) and between 0.125 microg/ml and 128 microg/ml (nisin). Results: Nisin completely inhibited the growth of Megasphaera sp., Bifidobacterium longum, Parvimonas micra, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus and Staphylococcus aureus. Melittin and lactoferrin reduced the growth of Megasphaera sp., P. micra, B. longum (melittin) and Selenomonas flueggei (lactoferrin). Parasin-1 and LL-37 showed no activity.

All patients of canaliculitis managed with intracanalicular antibiotic ointment loading and with a minimum follow up of 3 months were included in the study. The antibiotic ointment was loaded into the canaliculus based on the antibiotic sensitivity of the material expressed out from the canaliculus. Patients' demographics, clinical details, microbiological profile and management outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were included in the study. Mean age at presentation was 58.41 +/- 9.4 years. The right eye was involved in 15 (62.5%, p = .0424) cases. The incidence of lower canaliculus involvement (14, 58.33%, p = .022) was significantly higher as compared to the upper canaliculus (8, 33.33%).

Along with many other agricultural technologies, the global production of genetically engineered crops has steadily grown since they were first introduced 25 years ago. Since the first transfer of DNA into plant cells using Agrobacterium tumefaciens, different transformation methods have enabled rapid advances in molecular breeding approaches to bring crop varieties with novel traits to the market that would be difficult or not possible to achieve with conventional breeding methods. Today, transformation to produce genetically engineered crops is the fastest and most widely adopted technology in agriculture. The rapidly increasing number of sequenced plant genomes and information from functional genomics data to understand gene function, together with novel gene cloning and tissue culture methods, is further accelerating crop improvement and trait development. These advances are welcome and needed to make crops more resilient to climate change and to secure their yield for feeding the increasing human population. Despite the success, transformation remains a bottleneck because many plant species and crop genotypes are recalcitrant to established tissue culture and regeneration conditions, or they show poor transformability. Improvements are possible using morphogenetic transcriptional regulators, but their broader applicability remains to be tested. Advances in genome editing techniques and direct, non-tissue culture-based transformation methods offer alternative approaches to enhance varietal development in other recalcitrant crops.

Using metagenomics technique, we found the rhizosphere microbiomes dynamically altered as the dose of these stresses increased. We also identified stressor-associated metagenome-assembled genomes and microbial metabolic pathways as well as mobile genetic elements in the rhizosphere microbiomes.

A monomorphic subpopulation of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae biovar 3 (Psa3) is responsible for the pandemic worldwide. Diversity in pathogenicity has been found in the pandemic subpopulation and in other Psa3 subpopulations causing epidemics in China. However, the genetic bases have not yet been elucidated. In this study, 117 Psa3 isolates were identified by Psa- and Psa3-specific primers, and evaluated for pathogenicity. Three isolates G4, G40, and S2 are not pathogenic to kiwifruit and do not elicit hypersensitivity responses (HRs) in non-host Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Two isolates, G25 and G35, exhibited attenuated HR-eliciting activity in non-host N. benthamiana, but they exhibited greatly and slightly reduced pathogenicity in host plants, respectively. The genomes of the five isolates were sequenced and compared with closely related isolates revealed by MLVA and whole-genome typing methods. The candidate genetic loci responsible for the changes in pathogenicity and HR elicitation, were further evaluated by allele replacement experiments. We found that the three non-pathogenic isolates were formed due to the independent, identical insertion events of ISPsy36 transposon in the hrpR gene, encoding a key regulator of type III secretion system (T3SS) and type III effectors (T3Es). In the symptomatic sample from which G4 was isolated, 27% HR negative isolates were detected. In isolate G25, transposon insertion of ISPsy32 at the non-coding sequence upstream of the hrpR gene was detected, similar to a previously reported low-virulent Psa3 strain M227. In isolate G35, we detected disruptions of T3Es hopBB1-1 and hopBB1-2, which induce HR in N. benthamiana leaves revealed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration. These phenotype-changed isolates were formed at low frequencies during the course of pathogen infection in host plants, supported by the binding assay of ISPsy32 and the non-coding DNA sequences upstream of the hrpR gene, the co-isolation of the virulent isolates belonging to the same MLVA clade, and the low levels of transcription of the transposon genes. Taken together, in terms of short-term field evolution, transposon insertions in the T3SS-related genes resulted in the formation of non-pathogenic and low-virulent Psa3 isolates.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fmicb.2021.650099 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['T3SS', 'bacterial canker of kiwifruit', 'comparative genomics', 'hrpR', 'non-pathogenic', 'transposable elements']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Zhu, Zhi, Fan, Xie, Zhao, Long and Li.']",,

It is well known that Bacillus is considered to be a promising source of bioactive secondary metabolites. Most plant pathogens have an incredible ability to mutate and acquire resistance, causing major economic losses in the agricultural field. Therefore, it is necessary to use the natural antibacterial compounds in microbes to control plant pathogens. This study was conducted to investigate the bio-active compounds of Bacillus megaterium L2. According to the activity guidance of Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-37, Erwinia carotovora EC-1 and Ralstonia solanacearum RS-2, five monomeric compounds, including erucamide (1), behenic acid (2), palmitic acid (3), phenylacetic acid (4), and beta-sitosterol (5), were fractionated and purified from the crude ethyl acetate extract of B. megaterium. To our knowledge, all compounds were isolated from the bacterium for the first time. To understand the antimicrobial activity of these compounds, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (range: 0.98 approximately 500 mug/mL) were determined by the broth microdilution method. For the three tested pathogens, palmitic acid exhibited almost no antibacterial activity (>500 mug/mL), while erucamide had moderate antibacterial activity (MIC = 500 mug/mL). Behenic acid showed MICs of 250 mug/mL against T-37 and RS-2 strains with an antibacterial activity. beta-sitosterol showed significant antimicrobial activity against RS-2. beta-sitosterol showed remarkable antimicrobial activity against RS-2 with an MIC of 15.6 mug/mL.

Many bacteria alter their PG chemistry as a strategy to adapt their cell wall to external challenges. Therefore, identifying these environmental cues is important to better understand the interplay between microbes and their habitat. Here we used the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida to uncover cell wall modulators from plant extracts and found canavanine (CAN), a non-proteinogenic amino acid. We demonstrated that cell wall chemical editing by CAN is licensed by P. putida BSAR, a broad-spectrum racemase which catalyzes production of DL-CAN from L-CAN, which is produced by many legumes. Importantly, D-CAN diffuses to the extracellular milieu thereby having a potential impact on other organisms inhabiting the same niche. Our results show that D-CAN alters dramatically the PG structure of Rhizobiales (e.g. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti), impairing PG crosslinkage and cell division. Using A. tumefaciens we demonstrated that the detrimental effect of D-CAN is suppressed by a single amino acid substitution in the cell division PG transpeptidase penicillin binding protein 3a.

The paradigm earlier step of biotin synthesis denotes ""BioC-BioH"" pathway in Escherichia coli. Here we report that BioZ bypasses the canonical route to begin biotin synthesis. In addition to its origin of Rhizobiales, protein phylogeny infers that BioZ is domesticated to gain an atypical role of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III. Genetic and biochemical characterization demonstrates that BioZ catalyzes the condensation of glutaryl-CoA (or ACP) with malonyl-ACP to give 5'-keto-pimeloyl ACP. This intermediate proceeds via type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) pathway, to initiate the formation of pimeloyl-ACP, a precursor of biotin synthesis.

Thus, we established an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) system for genetic transformation of a mycobiont isolated from Cladonia macilenta. A set of combinations of ATMT conditions, such as input biomass of mycobiont, co-cultivation period with Agrobacterium cells, and incubation temperature, were tested to identify an optimized ATMT condition for the C. macilenta mycobiont. As a result, more than 10 days of co-cultivation period and at least 2 mg of input biomass of the mycobiont were recommended for an efficient ATMT, owing to extremely slow growth rate of mycobionts in general. Moreover, we examined T-DNA copy number variation in a total of 180 transformants and found that 88% of the transformants had a single copy T-DNA insertion. To identify precise T-DNA insertion sites that interrupt gene function in C. macilenta, we performed TAIL-PCR analyses for selected transformants. A hypothetical gene encoding ankyrin repeats at its C-terminus was interrupted by T-DNA insertion in a transformant producing dark-brown colored pigment. Although the identification of the pigment awaits further investigation, this proof-of-concept study demonstrated the feasibility of use of ATMT in construction of a random T-DNA insertion mutant library in mycobionts for studying genetic mechanisms behind the lichen symbiosis, stress tolerance, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.",2309-608X (Electronic) 2309-608X (Linking),2021 Mar 26,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4612-4530', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9094-8908', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8547-7075']","['jof7040252 [pii]', '10.3390/jof7040252 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['ATMT', 'Agrobacterium', 'Cladonia', 'genetic transformation', 'lichen-forming fungi']",,,

Genetic Transformation: Current Status and Future Prospects.,"Olive (Olea europaea L.) is the most characteristic and important oil crop of the Mediterranean region. Traditional olive cultivation is based on few tens cultivars of ancient origin. To improve this crop, novel selections with higher tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, adaptable to high-density planting systems and resilient to climate change are needed; however, breeding programs are hindered by the long juvenile period of this species and few improved genotypes have been released so far. Genetic transformation could be of great value, in the near future, to develop new varieties or rootstocks in a shorter time; in addition, it has currently become an essential tool for functional genomic studies. The recalcitrance of olive tissues to their in vitro manipulation has been the main bottleneck in the development of genetic transformation procedures in this species; however, some important traits such as fungal resistance, flowering or lipid composition have successfully been manipulated through the genetic transformation of somatic embryos of juvenile or adult origin, providing a proof of the potential role that this technology could have in olive improvement. However, the optimization of these protocols for explants of adult origin is a prerequisite to obtain useful materials for the olive industry. In this review, initially, factors affecting plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis are discussed. Subsequently, the different transformation approaches explored in olive are reviewed.

Two-component signal transduction systems are one of the predominant means used by bacteria to sense the signals of the host plant and adjust their interaction behaviour. A total of seven open reading frames have been identified as putative two-component response regulators in the gram-negative nitrogen-fixing bacteria Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571. However, the biological functions of these response regulators in the symbiotic interactions between A. caulinodans ORS571 and the host plant Sesbania rostrata have not been elucidated to date. RESULTS: In this study, we identified and investigated a two-component response regulator, AcfR, with a phosphorylatable N-terminal REC (receiver) domain and a C-terminal HTH (helix-turn-helix) LuxR DNA-binding domain in A. caulinodans ORS571. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AcfR possessed close evolutionary relationships with NarL/FixJ family regulators. In addition, six histidine kinases containing HATPase_c and HisKA domains were predicted to interact with AcfR. Furthermore, the biological function of AcfR in free-living and symbiotic conditions was elucidated by comparing the wild-type strain and the DeltaacfR mutant strain. In the free-living state, the cell motility behaviour and exopolysaccharide production of the DeltaacfR mutant were significantly reduced compared to those of the wild-type strain. In the symbiotic state, the DeltaacfR mutant showed a competitive nodule defect on the stems and roots of the host plant, suggesting that AcfR can provide A. caulinodans with an effective competitive ability for symbiotic nodulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that AcfR, as a response regulator, regulates numerous phenotypes of A. caulinodans under the free-living conditions and in symbiosis with the host plant. The results of this study help to elucidate the involvement of a REC + HTH_LuxR two-component response regulator in the Rhizobium-host plant interaction.",1471-2180 (Electronic) 1471-2180 (Linking),2021 Mar 9,,"['10.1186/s12866-021-02138-w [doi]', '10.1186/s12866-021-02138-w [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Bacterial motility', 'Competitive nodulation', 'Exopolysaccharides', 'HTH_LuxR domain', 'REC domain', 'Two-component response regulator']",,,

The localization of chemotactic proteins in the cell is critical for coordinating a maximal response to chemotactic signals. One chemotaxis protein with a well-defined subcellular localization is the phosphatase CheZ. CheZ localizes to cell poles by binding with CheA in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, or binding with a poorly understood protein called ChePep in epsilon-Proteobacteria. In alpha-Proteobacteria, CheZ lacks CheA-binding sites, and its cellular localization remains unknown. We therefore determined the localization of CheZ in the alpha-Proteobacteria Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571. A. caulinodans CheZ, also termed as CheZAC, was found to be located to cell poles independently of CheA, and we suspect that either the N-terminal helix or the four-helix bundle of CheZAC is sufficient to locate to cell poles. We also found a novel motif, AXXFQ, which is adjacent to the phosphatase active motif DXXXQ, which effects the monopolar localization of CheZAC. This novel motif consisting of AXXFQ is conserved in CheZ and widely distributed among Proteobacteria. Finally, we found that the substitution of phosphatase active site affects the polar localization of CheZAC. In total, this work characterized the localization pattern of CheZ containing a novel motif, and we mapped the regions of CheZAC that are critical for its polar localization.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2020,,['10.3389/fmicb.2020.585140 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Azorhizobium caulinodans', 'CheZ', 'cellular localization', 'chemotaxis', 'rhizobia']","['Copyright (c) 2020 Liu, Liu, Johnson, Dong and Xie.']",,

To determine the contributions of CheY1 and CheY2, we compared the wild type (WT) and mutants in the free-living state and in symbiosis with the host Sesbania rostrata Swim plate tests and capillary assays revealed that both CheY1 and CheY2 play roles in chemotaxis, with CheY2 having a more prominent role than CheY1. In an analysis of the swimming paths of free-swimming cells, the DeltacheY1 mutant exhibited decreased frequency of direction reversal, whereas the DeltacheY2 mutant appeared to change direction much more frequently than the WT. Exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in the DeltacheY1 and DeltacheY2 mutants was lower than that in the WT, but the DeltacheY2 mutant had more obvious EPS defects that were similar to those of the DeltacheY1 DeltacheY2 and Deltaeps1 mutants. During symbiosis, the levels of competitiveness for root colonization and nodule occupation of DeltacheY1 and DeltacheY2 mutants were impaired compared to those of the WT. Moreover, the competitive colonization ability of the DeltacheY2 mutant was severely impaired compared to that of the DeltacheY1 mutant. Taken together, the DeltacheY2 phenotypes are more severe than the DeltacheY1 phenotype in free-living and symbiotic states, and that of the double mutant resembles the DeltacheY2 single-mutant phenotype. These defects of DeltacheY1 and DeltacheY2 mutants were restored to the WT phenotype by complementation. These results suggest that there are different regulatory mechanisms of CheY1 and CheY2 and that CheY2 is a key chemotaxis regulator under free-living and symbiosis conditions.IMPORTANCE Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 is a motile soil bacterium that has the dual capacity to fix nitrogen both under free-living conditions and in symbiosis with Sesbania rostrata, forming nitrogen-fixing root and stem nodules. Bacterial chemotaxis to chemoattractants derived from host roots promotes infection and subsequent nodule formation by directing rhizobia to appropriate sites of infection. In this work, we identified and demonstrated that CheY2, a chemotactic response regulator encoded by a gene outside the chemotaxis cluster, is required for chemotaxis and multiple other cell phenotypes. CheY1, encoded by a gene in the chemotaxis cluster, also plays a role in chemotaxis. Two response regulators mediate bacterial chemotaxis and motility in different ways.

Previous studies have elaborated on resistance to these oxygen radicals in several bacteria; however, to the best of our knowledge, none have investigated this process in A. caulinodans. In this study, we identified and characterised the organic hydroperoxide resistance gene ohr (AZC_2977) and its regulator ohrR (AZC_3555) in A. caulinodans ORS571. Hypersensitivity to organic hydroperoxide was observed in an ohr mutant. While using a lacZ-based reporter system, we revealed that OhrR repressed the expression of ohr. Moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that OhrR regulated ohr by direct binding to its promoter region. We showed that this binding was prevented by OhrR oxidation under aerobic conditions, which promoted OhrR dimerization and the activation of ohr. Furthermore, we showed that one of the two conserved cysteine residues in OhrR, Cys11, was critical for the sensitivity to organic hydroperoxides. Plant assays revealed that the inactivation of Ohr decreased the number of stem nodules and nitrogenase activity. Our data demonstrated that Ohr and OhrR are required for protecting A. caulinodans from organic hydroperoxide stress and play an important role in the interaction of the bacterium with plants.

Three domains were identified in the Chp1: a PAS domain, a degenerate GGDEF domain, and an EAL domain. An in vitro enzymatic activity assay showed that the degenerate GGDEF domain of Chp1 did not have diguanylate cyclase activity. The phosphodiesterase activity of Chp1 was attributed to its EAL domain which could hydrolyse c-di-GMP into pGpG. The PAS domain functioned as a regulatory domain by sensing oxygen. Deletion of Chp1 resulted in increased intracellular c-di-GMP level, decreased motility, increased aggregation, and increased EPS (extracellular polysaccharide) production. H2O2-sensitivity assay showed that increased EPS production could provide ORS571 with resistance against H2O2. Thus, the elevated nodulation efficiency of the chp1 mutant could be correlated with a protective role of EPS in the nodulation process.

TlpA1, a transmembrane chemoreceptor, was found to be involved in the chemotactic response to these organic acids. Oxalic acid played a direct role in the chemotactic response, but it also played an indirect role by promoting or inhibiting the chemotactic response toward other chemoeffectors. Furthermore, the indirect role of oxalic acid on other chemoeffectors was concentration-dependent. The effect of oxalic acid at different concentrations on host root colonization was also determined.

Mossbauer spectroscopic analysis of these samples bound to the nitrogenase maturase Azotobacter vinelandii NifX reveals differences in the primary coordination sphere of the terminal Fe sites and that one of the terminal sites of the L-cluster binds to H35 of Av NifX.

Genetically-optimized bacteria for ammonium release have an improved biofertilization capacity. Some of these strains also cross-feed ammonium into microalgae raising additional concerns on their sustainable use in agriculture due to the potential risk of producing a higher and longer-lasting eutrophication problem than synthetic N-fertilizers. Here we studied the dynamic algal cross-feeding properties of a genetically-modified Azotobacter vinelandii strain which can be tuned to over-accumulate different levels of glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6.3.1.20) under the control of an exogenous inducer. After switching cells overaccumulating GS into a noninducing medium, they proliferated for several generations at the expense of the previously accumulated GS. Further dilution of GS by cell division slowed-down growth, promoted ammonium-excretion and cross-fed algae. The final bacterial population, and timing and magnitude of algal N-biofertlization was finely tuned in a deferred manner. This tuning was in accordance with the intensity of the previous induction of GS accumulation in the cells. This bacterial population behavior could be maintained up to about 15 bacterial cell generations, until faster-growing and nonammonium excreting cells arose at an apparent high frequency. Further improvements of this genetic engineering strategy might help to align efficiency of N-biofertilizers and safe use in an open environment.

Laboratory growth assessments of A. vinelandii are useful for evaluating the impact of environmental and genetic modifications on physiological properties, including diazotrophy.

In this study, the MW and G/M ratio were evaluated in cultures of Azotobacter vinelandii to 3 and 30 L scales at different oxygen transfer rates (OTRs) under diazotrophic conditions. An increase in the maximum OTR (OTRmax) improved the alginate production, reaching 3.3 +/- 0.2 g L(-1). In the cultures conducted to an OTR of 10.4 mmol L(-1) h(-1) (500 rpm), the G/M increased during the cell growth phase and decreased during the stationary phase; whereas, in the cultures at 19.2 mmol L(-1) h(-1) was constant throughout the cultivation. A higher alginate MW (520 +/- 43 kDa) and G/M ratio (0.86 +/- 0.01) were obtained in the cultures conducted at 10.4 mmol L(-1) h(-1). The OTR as a criterion to scale up alginate production allowed to replicate the concentration and the alginate production rate; however, it was not possible reproduce the MW and G/M ratio. Under a similar specific oxygen uptake rate (qO2) (approximately 65 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) the alginate MW was similar (approximately 365 kDa) in both scales. The evidences revealed that the qO2 can be a parameter adequate to produce alginate MW similar in two bioreactor scales.

Recently, photolytic reductive elimination (re) of the E4(4H) hydrides showed that enzymatic re of E4(4H) hydride yields an H2-bound complex (E4(H2,2H)), in a process corresponding to a formal 2-electron reduction of the metal-ion core of FeMo-co. The resulting electron-density redistribution from Fe-H bonds to the metal ions themselves enables N2 to bind with concomitant H2 release, a process illuminated here by QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations. What is the nature of this redistribution? Although E4(H2,2H) has not been trapped, cryogenic photolysis of E4(4H) provides a means to address this question. Photolysis of E4(4H) causes hydride-re with release of H2, generating doubly reduced FeMo-co (denoted E4(2H)*), the extreme limit of the electron-density redistribution upon formation of E4(H2,2H). Here we examine the doubly reduced FeMo-co core of the E4(2H)* limiting-state by (1)H, (57)Fe, and (95)Mo ENDOR to illuminate the partial electron-density redistribution upon E4(H2,2H) formation during catalysis, complementing these results with corresponding DFT computations. Inferences from the E4(2H)* ENDOR results as extended by DFT computations include (i) the Mo-site participates negligibly, and overall it is unlikely that Mo changes valency throughout the catalytic cycle; and (ii) two distinctive E4(4H) (57)Fe signals are suggested as associated with structurally identified ""anchors"" of one bridging hydride, two others with identified anchors of the second, with NBO-analysis further identifying one anchor of each hydride as a major recipient of electrons released upon breaking Fe-H bonds.",1520-5126 (Electronic) 0002-7863 (Linking),2020 Dec 30,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4542-1648', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8186-9450', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8960-6196', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6457-9504', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9118-8480', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3100-0746']",['10.1021/jacs.0c07914 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,,,"['0 (Molybdoferredoxin)', '7YNJ3PO35Z (Hydrogen)', 'EC 1.18.6.1 (Nitrogenase)']","['Animals', 'Azotobacter vinelandii/enzymology', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Electron Transport', 'Hydrogen/*chemistry', 'Molybdoferredoxin/*chemistry', 'Nitrogenase/*chemistry']"

However, the content and composition of alginates differ according to the distinct parts of these macroalgae and have a direct impact on the concentration of guluronate and subsequent commercial value of the final product. The Azotobacter vinelandii mannuronan C-5 epimerases AlgE1 and AlgE4 were used to determine their potential value in tailoring the production of high guluronate low-molecular-weight alginates from two sources of high mannuronic acid alginates, the naturally occurring harvested brown algae (Ascophyllum nodosum, Durvillea potatorum, Laminaria hyperborea and Lessonia nigrescens) and a pure mannuronic acid alginate derived from fermented production of the mutant strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIMB 10,525. The mannuronan C-5 epimerases used in this study increased the content of guluronate from 32% up to 81% in both the harvested seaweed and bacterial fermented alginate sources. The guluronate-rich alginate oligomers subsequently derived from these two different sources showed structural identity as determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR), high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and size-exclusion chromatography with online multi-angle static laser light scattering (SEC-MALS). Functional identity was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays with selected bacteria and antibiotics using the previously documented low-molecular-weight guluronate enriched alginate OligoG CF-5/20 as a comparator. The alginates produced using either source showed similar antibiotic potentiation effects to the drug candidate OligoG CF-5/20 currently in development as a mucolytic and anti-biofilm agent.

They are all two-component enzyme systems, where the catalytic component, referred to as NifDK, VnfDGK, and AnfDGK, associates with the reductase component, the Fe protein or NifH, VnfH, and AnfH respectively. AnfDGK and VnfDGK have an additional subunit compared to NifDK, termed gamma or AnfG and VnfG, whose role is unknown. The expression of each nitrogenase is tightly regulated by metal availability, however it is known that there is crosstalk between the Mo- and Vnitrogenases but the Fenitrogenase components cannot support substrate reduction with its Monitrogenase counterparts. Here, docking models for the nitrogenase complexes were generated in ClusPro 2.0 based on the crystal structure of the Monitrogenase and refined using the HADDOCK 2.2 refinement interface to identify structural determinants that enable crosstalk between the Mo- and Vnitrogenase but not the Fenitrogenase. Differing salt bridge interactions were identified at the binding interface of each complex. Specifically, positively charged residues of VnfG enable complementary interactions with NifH and VnfH but not AnfH. Similarly, negatively charged residues of AnfG enable interactions with AnfH but not NifH or VnfH. A role for the G subunit is revealed where VnfG could be mediating crosstalk between the Mo- and Vnitrogenases while the AnfG subunit on AnfDGK makes interactions with NifH and VnfH unfavorable, reducing competition with NifDK and funneling electrons to the most efficient nitrogenase.",1873-3344 (Electronic) 0162-0134 (Linking),2021 Jan,,"['S0162-0134(20)30301-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2020.111273 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['Differential gene expression', 'Electron transfer', 'Homology modeling', 'Nitrogenase', 'Protein-protein interaction', 'Transcriptomics']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Although this developmental process has served as a model for the study of cell differentiation in Gram-negative bacteria, the molecular basis of its regulation is still poorly understood. Here, we report that the ubiquitous second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) is critical for the formation of cysts in Azotobacter vinelandii Upon encystment induction, the levels of c-di-GMP increased, reaching a peak within the first 6 h. In the absence of the diguanylate cyclase MucR, however, the levels of this second messenger remained low throughout the developmental process. A. vinelandii cysts are surrounded by two alginate layers with variable proportions of guluronic residues, which are introduced into the final alginate chain by extracellular mannuronic C-5 epimerases of the AlgE1 to AlgE7 family. Unlike in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MucR was not required for alginate polymerization in A. vinelandii Conversely, MucR was necessary for the expression of extracellular alginate C-5 epimerases; therefore, the MucR-deficient strain produced cyst-like structures devoid of the alginate capsule and unable to resist desiccation. Expression of mucR was partially dependent on the response regulator AlgR, which binds to two sites in the mucR promoter, enhancing mucR transcription. Together, these results indicate that the developmental process of A. vinelandii is controlled through a signaling module that involves activation by the response regulator AlgR and c-di-GMP accumulation that depends on MucR.IMPORTANCE A. vinelandii has served as an experimental model for the study of the differentiation processes to form metabolically dormant cells in Gram-negative bacteria. This work identifies c-di-GMP as a critical regulator for the production of alginates with specific contents of guluronic residues that are able to structure the rigid laminated layers of the cyst envelope. Although allosteric activation of the alginate polymerase complex Alg8-Alg44 by c-di-GMP has long been recognized, our results show a previously unidentified role during the polymer modification step, controlling the expression of extracellular alginate epimerases. Our results also highlight the importance of c-di-GMP in the control of the physical properties of alginate, which ultimately determine the desiccation resistance of the differentiated cell.",1098-5530 (Electronic) 0021-9193 (Linking),2020 Nov 19,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1807-3836'],"['JB.00135-20 [pii]', '10.1128/JB.00135-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['*Azotobacter vinelandii', '*MucR', '*alginate', '*c-di-GMP', '*cyst capsule', '*encystment', '*mannuronan C-5 epimerases']",['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['0 (Alginates)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', ""61093-23-0 (bis(3',5')-cyclic diguanylic acid)"", 'EC 4.6.- (Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.6.1.- (diguanylate cyclase)', 'EC 5.1.3.- (Carbohydrate Epimerases)', 'EC 5.1.3.- (mannuronan c-5-epimerase)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']","['Alginates/metabolism', 'Azotobacter vinelandii/*enzymology/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carbohydrate Epimerases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases/genetics/metabolism', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/enzymology/genetics/metabolism']"

We surveyed multiple sites and habitats (woodland, grassland, coastal chaparral) in California to describe spatial patterns of tick-borne pathogen prevalence in western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). We found that several species of Borrelia - B. burgdorferi , B. americana and B. bissettiae - were observed in habitats such as coastal chaparral that does not harbor obvious reservoir host candidates. Describing tick-borne pathogen prevalence is strongly influenced by the scale of surveillance: aggregating data from individual sites to match jurisdictional boundaries (e.g., county or state) can lower the reported infection prevalence. Considering multiple pathogen species in the same habitat allows a more cohesive interpretation of local pathogen occurrence.ImportanceUnderstanding the local host ecology and prevalence of zoonotic diseases is vital for public health. Using tick-borne diseases in California, we show that there is often a bias to our understanding and that studies tend to focus on particular habitats e.g., Lyme disease in oak woodlands. Other habitats may harbor a surprising diversity of tick-borne pathogens but have been neglected, e.g., coastal chaparral.

Little information exists regarding the prevalence and the role of various factors affecting the occurrence of anaplasmosis in the west of Iran. The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with Anaplasma pathogens in Kurdistan province, west of Iran. During spring and summer 2016, blood samples were collected from a total of 401 livestock animals from different farms distributed in the Kurdistan province. Furthermore, data on general husbandry traits and management practices were recorded. PCR examination showed an overall prevalence of 37.3 and 10% in cattle and sheep, respectively. Cattle were infected with A. phagocytophilum (23.8%), A. bovis (15.4%), and A. marginale (13.9%) while sheep were infected with A. ovis (10%) and A. phagocytophilum (3.5%). The occurrence of anaplasmosis was considerably higher in cattle compared to sheep (P < 0.0001). Based on results of logistic regression models, risk of Anaplasma infection was significantly higher in crossbreeds (odds ratio (OR) = 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.025-3.65, P = 0.042) compared with local cattle breeds. Furthermore, being older than 1 year was associated with increased risk of Anaplasma infection in cattle (OR = 2.18, 95%, CI = 1.022-4.68, P = 0.044) and sheep (OR = 2.86, 95%, CI = 1.006-8.22, P = 0.049) compared to younger individuals.

Many previously published studies on tick-borne pathogens focused on those transmitted by ixodid ticks. Although there are increasing reports of viral pathogens associated with argasid ticks, information on bacterial pathogens they transmit is scarce. The aim of this molecular study was to detect and characterize Rickettsia and Anaplasmataceae in three different argasid tick species, Ornithodoros faini, Ornithodoros moubata, and Argas walkerae collected in Zambia. Rickettsia hoogstraalii and Rickettsia lusitaniae were detected in 77 % (77/100) of Ar. walkerae and 10 % (5/50) of O. faini, respectively. All O. moubata pool samples (n = 124) were negative for rickettsial infections. Anaplasmataceae were detected in 63 % (63/100) of Ar. walkerae and in 82.2 % (102/124) of O. moubata pools, but not in O. faini. Phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated sequences of 16S rRNA and groEL genes revealed that Anaplasma spp. detected in the present study were distinct from previously validated Anaplasma species, indicating that the current knowledge on the diversity and vector range of Anaplasma spp. is incomplete.

Similarly, Ehrlichia canis is another tick-borne rickettsial pathogen responsible for canine monocytic ehrlichiosis and is also reported to cause infections in people. We describe infections in dogs with these two pathogens on the Caribbean island of Grenada, West Indies by detection using molecular methods. We utilized a 16S rRNA gene-based PCR assay to detect both Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species by screening 155 canine blood samples from asymptomatic dogs.

The large-scale production of HMOs has been researched using engineered microbial routes due to the availability, safety, and low cost of host strains. In addition, the development of molecular biology technology and metabolic engineering has promoted the effectiveness of HMOs production.

However, due to the uncertainty of metabolic patterns, the selection of host strains has certain limitations. Aside from that, the expression of appropriate glycosyltransferase in microbes is key to the synthesis of different HMOs. Therefore, finding a safe and efficient glycosyltransferase has to be addressed when using engineered microbial pathways.

Despite their abundance, the landscape of S-layer structure and function remains a land of wonder. By virtue of their location, bacterial S-layers have been hypothesized to add structural stability to the cell envelope. In addition, S-layers are implicated in mediating cell-environment and cell-host interactions playing a key role in adhesion, cell growth, and division. Significant strides in the understanding of these bacterial cell envelope components were made possible by recent studies that have provided structural and functional insights on the critical S-layer and S-layer-associated proteins (SLPs and SLAPs), highlighting their roles in pathogenicity and their potential as therapeutic or vaccine targets. In this mini-review, we revisit the sequence-structure-function relationships of S-layers, SLPs, and SLAPs in Gram-positive pathogens, focusing on the best-studied classes, Bacilli (Bacillus anthracis) and Clostridia (Clostridioides difficile). We delineate the domains and their architectures in archetypal S-layer proteins across Gram-positive genera and reconcile them with experimental findings. Similarly, we highlight a few key ""flavors"" of SLPs displayed by Gram-positive pathogens to assemble and support the bacterial S-layers.

It mediates the interactions of spores with their environment, modulates spore adhesion and germination, and has been implicated in pathogenesis. In Bacillus cereus, the exosporium consists of a crystalline basal layer, formed mainly by the two cysteine-rich proteins CotY and ExsY, surrounded by a hairy nap composed of glycoproteins. The morphogenetic protein CotE is necessary for the integrity of the B. cereus exosporium, but how CotE directs exosporium assembly remains unknown. Here, we used super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to follow the localization of SNAP-tagged CotE, CotY, and ExsY during B. cereus sporulation and evidenced the interdependencies among these proteins. Complexes of CotE, CotY, and ExsY are present at all sporulation stages, and the three proteins follow similar localization patterns during endospore formation that are reminiscent of the localization pattern of Bacillus subtilis CotE. We show that B. cereus CotE guides the formation of one cap at both forespore poles by positioning CotY and then guides forespore encasement by ExsY, thereby promoting exosporium elongation. By these two actions, CotE ensures the formation of a complete exosporium. Importantly, we demonstrate that the assembly of the exosporium is not a unidirectional process, as previously proposed, but occurs through the formation of two caps, as observed during B. subtilis coat morphogenesis, suggesting that a general principle governs the assembly of the spore surface layers of Bacillaceae IMPORTANCE Spores of Bacillaceae are enveloped in an outermost glycoprotein layer. In the B. cereus group, encompassing the Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus pathogens, this layer is easily recognizable by a characteristic balloon-like appearance and separation from the underlying coat by an interspace. In spite of its importance for the environmental interactions of spores, including those with host cells, the mechanism of assembly of the exosporium is poorly understood. We used super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize the formation of the exosporium during the sporulation of B. cereus, and we studied the localization and interdependencies of proteins essential for exosporium morphogenesis. We discovered that these proteins form a morphogenetic scaffold before a complete exosporium or coat is detectable. We describe how the different proteins localize to the scaffold and how they subsequently assemble around the spore, and we present a model for the assembly of the exosporium.",2379-5042 (Electronic) 2379-5042 (Linking),2021 Apr 21,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9840-4262'],"['6/2/e00007-21 [pii]', '10.1128/mSphere.00007-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['SR-SIM', 'endospores', 'exosporium', 'morphogenetic proteins', 'spore']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Lablaine et al.'],,

Core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) is a bacterial subtyping method that uses WGS data to provide a high resolution strain characterisation. This study aimed at developing a novel cgMLST scheme for Bacillus anthracis, a notorious pathogen that causes anthrax in livestock and humans worldwide. The scheme comprises 3,803 genes that were conserved in 57 B. anthracis genomes spanning the whole phylogeny. The scheme has been evaluated and applied to 584 genomes from 50 countries. On average, 99.5% of the cgMLST targets were detected. The cgMLST results confirmed the classical canonical Single-Nucleotide-Polymorphisms (SNPs) grouping of B. anthracis into major clades and subclades. Genetic distances calculated based on cgMLST were comparable to distances from whole-genome-based SNP analysis with similar phylogenetic topology and comparable discriminatory power. Additionally, the application of the cgMLST scheme to anthrax outbreaks from Germany and Italy led to a definition of a cut-off threshold of five allele differences to trace epidemiologically linked strains for cluster typing and transmission analysis. Finally, the association of two clusters of B. anthracis to human cases of injectional anthrax in four European countries was confirmed using cgMLST. In summary, this study presents a novel cgMLST scheme that provides a high-resolution strain genotyping for B. anthracis This scheme can be used in parallel with SNP typing methods to facilitate rapid and harmonised inter-laboratory comparisons, essential for global surveillance and outbreak analysis.

The presence of this gene in the sulfate and thiosulfate-reducing Archaeoglobus fulgidus DSM 4304 and other hyperthermophilic Archaeoglobales appears anomalous, as A. fulgidus is unable to respire S(0) and grow in the presence of elemental sulfur. To assess the role of Npsr in the sulfur metabolism of A. fulgidus DSM 4304, the Npsr from A. fulgidus was characterized. AfNpsr is specific for persulfide and polysulfide as substrates in the oxidative half-reaction, exhibiting k cat/K m on the order of 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), which is similar to the kinetic parameters observed for hyperthermophilic CoA persulfide reductases. In contrast to the bacterial Npsr, AfNpsr exhibits low disulfide reductase activity with DTNB; however, similar to the bacterial enzymes, it does not show detectable activity with CoA-disulfide, oxidized glutathione, or cystine. The 3.1 A X-ray structure of AfNpsr reveals access to the tightly bound catalytic CoA, and the active site Cys 42 is restricted by a flexible loop (residues 60-66) that is not seen in the bacterial homologs from Shewanella loihica PV-4 and Bacillus anthracis. Unlike the bacterial enzymes, AfNpsr exhibits NADH oxidase activity and also shows no detectable activity with NADPH. Models suggest steric and electrostatic repulsions of the NADPH 2'-phosphate account for the strong preference for NADH. The presence of Npsr in the nonsulfur-reducing A. fulgidus suggests that the enzyme may offer some protection against S(0) or serve in another metabolic role that has yet to be identified.",1472-3654 (Electronic) 1472-3646 (Linking),2021,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8575-0422', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7550-5116']",['10.1155/2021/8817136 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Sherwin Shabdar et al.'],,

Resistance to beta-lactams complicates the treatment of bacterial infections. In recent years, the spread of beta-lactam resistance has increased with growing intensity. Resistance is often conferred by beta-lactamases, which inactivate beta-lactams, or the expression of alternative beta-lactam-resistant PBPs. sigma(P) is an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor that controls beta-lactam resistance in the species Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus anthracis sigma(P) is normally held inactive by the anti-sigma factor RsiP. sigma(P) is activated by beta-lactams that trigger the proteolytic destruction of RsiP. Here, we identify the penicillin-binding protein PbpP and demonstrate its essential role in the activation of sigma(P) Our data show that PbpP is required for sigma(P) activation and RsiP degradation. Our data suggest that PbpP acts as a beta-lactam sensor since the binding of a subset of beta-lactams to PbpP is required for sigma(P) activation. We find that PbpP likely directly or indirectly controls site 1 cleavage of RsiP, which results in the degradation of RsiP and, thus, sigma(P) activation. sigma(P) activation results in increased expression of beta-lactamases and, thus, increased beta-lactam resistance. This work is the first report of a PBP acting as a sensor for beta-lactams and controlling the activation of an ECF sigma factor.IMPORTANCE The bacterial cell envelope is the target for numerous antibiotics. Many antibiotics target the synthesis of peptidoglycan, which is a central metabolic pathway essential for bacterial survival. One of the most important classes of antibiotics has been beta-lactams, which inhibit the transpeptidase activity of penicillin-binding proteins to decrease the cross-linking of peptidoglycan and the strength of the cell wall. While beta-lactam antibiotics have historically proven to be effective, resistance to beta-lactams is a growing problem. The ECF sigma factor sigma(P) is required for beta-lactam resistance in B. thuringiensis and close relatives, including B. anthracis Here, we provide insight into the mechanism of activation of sigma(P) by beta-lactams.",2150-7511 (Electronic),2021 Mar 23,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8953-5081'],"['mBio.00179-21 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00179-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['*cell envelope', '*regulation of gene expression', '*sigma factors', '*signal transduction', '*stress response', '*sigma factors']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Nauta et al.'],,

In vitro, prkC disruption strain (BAS DeltaprkC) grew as shorter chains throughout the bacterial growth cycle. A comparative analysis between the parent strain and BAS DeltaprkC indicated that the levels of proteins, BslO and Sap, associated with the regulation of the bacterial chain length, were upregulated in BAS DeltaprkC BslO is a septal murein hydrolase that catalyzes daughter cell separation and Sap is an S-layer structural protein required for the septal localization of BslO. PrkC disruption also has a significant effect on bacterial growth, cell wall thickness, and septa formation. Upregulation of ftsZ in BAS DeltaprkC was also observed.

B. anthracis is a pathogenic bacterium that is potentially to be used in bioterrorism because it can be produced in the form of spores. Currently, protective antigen (PA)-based vaccines are being used for the prevention of anthrax, but it is necessary to develop more safe and effective vaccines due to their prolonged immunization schedules and adverse reactions. METHODS: We selected the lipoprotein GBAA0190, a potent inducer of host immune response, present in anthrax spores as a novel potential vaccine candidate. Then, we evaluated its immune-stimulating activity in the bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis. Protective efficacy of GBAA0190 was evaluated in the guinea pig (GP) model. RESULTS: The recombinant GBAA0190 (r0190) protein induced the expression of various inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) in the BMDMs. These immune responses were mediated through toll-like receptor 1/2 via activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways. We demonstrated that not only immunization of r0190 alone, but also combined immunization with r0190 and recombinant PA showed significant protective efficacy against B. anthracis spore challenges in the GP model.

To investigate the promoting effect of YeaZ on the isolation of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) bacteria from soil samples in extreme environments, the recombinant YeaZ of Vibrio harveyi was prepared and added to the soil samples from volcanic soil and saline soil in Northwest China. The study has shown that YeaZ can promote the recovery and growth of soil microorganisms, and the number of cultivable bacteria in volcanic and saline soil has increased from 0.17 x 10(3) and 2.03 x 10(3) cfuml(-1) to 1.00 x 10(3) and 5.55 x 10(3) cfuml(-1), respectively. The 16S rDNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that YeaZ played an essential role in the increase of composition and diversity of bacteria. A total of 13 bacterial strains were isolated from the volcanic soil samples, which belong to phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Gamma-proteobacteria.

However, a mechanistic understanding of how Levilactobacillus brevis cooperates with S. thermophilus to stimulate GABA production has been lacking. Comparative peptidomic and metatranscriptomic analyses were carried out to unravel the casein and lactose utilization patterns during milk fermentation with the coculture. We found that particular peptides hydrolyzed by S. thermophilus ASCC1275 were transported and biodegraded with peptidase in Lb. brevis 145 to meet the growth needs of the latter. In addition, amino acid synthesis and metabolism in Lb. brevis 145 were activated to further support its growth. Glucose, as a result of lactose hydrolysis by S. thermophilus 1275, but not available lactose in milk, was metabolized as the main carbon source by Lb. brevis 145 for ATP production. In the stationary phase, under acidic conditions due to the accumulation of lactic acid produced by S. thermophilus 1275, the expression of genes involved in pyridoxal phosphate (coenzyme of glutamic acid decarboxylase) metabolism and glutamic acid decarboxylase (Gad) in Lb. brevis 145 was induced for GABA production.SIGNIFICANCE A huge market for GABA-rich milk as a dietary therapy for the management of hypertension is anticipated. The novelty of this work lies in applying peptide profiles supported by metatranscriptomics to elucidate (i) the pattern of casein hydrolysis by S. thermophilus 1275, (ii) the supply of peptides and glucose by S. thermophilus 1275 to Lb. brevis 145, (iii) the transportation of peptides in Lb. brevis and the degradation of peptides by this organism, which was reported to be nonproteolytic, and (iv) GABA production by Lb. brevis 145 under acidic conditions.

Contamination sources and concomitant remedies are numerous and challenging to manage. We herein describe two cases of uncommon contamination of cell cultures that we encountered, and the successful determination and eradication strategies. The first case describes the infection with human adenovirus C that originated from pharyngeal tonsils used for isolation of primary tonsillar epithelial cells. It is known that viral contamination of in vitro cell cultures can occur symptomless and is therefore difficult to identify. The contamination was pervasive and persistent, as it was widely spread in flow cabinets and apparatus, and has caused a serious delay to our research projects and the inevitable loss of valuable (patient-derived) cell sources. Eradication was successful by formalin gas sterilization of the flow cabinet and elimination of all infected cell lines from our biobank after PCR-guided determination. Secondly, we encountered a spore-forming bacterium, namely Brevibacillus brevis, in our cell culture facility.

The GZDF3 strain produces certain active compounds, such as siderophores, which are the final metabolite products of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and independent non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NIS) activity. With the present study, we attempted to investigate the siderophore production characteristics and conditions of Bacillus sp. GZDF3. The antibacterial activity of the siderophores on pathogenic fungi was also investigated. Optimal conditions for the synthesis of siderophores were determined by single factor method, using sucrose 15 g/l, asparagine 2 g/l, 32 degrees C, and 48 h. The optimized sucrose asparagine medium significantly increased the production of siderophores, from 27.09% to 54.99%. Moreover, the effects of different kinds of metal ions on siderophore production were explored here. We found that Fe(3+) and Cu(2+) significantly inhibited the synthesis of siderophores. The preliminary separation and purification of siderophores by immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) provides strong antibacterial activity against Candida albicans. The synergistic effect of siderophores and amphotericin B was also demonstrated.

By using combined metabolomic and proteomic approaches, we demonstrated that QS modulates the production of antimicrobial and toxic compounds in C. violaceum ATCC 12472. We provided the first evidence of anisomycin antibiotic production by this strain as well as evidence of its regulation by QS and identified new AHLs produced by C. violaceum ATCC 12472. Furthermore, we demonstrated that targeting AHLs with lactonase leads to major QS disruption yielding significant molecular and phenotypic changes. These modifications resulted in drastic changes in social interactions between C. violaceum and a Gram-positive bacterium (Bacillus cereus), a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), immune cells (murine macrophages), and an animal model (planarian Schmidtea mediterranea).

In this study, the surfactants and other additives were investigated as biocidal or bacteriostatic against B. subtilis, and the viability of B. subtilis was examined at different pH ranges for microbial cleaner formulation. As a result, it was discovered that the B. subtilis, which can be used in the microbial cleaner formulation, shows higher growth and viability at the neutral pH, and it passes into the death phase at pH 3. According to antagonistic activity results, the Gram-positive S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were the most sensitive bacteria while B. cereus was the most resistant bacteria. The anionic surfactants such as linear alkylbenzene sulfonic acid and sodium lauryl ether sulfate act as bacteriostatic on Bacillus spp. and do not cause cell death.

This study evaluated the efficacy of ozonated water on the inactivation of viruses, bacteria, and viruses in association with bacteria on produce surfaces. Boston bibb lettuce (BB) and cherry tomatoes were spot inoculated with viruses (murine norovirus (MNV) and MS2 bacteriophage), bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae and Bacillus cereus), or MNV associated with E. cloacae or B. cereus. Following inoculation, produce was held at 4 degrees C for 90 min (virus, virus + bacteria) or 24 h (virus, bacteria) prior to treatment. A batch wash ozone sanitation system (BWOSS) was prepared with ice (3-5 degrees C) and 0.5 ppm initial ozone concentration or no ozone. Produce samples were treated for 40 min with an ozonated water (0.86-0.99 ppm) or water-only wash with samples taken every 10 min. Samples were processed for microbial recovery, and plaque forming units (PFU) and colony forming units remaining on the produce were determined. Although microbial reductions of 99 to 99.99% were achieved during ozone treatments, few statistically significant differences (P > 0.1) were detected when comparing the ozonated water to water-only wash. Notably, a significant difference (P = 0.009) in log reduction of MNV + bacteria and MNV alone on BB was observed after 40 min ozonated water wash. Specifically, MNV with B. cereus achieved a 1-log greater reduction (2.60 log PFU/ml) compared to MNV alone (1.63 log PFU/ml). Overall, washing produce in ozonated water did not significantly increase microbial inactivation compared to water alone under the conditions presented here.

Around 60% of the antibiotics used today were obtained from the genus Streptomyces. The river sediments of Bangladesh are still an unexplored source for antibiotic-producing bacteria (APB). This study aimed to isolate novel APB from Padma and Kapotakkho river sediments having the potential to produce antibacterial compounds with known scaffolds by manipulating their self-protection mechanisms. RESULTS: The antibiotic supplemented starch-casein-nitrate agar (SCNA) media were used to isolate antibiotic-resistant APB from the river sediments. The colonies having Streptomyces-like morphology were selectively purified and their antagonistic activity was screened against a range of test bacteria using the cross-streaking method. A notable decrease of the colony-forming units (CFUs) in the antibiotic supplemented SCNA plates compared to control plates (where added antibiotics were absent) was observed. A total of three azithromycin resistant (AZR) and nine meropenem resistant (MPR) isolates were purified and their antagonistic activity was investigated against a series of test bacteria including Shigella brodie, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Proteus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. All the AZR isolates and all but two MPR isolates exhibited moderate to high broad-spectrum activity. Among the isolates, 16S rDNA sequencing of NAr5 and NAr6 were performed to identify them up to species level. The analyses of the sequences revealed that both belong to the genus Streptomyces.

In particular, nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) have an enormous antimicrobial potential by causing cell lysis, perforation of fungal membranes, enzyme inhibition, or disruption of bacterial protein synthesis. This knowledge was primarily acquired in vitro when B. subtilis was competing with other microbial monocultures. However, our understanding of the true ecological role of these small molecules is limited. In this study, we have established soil-derived semisynthetic mock communities containing 13 main genera and supplemented them with B. subtilis P5_B1 WT, the NRP-deficient strain sfp, or single-NRP mutants incapable of producing surfactin, plipastatin, or bacillaene. Through 16S amplicon sequencing, it was revealed that the invasion of NRP-producing B. subtilis strains had no major impact on the bacterial communities.

These bacteria were identified as Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Bacillus aryabhattai, and Microbacterium oxydans. Their ability to biodegrade LDPE was assessed by growth curves, cell biomass production, polyethylene (PE) weight loss, and the presence of LDPE hydrolysis products in the growth media. Consortia of these bacteria with three other bacteria previously shown to degrade LDPE (Cupriavidus necator H16, Pseudomonas putida LS46, and Pseudomonas putida IRN22) were also tested. Growth curves of the bacteria utilizing LDPE as a sole carbon source revealed a peak in cell density after 24 h. Cell densities declined by 48 h but slowly increased again to different extents, depending on the bacteria. Incubation of LDPE with bacteria isolated from greater wax moth larvae had significant effects on bacterial cell mass production and weight loss of LDPE in PE-containing media.

Different batches of raw milk from 69 dairy farms divided into sets in 3 bulk tanks (A, B, C) were evaluated at different times during the technological process. As the raw milk was preheated ( approximately 55 degrees C) immediately before bactofugation (10,000 x g), the effect of bactofugation was estimated by comparing the counts in raw, preheated, and bactofuged milk. This centrifugation was sufficient to reduce the isolation of 88% of the MT in preheated milk. For PT, it was possible to verify a reduction of 72.5% in batch C. The TT were not recovered at higher detection limits (<5 cfu/mL). For diversity, 310 isolates were identified using a molecular approach; 15 species of contaminating thermoduric bacteria were identified from raw and preheated milk, and only 6 species were recovered in bactofuged milk. Only MT were recovered from the bactofuged milk, mainly the species Lysinibacillus fusiformis (61.7%) and Bacillus licheniformis (12.3%). Both species are known to be endospore-forming psychrotrophs and have proteolytic or lipolytic activity. The bactofugation of raw milk reduced the number of isolates of B. licheniformis, Bacillus toyonensis, Micrococcus aloeverae, and Aestuariimicrobium kwangyangense by 33, 43, 86, and 92%, respectively, and reduced the isolates of Macrococcus caseolyticus, Lysinibacillus varians, Carnobacterium divergens, Microbacterium hominis, Kocuria indica, Micrococcus yunnanensis, Gordonia paraffinivorans, Bacillus invictae, and Kocuria kristinae to undetectable levels.

The diversity of microbial communities in sour rot-affected grapes depends on the cultivation site, but the microbes responsible for this disease in eastern coastal China, has not been reported. To identify the microbes that cause sour grape rot in this important grape-producing region, the diversity and abundance of bacteria and fungi were assessed by metagenomic analysis and cultivation-dependent techniques. A total of 15 bacteria and 10 fungi were isolated from sour rot-affected grapes.

Different biofertilizers were applied to maize. The physical and chemical properties of rhizosphere soil samples were analyzed and the rhizosphere bacteria were analyzed by 16S amplicon sequencing. The results showed that treatment with Bacillus licheniformis and B. amyloliquefaciens as biofertilizers increased the soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) contents, indicating that the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in the biofertilizers might help the host plant to produce root exudates that, in return, recruit beneficial communities due to available sugars, amino acids, organic acids, vitamins, and polymers. The rhizosphere of maize treated with B. subtilis biofertilizer had the highest diversity and richness. However, the rhizosphere treated with the combined bacterial strains had the lowest diversity and richness, which might be due to the directional increase of the abundance of some bacteria with special functions, but the decrease of the overall bacterial community diversity in the soil. The dominant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria (32.2%-34.6%), Acidobacteria (15.0%-21.0%), Actinobacteria (13.1%-17.2%), and Gemmatimonadetes (9.0%-10.8%), and the dominant bacterial species were Aciditerrimonas ferrireducens JCM 15389 (4.3%-5.2%), Gemmatimonas aurantiaca (3.2%-4.1%), and Pyrinomonas methylaliphatogenes (2.1%-4.8%). The significantly enriched bacterial functions were associated with amino acid metabolism, sugar metabolism, and energy metabolism pathways. The results of a redundancy analysis showed that SOM, TP, and AK were the main factors affecting the microbial community structure in the maize rhizosphere.

Probiotics can regulate the gut microbiota by inhibiting the colonization of harmful bacteria and promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacteria. Here, we investigated the preventive effects of a probiotic Bacillus licheniformis strain (BL, CMCC 63516) on HS rats as well as its effects on intestinal barrier function and gut microbiota. All rats were randomly divided into four groups: control (Con) + PBS (pre-administration with 1 ml PBS twice a day for 7 days, without HS induction), Con + BL group (pre-administration with 1 ml 1 x 10(8) CFU/ml BL twice a day for 7 days, without HS induction), HS + PBS (PBS, with HS induction), and HS + BL (BL, with HS induction). Before the study, the BL strain was identified by genomic DNA analysis. Experimental HS was induced by placing rats in a hot and humid chamber for 60 min until meeting the diagnostic criterion of HS onset. Body weight, core body temperature, survival rate, biochemical markers, inflammatory cytokines, and histopathology were investigated to evaluate the preventive effects of BL on HS. D-Lactate, I-FABP, endotoxin, and tight-junction proteins were investigated, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4) test administered, to assess the degree of intestinal injury and integrity. Gut microbiota of rats in each group were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The results showed that pre-administration with BL significantly attenuated hyperthermia, reduced HS-induced death, alleviated multiple-organ injury, and decreased the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, BL sustained the intestinal barrier integrity of HS rats by alleviating intestinal injury and improving tight junctions. We also found that BL significantly increased the ratios of two probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus. In addition, Romboutsia, a candidate biomarker for HS diagnosis, was unexpectedly detected. In summary, BL pre-administration for 7 days has preventative effects on HS that may be mediated by sustaining intestinal barrier function and modulating gut microbiota.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fmicb.2021.630841 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['16S rRNA', 'Bacillus licheniformis', 'gut microbiota', 'heat stroke', 'intestinal barrier', 'probiotics']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Wang, Chen, Xu, Wang, Xia, Liu, Wang, Xie, Wu, Li, Zhang,', 'Wang, Zhu, Ling and Xu.']",,

To search for potential agents for the interruption of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike glycoprotein 1 (S1) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor interactions, the in silico antiviral prospective of peptides identified from the proteome of kinema was investigated. Soybean was fermented using Bacillus licheniformis KN1G, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens KN2G and two different strains of Bacillus subtilis (KN2B and KN2M). The peptides were screened in silico for possible antiviral activity using two different web servers (AVPpred and meta-iAVP), and binding interactions of selected 44 peptides were further explored against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein (PDB ID: 6M0J) by molecular docking using ZDOCK. The results showed that a peptide ALPEEVIQHTFNLKSQ (P13) belonging to B. licheniformis KN1G fermented kinema was able to make contacts with the binding motif of RBD by blocking specific residues designated as critical (GLN493, ASN501) in the binding of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor. The selected peptide was also observed to have a significant affinity towards human toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)/Myeloid Differentiation factor 2 (MD2) (PDB ID: 3FXI) complex known for its essential role in cytokine storm. The energy properties of the docked complexes were analyzed through the Generalized Born model and Solvent Accessibility method (MM/GBSA) using HawkDock server.

The findings of the study suggest that the peptides from fermented soy prepared using B. licheniformis KN1G have better potential to be used as antiviral agents. The specific peptide ALPEEVIQHTFNLKSQ could be synthesized and used in combination with experimental studies to validate its effect on SARS-CoV-2-hACE2 interaction and modulation of TLR4 activity.

Their infectivity co-appears with PrP(Sc), aberrant depositions of the host's cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). Successive heat treatment in the presence of detergent and proteolysis by a keratinase from Bacillus licheniformis PWD-1 was shown before to destroy PrP(Sc) from bovine TSE (BSE) and sheep scrapie diseased brain, however data regarding expected reduction of infectivity were still lacking. Therefore, transgenic Tgbov XV mice which are highly BSE susceptible were used to quantify infectivity before and after the bovine brain treatment procedure. Also four immunochemical analyses were applied to compare the levels of PrP(Sc). After heating at 115 degrees C with or without subsequent proteolysis, the original BSE infectivity of 10(6.2-6.4) ID50 g(-1) was reduced to a remaining infectivity of 10(4.6-5.7) ID50 g(-1) while strain characteristics were unaltered, even after precipitation with methanol. Surprisingly, PrP(Sc) depletion was 5-800 times higher than the loss of infectivity. Similar treatment was applied on other prion strains, which were CWD1 in bank voles, 263 K scrapie in hamsters and sheep PG127 scrapie in tg338 ovinized mice. In these strains however, infectivity was already destroyed by heat only. These findings show the unusual heat resistance of BSE and support a role for an additional factor in prion formation as suggested elsewhere when producing prions from PrP(C). Leftover material in the remaining PrP(Sc) depleted BSE preparation offers a unique substrate for searching additional elements for prion infectivity and improving our concept about the nature of prions.",1297-9716 (Electronic) 0928-4249 (Linking),2021 Apr 16,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4165-3230'],"['10.1186/s13567-021-00928-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13567-021-00928-8 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['BSE', 'Bioassay', 'Heat', 'Inactivation', 'Infectivity', 'Molecular mechanism', 'PrP', 'Prion', 'Strain', 'Zoonotic']",,,

Materials and Methods: Enzimsporin was fed to lambs and sheep at different doses to determine the bacteria's probiotic effects. Sheep were divided into three groups (six each), which received 0, 1, and 3 gm of Enzimsporin/per head/day, respectively, and two groups of lambs (10 each), who received 0 gm and 1 gm of Enzimsporin/per head/day for 30 days in addition to their regular ration. On day 30, blood samples were collected, followed by the determination of biochemical, hematological, and natural resistance indicators. Fecal samples were examined to determine the intestinal microflora, and animals were weighed daily to determine their growth dynamics. Results: Supplementation of probiotics (Enzimsporin(TM)) improved the lambs' body weight gain by 18.8%. Analysis of the clinical parameters showed improvements in the levels of total protein, globulins, and urea by 5.3%, 10.8%, and 6.2%, respectively, in the blood of probiotic-supplemented lambs. Similarly, an increment in the total protein, albumins, and globulins was observed in the sheep with Enzimsporin(TM) supplementation. The decrease in bilirubin and cholesterol levels in the blood and increased bactericidal and phagocytic index in the sheep and lambs with probiotic supplementation indicated a positive influence of Enzimsporin(TM) on the liver function and natural resistance. Furthermore, an increase in Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and a decrease in the Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Yeast in the fecal contents of experimental sheep and lambs indicated the potentiality of Enzimsporin(TM) on maintaining good gut health.

However, the influence of potassium (K) solubilizing bacteria (KSB) originating from saxicolous habitat (rock-dwelling) on plant growth has not been frequently examined. In this study, we isolated KSB from saxicolous habitats and estimated their ability to produce plant growth hormone, organic acids, and siderophore that may facilitate plant growth. Fifteen culturable saxicolous bacterial isolates with varied K solubilizing ability were isolated from two sites. Of these, four potential K solubilizers were selected and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The four bacterial isolates resembled Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, and Burkholderia cenocepacia and produced different organic acids, indole acetic acid, and siderophore under in vitro conditions. Potassium solubilization differed among the bacterial isolates and was significantly influenced by K sources. Inoculation of KSB improved the tomato plant growth parameters like plant height, leaf area, total root length, root/shoot ratio, and tissue K content in sterilized and unsterilized Alfisol, and Vertisol soils under greenhouse conditions. We also observed higher residual K content in the KSB inoculated post-harvest soils. Among the four KSB isolates screened, B. licheniformis and B. cenocepacia presents an excellent prospect as bio-inoculants for improving tomato growth in different soil types. Besides these, the enriched K content in the post-harvest soils may help the growth of subsequent crops in sustainable agriculture.",1432-072X (Electronic) 0302-8933 (Linking),2021 Apr 5,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1274-9038', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0060-0079']","['10.1007/s00203-021-02284-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00203-021-02284-9 [pii]']",['eng'],Germany,"['Bacillus licheniformis', 'Bio-fertilizer', 'Indole acetic acid', 'Organic acid', 'Siderophore']",,,

There is great interest in the development of improved chitinases to address the environmental burden of chitin waste from the food processing industry as well as the potential medical, agricultural, and industrial uses of partially deacetylated chitin (chitosan) and its products (chito-oligosaccharides). The depolymerization of chitin can be achieved using chemical and physical treatments, but an enzymatic process would be more environmentally friendly and more sustainable. However, chitinases are slow-acting enzymes, limiting their biotechnological exploitation, although this can be overcome by molecular evolution approaches to enhance the features required for specific applications. The two main goals of this study were the development of a high-throughput screening system for chitinase activity (which could be extrapolated to other hydrolytic enzymes), and the deployment of this new method to select improved chitinase variants. We therefore cloned and expressed the Bacillus licheniformis DSM8785 chitinase A (chiA) gene in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and generated a mutant library by error-prone PCR. We then developed a screening method based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using the model substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-d-N,N',N''-triacetyl chitotrioside to identify improved enzymes. We prevented cross-talk between emulsion compartments caused by the hydrophobicity of 4-methylumbelliferone, the fluorescent product of the enzymatic reaction, by incorporating cyclodextrins into the aqueous phases. We also addressed the toxicity of long-term chiA expression in E. coli by limiting the reaction time.

The aim of this study was to isolate the PGPBs for Lycopersicon esculentum plant and to determine the appropriate volume for inoculation. Materials and Methods: Plants samples were collected from tomato fields. Nitrogen fixing-PGPBs were isolated from rhizoplane and rhizosphere. Five isolates were screened based on their growth abilities and examined for PGPB traits including phosphate solubilization, and IAA, ammonia and HCN production. After high cell density cultivation, the cells were separated by centrifugation and freeze dried after resuspension in cryoprotectant. The powders were inoculated into sterile soil with a dose of 10(6), 10(7) and 10(8) CFUs/g. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) seeds were sown in soil and after 42 days the shoot length was measured. Results: Most of the potent PGPBs with high growth capacity were isolated from rhizoplane. Maximum phosphate solubilization was 289.7 mug/ml by NFB12 which isolated from rhizoplane. This strain produced the maximum level of IAA. NFB12 produced ammonia without the ability of production of HCN. This strain enhanced shoot length in dosed dependent manner. Surprisingly, inoculation of soil with 10(8) CFUs/g dramatically decreased the shoot length by 21%. Based on molecular approach NFB12 was identified as Bacillus megaterium. Conclusion: Isolation of specific PGPBS is recommended for sustainable plant production.

Much of the activity in this field has centered on the bacterial enzyme CYP102A1, or BM3, from Bacillus megaterium, as it has shown itself capable of hydroxylating/acting upon a wide range of substrates, thereby producing industrially relevant pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and hormones. In addition, unlike most cytochromes, BM3 is both soluble and fused to its natural redox partner, thus facilitating its use. The industrial use of BM3 is however stifled by its instability and its requirement for the expensive NADPH cofactor. In this work, we added several mutations to the BM3 mutant R966D/W1046S that enhanced the turnover number achievable with the inexpensive cofactors NADH and NBAH. These new mutations, A769S, S847G, S850R, E852P, and V978L, are localized on the reductase domain of BM3 thus leaving the oxidase domain intact. For NBAH-driven reactions by new mutant NTD5, this led to a 5.24-fold increase in total product output when compared to the BM3 mutant R966D/W1046S. For reactions driven by NADH by new mutant NTD6, this enhanced total product output by as much as 2.3-fold when compared to the BM3 mutant R966D/W1046S. We also demonstrated that reactions driven by NADH with the NTD6 mutant not only surpassed total product output achievable by wild-type BM3 with NADPH but also retained the ability to use this latter cofactor with greater total product output as well.",1559-0291 (Electronic) 0273-2289 (Linking),2021 Apr 16,,"['10.1007/s12010-021-03573-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12010-021-03573-1 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,"['BM3', 'Consensus-guided evolution', 'Enzymatic process', 'N-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide', 'Protein engineering']",,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 60 self-reported medically healthy blood donors aged over 50 years. According to standard procedures, whole blood was separated by fractionation into plasma, buffy-coat, and red blood cell (RBC)-fractions. The buffy-coat was screened for bacterial contamination using BacT/ALERT. Samples from plasma and RBC-fractions were incubated anaerobically and aerobically at 37 degrees C for 7 days on trypticase soy blood agar (TSA). For identification, colony polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers targeting 16S rDNA. RESULTS: From 62% of the donors with periodontitis, bacterial growth was observed on at least 1 out of 4 plates inoculated with plasma or RBCs, whereas only 13% of plates inoculated with plasma or RBCs from periodontally healthy controls yielded bacterial growth (relative risk 6.4, 95% CI: 2.1; 19.5; p=0.0011). None of the donors tested positive for bacterial contamination using BacT/ALERT. Cutibacterium acnes was found in 31% of the donations from donors with periodontitis and in 10% of the donations from periodontally healthy donors. In addition, Staphylococcus species, Bacillus mycoides, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, and Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii were detected. DISCUSSION: Periodontitis increased the risk of bacterial contamination of blood products. Contaminating bacteria are often associated with the RBC-fraction. As the BacT/ALERT test is generally performed on platelet products, routine screening fails to detect many occurrences of viable bacteria in the RBC-fraction.",2385-2070 (Electronic) 1723-2007 (Linking),2021 Feb 2,,"['2021.0336-20 [pii]', '10.2450/2021.0336-20 [doi]']",['eng'],Italy,,,,

Often, sporicidal treatments prove insufficient to eradicate the contaminating endospore population as a whole, and might therefore serve as a selection pressure for enhanced endospore resistance. In the sporeforming Bacillus cereus group, Bacillus weihenstephanensis is an important food spoilage organism and potential cereulide producing pathogen, due to its psychrotolerant growth ability at 7 degrees C. Although the endospores of B. weihenstephanensis are generally less heat resistant compared to their mesophilic or thermotolerant relatives, our data now show that non-emetic B. weihenstephanensis strain LMG 18989(T) can readily and reproducibly evolve to acquire much enhanced endospore heat resistance. In fact, one of the B. weihenstephanensis mutants from directed evolution by wet heat in this study yielded endospores displaying a > 4-fold increase in D-value at 91 degrees C compared to the parental strain. Moreover, these mutant endospores retained their superior heat resistance even when sporulation was performed at 10 degrees C. Interestingly, increased endospore heat resistance did not negatively affect the vegetative growth capacities of the evolved mutants at lower (7 degrees C) and upper (37 degrees C) growth temperature boundaries, indicating that the correlation between cardinal growth temperatures and endospore heat resistance which is observed among bacterial sporeformers is not necessarily causal.",1879-3460 (Electronic) 0168-1605 (Linking),2021 Mar 2,,"['S0168-1605(21)00031-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.109072 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Bacillus cereus', 'D and Z value', 'Directed evolution', 'Endospore resistance', 'Heat resistance', 'Psychrotolerance']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In Listeria monocytogenes the transcriptional repressor MogR regulates motility in a temperature-dependent manner, directly repressing flagellar- and chemotaxis genes. The only other bacteria known to carry a mogR homolog are members of the Bacillus cereus group, which includes motile species such as B. cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis as well as the non-motile species Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus pseudomycoides. Furthermore, the main motility locus in B. cereus group bacteria, carrying the genes for flagellar synthesis, appears to be more closely related to L. monocytogenes than to Bacillus subtilis, which belongs to a separate phylogenetic group of Bacilli and does not carry a mogR ortholog. Here, we show that in B. thuringiensis, MogR overexpression results in non-motile cells devoid of flagella. Global gene expression profiling showed that 110 genes were differentially regulated by MogR overexpression, including flagellar motility genes, but also genes associated with virulence, stress response and biofilm lifestyle. Accordingly, phenotypic assays showed that MogR also affects cytotoxicity and biofilm formation in B. thuringiensis. Overexpression of a MogR variant mutated in two amino acids within the putative DNA binding domain restored phenotypes to those of an empty vector control. In accordance, introduction of these mutations resulted in complete loss in MogR binding to its candidate flagellar locus target site in vitro. In contrast to L. monocytogenes, MogR appears to be regulated in a growth-phase dependent and temperature-independent manner in B. thuringiensis 407. Interestingly, mogR was found to be conserved also in non-motile B. cereus group species such as B. mycoides and B. pseudomycoides, which both carry major gene deletions in the flagellar motility locus and where in B. pseudomycoides mogR is the only gene retained. Furthermore, mogR is expressed in non-motile B. anthracis. Altogether this provides indications of an expanded set of functions for MogR in B. cereus group species, beyond motility regulation. In conclusion, MogR constitutes a novel B. thuringiensis pleiotropic transcriptional regulator, acting as a repressor of motility genes, and affecting the expression of a variety of additional genes involved in biofilm formation and virulence.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2020,,['10.3389/fmicb.2020.610650 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Bacillus cereus group', 'MogR', 'biofilm', 'motility regulator', 'virulence']","['Copyright (c) 2020 Smith, Josefsen, Lindback, Hegna, Finke, Tourasse,', 'Nielsen-LeRoux, Okstad and Fagerlund.']",,

Phylogenetic analyses revealed all isolates are divided into six groups, which follows the generally accepted phylogenetic division of B. cereus sensu lato isolates. Four different identification methods resulted in a variation in the identity of the isolates, as none of the isolates were identified as the same species by all four methods-only the recent identification method proposed directly reflected the phylogeny of the isolates. This points to the importance of describing the basis and method used for the identification. The presence and percent identity of the protein product of 19 genes potentially involved in pathogenicity divided the 33 isolates into groups corresponding to phylogenetic division of the isolates. This suggests that different pathotypes exist and that it is possible to differentiate between them by comparing the percent identity of proteins potentially involved in pathogenicity. This also reveals that a basic link between phylogeny and pathogenicity is likely to exist. The geographical distribution of the isolates is not random: they are distributed in relation to their division into the six phylogenetic groups, which again relates to different ecotypes with different temperature growth ranges. This means that we find it easier to analyze and understand the results obtained from the 33 B. cereus sensu lato isolates in a phylogenetic, patho-type and ecotype-oriented context, than in a context based on uncertain identification at the species level.",2076-2607 (Print) 2076-2607 (Linking),2020 Dec 18,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4706-4023', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4851-2091', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4750-7488', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6865-6888', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9357-4537', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0187-9232', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1747-6641', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9321-0872', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7652-1465', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9492-3866']","['microorganisms8122028 [pii]', '10.3390/microorganisms8122028 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['Bacillus mosaicus', 'Bacillus mycoides', 'Bacillus thuringiensis', 'Bacillus toyonensis', 'ecotypes', 'geographical-distribution', 'patho-types', 'phylogeny']",,,

The objective of this study was to isolate amylase-producing bacteria from soil to determine the overall inhibition of certain pathogenic bacterial biofilms. Methods: We used serial dilution and the streaking method to obtain a total of 75 positive amylase isolates. The starch-agar plate method was used to screen the amylolytic activities of these isolates, and we used morphological and biochemical methods to characterize the isolates. Optimal conditions for amylase production and purification using Sephadex G-200 and SDS-PAGE were monitored. We screened these isolates' antagonistic activities and the purified amylase against pathogenic and multi-drug-resistant human bacteria using the agar disk diffusion method. Some standard antibiotics were controlled according to their degree of sensitivity. Finally, we used spectrophotometric methods to screen the antibiofilm 24 and 48 h after application of filtering and purifying enzymes in order to determine its efficacy at human pathogenic bacteria. Results: The isolated Bacillus species were Bacillus megaterium (26.7%), Bacillus subtilis (16%), Bacillus cereus (13.3%), Bacillus thuringiesis (10.7%), Bacillus lentus (10.7%), Bacillus mycoides (5.3%), Bacillus alvei (5.3%), Bacillus polymyxa (4%), Bacillus circulans (4%), and Micrococcus roseus (4%). Interestingly, all isolates showed a high antagonism to target pathogens. B. alevi had the highest recorded activity (48 mm) and B. polymyxa had the lowest recorded activity (12 mm) against Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to validate Eclipse Farm 4 G & COMET for the screening of antimicrobials in raw bovine milk according to AOAC Performance Tested MethodSM procedures. METHOD: The test is based on the inhibition of microbial growth of Geobacillus stearothermophilus in presence of antimicrobials. When sample tubes are incubated in the absence of antibiotics, spores germinate and cells grow changing medium color from purple to yellow (negative result). The presence of antimicrobials in the milk sample hinders bacterial growth preventing the tubes from changing color from purple to yellow (positive result).

However, CGTases also exhibit a competing hydrolysis activity. The +2 subsite of the substrate binding cleft plays an important role in both the disproportionation and hydrolysis activities, but almost all known mutations at this site decrease disproportionation activity. In this study, Leu(277) of the CGTase from Bacillus stearothermophilus NO2, located near both the +2 subsite and the catalytic acid/base Glu(253), was modified to assess the effect of side chain size at this position on disproportionation and hydrolysis activities. The best mutant, L277M, exhibited a reduced Km for the acceptor substrate maltose (0.48 mM versus 0.945 mM) and an increased k cat/Km (1175 s(-1)mM(-1) versus 686.1 s(-1)mM(-1)), compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. The disproportionation to hydrolysis ratio of L277M was 2.4-fold greater than that of the wild-type. Existing structural data were combined with a multiple sequence alignment and Gly(282) mutations to examine the mechanism behind the effects of the Leu(277)mutations. The Gly(282) mutations were included to aid a molecular-dynamics (MD) analysis and the comparison of crystal structures. They reveal that changes to a hydrophobic cluster near Glu(253) and the hydrophobicity of the +2 subsite combine to produce the observed effects.ImportanceIn this study, mutations that enhance the disproportionation to hydrolysis ratio of a CGTase have been discovered. For example, the disproportionation to hydrolysis ratio of the L277M mutant of Bacillus stearothermophilus NO2 CGTase was 2.4-fold greater than that of the wild-type. The mechanism behind the effects of these mutations is explained. This paper opens up other avenues for future research into the disproportionation and hydrolysis activities of CGTases.

Among bacterial isolates, a new Geobacillus stearothermophilus FMR12 efficiently utilized fish wastes at a concentration of 20% (w/v), exhibiting highly lipolytic activity at extreme thermal and alkaline pH conditions. Optimized fermentation parameters of TA lipase production were ascertained, promoting the productivity of the TA lipase from 424 to 1038 U/ml. Purification results of TA lipase exposed prominent specific activity of 4788 U/mg, purification fold of 12.44, and 7.8% yield. The purified TA lipase demonstrated outstanding activity and stability in a temperature range of 40-95 degrees C and pH (4-11), revealing optimal activity at 70 degrees C and pH 9. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 63 kDa. Compared to control, the TA lipase activity was promoted in the presence of calcium chloride. Likewise, Triton X-100 enhanced the activity of the TA lipase, recording 128% of the control enzyme.

In this study, the optimal signal peptide for alpha/beta-CGTase expression was screened from 173 signal peptides in B. subtilis WS11. The alpha/beta-CGTase activity in a 3-L fermentor reached 151.93 U mL(-1), but substantial amounts of inclusion bodies were produced. The N-terminal 12 amino acids of alpha/beta-CGTase were then replaced with the N-terminal 15 amino acids of a beta-CGTase from the same family that has a high percentage of disorder-promoting amino acids. As a result, the inclusion bodies were significantly reduced, and the enzyme activity increased to 249.35 U mL(-1), 2.3 times that of the strain constructed previously. Finally, the ppsE and sfp genes of B. subtilis WS11, which are related to lipopeptide biosurfactant synthesis, were knocked out to produce B. subtilis WS13. When B. subtilis WS13 was used to produce alpha/beta-CGTase in a 3-L fermentor, 70 % less defoaming agent was required than with B. subtilis WS11.

The continuous process was based on the generation of hydroxyl-radicals via the UV-C (254 nm) photo-degradation of hydrogen peroxide and ozone. The decontamination efficacy of the gAOP was dependent on the orientation of the N95 mask passing through the gAOP unit with those positioned horizontally enabling greater exposure to hydroxyl-radicals compared to when arranged vertically. The lethality of gAOP was independent of the applied hydrogen peroxide concentration (2-6% v/v) but was significantly (P<0.05) higher when H2O2 was introduced into the unit at 40 ml/min compared to 20 ml/min. A suitable treatment for N95 masks was identified as 3% v/v hydrogen peroxide delivered into the gAOP reactor at 40 ml/min with continuous introduction of ozone gas and a UV-C dose of 113 mJ/cm2 (30 s processing time). The treatment supported >6 log CFU decrease in Geobacillus stearothermophilus endospores, > 8 log reduction of human coronavirus 229E, and no detection of Escherichia coli K12 on the interior and exterior of masks. There was no negative effect on the N95 mask fitting or particulate efficacy after 20 passes through the gAOP system. No visual changes or hydrogen peroxide residues were detected (<1 ppm) in gAOP treated masks. The optimized gAOP treatment could also support >6 log CFU reduction of endospores inoculated on the interior or exterior of surgical masks. G. stearothermophilus Apex spore strips could be applied as a biological indicator to verify the performance of gAOP treatment. Also, a chemical indicator based on the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole was found suitable for reporting the generation of hydroxyl-radicals.

MDH has two characteristic loops, the mobile loop and the catalytic loop, in the active site. On binding to the substrate, the enzyme undergoes a structural change from the open-form, with an open conformation of the mobile loop, to the closed-form, with the loop in a closed conformation. In this study, three crystals of MDH from a moderate thermophile, Geobacillus stearothermophilus (gs-MDH) were used to determine four different enzyme structures (resolutions, 1.95-2.20 A), each of which was correspondingly assigned to its four catalytic states. Two OAA-unbound structures exhibited the open-form, while the other two OAA-bound structures exhibited both the open- and closed-form. The structural analysis suggested that the binding of OAA to the open-form gs-MDH promotes conformational change in the mobile loop and simultaneously activates the catalytic loop. The mutations on the key amino acid residues involving the proposed catalytic mechanism significantly affected the gs-MDH activity, supporting our hypothesis.

Thus, the development of novel proteases with high activities is meaningful to discover bioactive peptides. Because natural isolation from animal, plant and microbial sources is impractical to produce large quantities of proteases, gene cloning and expression of target protease are preferred. RESULTS: In this study, an alkaline serine protease gene (GsProS8) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus was successfully cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. The recombinant GsProS8 was produced with high protease activity of 3807 U/mL after high cell density fermentation. GsProS8 was then purified through ammonium sulfate precipitation and a two-step chromatographic method to obtain the homogeneous protease. The molecular mass of GsProS8 was estimated to be 27.2 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 28.3 kDa by gel filtration. The optimal activity of GsProS8 was found to be pH 8.5 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The protease exhibited a broad substrate specificity and different kinetic parameters to casein and whey protein. Furthermore, the hydrolysis of whey protein using GsProS8 resulted in a large amount of peptides with high angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity (IC50 of 0.129 mg/mL).

Perturbing the flux and expression of a single enzyme could have pleiotropic effects that may or may not dominate the impact on cell fitness. Here, we quantitatively dissect the molecular and global responses to varied expression of translation termination factors (peptide release factors, RFs) in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. While endogenous RF expression maximizes proliferation, deviations in expression lead to unexpected distal regulatory responses that dictate fitness reduction. Molecularly, RF depletion causes expression imbalance at specific operons, which activates master regulators and detrimentally overrides the transcriptome. Through these spurious connections, RF abundances are thus entrenched by focal points within the regulatory network, in one case located at a single stop codon.

In this regard, we herein aimed to reveal the beneficial effect of Sargassum fusiforme fucoidan (SFF) on high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced T2DM mice. We noted that on the one hand, SFF significantly decreased fasting blood glucose, diet and water intake, and hyperlipidemia, while on the other hand, it improved glucose tolerance. Furthermore, SFF reduced epididymal fat deposition, attenuated the pathological changes in heart and liver tissues, and decreased oxidative stress in diabetic mice. To explore the underlying mechanisms of these ameliorative effects, the gut microbiota was analyzed. Notably, SFF highly enriched benign microbes including Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium and Blautia, as well as increased levels of (R)-carnitine and choline in the colon of diabetic mice.

Earlier studies have shown that breastfeeding is associated with higher levels of health-promoting bacteria such and Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides via modulation of the immune system, and production of metabolites. As the infant gut matures and solid foods are introduced, it is unclear whether longer duration of breast feeding restore loss of beneficial taxa within the intestinal microbiota of operatively delivered infants. Within the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, we evaluated the longitudinal effect of delivery mode and infant feeding on the taxonomic composition and functional capacity of developing gut microbiota in the First year of life. Microbiota of 500 stool samples collected between 6 weeks and 12 months of age (from 229 infants) were characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was also performed on 350 samples collected at either 6 weeks or 12 months of age. Among infant participants, 28% were cesarean-delivered (CD) infants and most (95%) initiated breastfeeding within the first six months of life, with 26% exclusively breastfed and 69% mixed-fed (breast milk and formula), in addition to complementary foods by age 1. Alpha (within-sample) diversity was significantly lower in CD infants compared to vaginally delivered (VD) infants (P < 0.05) throughout the study period. Bacterial community composition clustering by both delivery mode and feeding duration at 1 year of age revealed that CD infants who were breast fed for < 6 months were more dissimilar to VD infants than CD infants who breast fed for >/= 6 months. We observed that breastfeeding modified the longitudinal impact of delivery mode on the taxonomic composition of the microbiota by 1 year of age, with an observed increase in abundance of Bacteroides fragilis and Lactobacillus with longer duration of breastfeeding among CD infants while there was an increase in Faecalibacterium for VD infants.

Risk factors for disease severity include older age, increased body mass index (BMI), diabetes, genetic variants, dietary factors and gut microbiota alterations. However, the interdependence of these factors and their individual impact on disease severity remain unknown.

RESULTS: Complete data was available for 57 NAFLD patients. In the simple regression analysis, features associated with the metabolic syndrome had the highest importance regarding liver disease severity. In the multiple regression analysis, BMI was the most important factor associated with the fibrosis stage (OR per kg/m(2) : 1.23, 95% CI 1.10-1.37, P<0.001). The PNPLA3 risk allele had the strongest association with the histological grade of steatosis (OR 5.32, 95% CI 1.56-18.11, P=0.007), followed by specific dietary patterns. Low abundances of Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides and Prevotella and high abundances of Gemmiger, were associated with the degree of inflammation, ballooning, and stages of fibrosis, even after taking other co-factors into account.

It is highly resistant to antibiotics and contains abundant antibiotic resistance mechanisms. METHODS: The antibiotic resistance pattern of 78 isolates of B. fragilis (22 strains from clinical samples and 56 strains from the colorectal tissue) was investigated using agar dilution method. The gene encoding Bacteroides fargilis toxin bft, and antibiotic resistance genes were targeted by PCR assay. RESULTS: The highest rate of resistance was observed for penicillin G (100%) followed by tetracycline (74.4%), clindamycin (41%) and cefoxitin (38.5%). Only a single isolate showed resistance to imipenem which contained cfiA and IS1186 genes. All isolates were susceptible to metronidazole. Accordingly, tetQ (87.2%), cepA (73.1%) and ermF (64.1%) were the most abundant antibiotic-resistant genes identified in this study. MIC values for penicillin, cefoxitin and clindamycin were significantly different among isolates with the cepA, cfxA and ermF in compare with those lacking such genes. In addition, 22.7 and 17.8% of clinical and GIT isolates had the bft gene, respectively.

Research has shown differing microbial composition based on geographic location, providing evidence that diverse biospecimen data is needed when studying human bacterial communities. Yet, limited research describes human milk and infant gut microbial communities in Africa. Our study uses breastmilk, stool, and meconium samples from a South African birth cohort to describe the microbial diversity, identify distinct taxonomic units, and determine correlations between bacterial abundance in breastmilk and stool samples. Mother-infant dyads (N = 20) were identified from a longitudinal birth cohort in the Vhembe district of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Breastmilk, meconium, and stool samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing of the V4-V5 gene region using the MiSeq platform for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. A non-metric multidimensional scaling using Bray-Curtis distances of sample Z-scores showed that meconium, stool, and breastmilk microbial communities are distinct with varying genus. Breastmilk was mostly comprised of Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Veillonella, and Corynebacterium. Stool samples showed the highest levels of Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides, and Streptococcus. Alpha diversity measures found that stool samples have the highest Shannon index score compared to breastmilk and meconium. The abundance of Bifidobacterium (r = 0.57), Blautia (r = 0.59), and Haemophilus (r = 0.69) was correlated (p < 0.1) between breastmilk and stool samples.

However, evidence from epidemiological studies is sparse. We therefore assessed the association of serological markers of E. coli and ETBF exposure with odds of developing CRC in the European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC) study.Serum samples of incident CRC cases and matched controls (n = 442 pairs) were analyzed for immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G antibody responses to seven E. coli proteins and two isoforms of the ETBF toxin via multiplex serology. Multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of sero-positivity to E. coli and ETBF with CRC.The IgA-positivity of any of the tested E. coli antigens was associated with higher odds of developing CRC (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.05-1.91). Dual-positivity for both IgA and IgG to E. coli and ETBF was associated with >1.7-fold higher odds of developing CRC, with a significant association only for IgG (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.94).

We aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of levornidazole after single and multiple oral doses of levornidazole tablets in healthy Chinese subjects and propose the dosing regimen based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with a single ascending dose (250, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg) and multiple doses of 500 mg levornidazole q12h for 7 days. Food effect on PK and absolute bioavailability were investigated at the 500 mg dose level. Blood and urine samples were collected to determine the PK parameters of levornidazole. The probability of target attainment (PTA) and cumulative fraction of response (CFR) were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation to predict the clinical efficacy of levornidazole tablets. RESULTS: Plasma concentration reached peak about 0.5 h after single dose (250-1500 mg) of levornidazole tablets. The maximal concentration (Cmax) and exposure (AUC0-infinity) of levornidazole increased linearly with dose. High-fat diet did not affect the absorption extent of levornidazole tablets. The absolute oral bioavailability of levornidazole tablets was 98.3% +/- 7.6%, associated with large apparent volume of distribution (48.68 +/- 4.92 l) and long half-life (11.93 +/- 1.28 h). The urinary excretion of levornidazole was 7.99%. Levornidazole, administered at either 500 mg q12h or 750 mg q24h, achieved a CFR > 95.4% and PTA > 99% for B. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration </= 1.0 mg/l) infections. CONCLUSION: Levornidazole tablets are absorbed rapidly and completely and distributed extensively with a long half-life and low urinary excretion after a single dose or multiple doses in healthy Chinese subjects. Levornidazole tablets can be taken with or without food. Levornidazole tablets 500 mg q12h and 750 mg q24h are expected to achieve the desired efficacy in B. fragilis infections.

Given the evolving recognition of the roles for bacteria in CRC, in this work, we investigate the effects of aspirin with a focus on one oncomicrobe-Fusobacterium nucleatum We show that aspirin and its primary metabolite salicylic acid alter F. nucleatum strain Fn7-1 growth in culture and that aspirin can effectively kill both actively growing and stationary Fn7-1. We also demonstrate that, at levels that do not inhibit growth, aspirin influences Fn7-1 gene expression. To assess whether aspirin modulation of F. nucleatum may be relevant in vivo, we use the Apc(Min/+) mouse intestinal tumor model in which Fn7-1 is orally inoculated daily to reveal that aspirin-supplemented chow is sufficient to inhibit F. nucleatum-potentiated colonic tumorigenesis. We expand our characterization of aspirin sensitivity across other F. nucleatum strains, including those isolated from human CRC tissues, as well as other CRC-associated microbes, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, and colibactin-producing Escherichia coli Finally, we determine that individuals who use aspirin daily have lower fusobacterial abundance in colon adenoma tissues, as determined by quantitative PCR performed on adenoma DNA. Together, our data support that aspirin has direct antibiotic activity against F. nucleatum strains and suggest that consideration of the potential effects of aspirin on the microbiome holds promise in optimizing risk-benefit assessments for use of aspirin in CRC prevention and management.IMPORTANCE There is an increasing understanding of the clinical correlations and potential mechanistic roles of specific members of the gut and tumoral microbiota in colorectal cancer (CRC) initiation, progression, and survival. However, we have yet to parlay this knowledge into better CRC outcomes through microbially informed diagnostic, preventive, or therapeutic approaches. Here, we demonstrate that aspirin, an established CRC chemopreventive, exhibits specific effects on the CRC-associated Fusobacterium nucleatum in culture, an animal model of intestinal tumorigenesis, and in human colonic adenoma tissues. Our work proposes a potential role for aspirin in influencing CRC-associated bacteria to prevent colorectal adenomas and cancer, beyond aspirin's canonical anti-inflammatory role targeting host tissues. Future research, such as studies investigating the effects of aspirin on fusobacterial load in patients, will help further elucidate the prospect of using aspirin to modulate F. nucleatum in vivo for improving CRC outcomes.",2150-7511 (Electronic),2021 Apr 6,,"['mBio.00547-21 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00547-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['*Fusobacterium nucleatum', '*aspirin', '*colon cancer']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Brennan et al.'],,

Accumulating evidence reveals a strong association between gut microbiota and adiposity. However, studies focusing on the role of gut microbiota in chicken obesity in conventional breeds are limited. Therefore, 400 random broilers with different levels of AFD were used to investigate the gut microbial taxa related to AFD by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 76 representative samples, and to identify the specific microbial taxa contributing to fat-related metabolism using shotgun metagenomic analyses of eight high and low AFD chickens. The results demonstrated that the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota decrease as the accumulation of chicken abdominal fat increases. The decrease of Bacteroidetes and the increase of Firmicutes were correlated with the accumulation of chicken AFD. The Bacteroidetes phylum, including the genera Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and the species, B. salanitronis, B. fragilis, and P. distasonis, were correlated to alleviate obesity by producing secondary metabolites. Several genera of Firmicutes phylum with circulating lipoprotein lipase activity were linked to the accumulation of chicken body fat. Moreover, the genera, Olsenella and Slackia, might positively contribute to fat and energy metabolism, whereas the genus, Methanobrevibacter, was possible to enhance energy capture, and associated to accumulate chicken AFD.

METHODS: Reproducibility of zone diameters and quality of growth were tested using six quality control (QC) strains. We compared four anaerobic incubation systems, two incubation temperatures (35 and 37 degrees C) and FAA from four manufacturers. The effect of incubation for 16-20 hours instead of 24 hours was tested on 10 randomly selected Bacteroides fragilis-group isolates.

The different anaerobic incubation systems were equal regarding quality of growth and zone diameters. Incubation at 35 degrees C resulted in slightly larger zones (1-2 mm) compared to 37 degrees C. Except for Acumedia FAA, the different manufacturers showed good agreement in zone diameters. All B. fragilis-group isolates displayed confluent growth after 16-20 hours. Metronidazole inhibition zones correlated well with the reference MICs. There was an area of poorer separation for meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam between 19-27 and 14-23 mm respectively.

The high incidence of CR-BFG isolated from our hospitalized patients has become an important problem. Therefore, we aimed to determine the frequency and associated factors for intestinal colonization by carbapenem-non-susceptible BFG (CNS-BFG) among adult patients hospitalized at intensive care units, neurosurgery and internal medicine wards in our hospital. METHODS: Rectal swabs (n=1200), collected from 766 patients between February 2014 and March 2015, were inoculated onto kanamycin-vancomycin-leaked blood agar containing 0.125mg/L meropenem. The isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution method. The carbapenemase gene (cfiA) was detected by PCR. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associated factors for intestinal colonization by CNS-BFG. RESULTS: A total 180 non-duplicate BFG isolates were obtained from 164 patients. Ten different species, including Parabacteroides distasonis (n=46, 25.6%), and Bacteroides fragilis (n=30; 16.6%), were identified. Twenty-five percent of the isolates were non-susceptible to meropenem (MIC >2mg/L). The highest prevalence of meropenem resistant strains (MIC >8mg/L) was detected among B. fragilis (n=12), followed by Parabacteroides spp. (n=4). All but one B. fragilis strains were cfiA gene positive. Hospital admission, increasing Charlson score, use of antibiotics; including carbapenems in past three months, colonization with other accompanying carbapenem-resistant Gram negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and having undergone surgical operations were significantly associated with RCS- BFG colonization.

The salivary and tongue microbiomes of one individual tended to be more similar to one another than to those of other individuals. The tablets did not affect the alpha or beta diversity of the oral microbiome, nor the abundance of specific bacterial species. Conclusions: While the salivary and tongue microbiomes differed significantly in terms of bacterial composition, they showed inter- rather than intra-individual diversity. A one-day usage of oral care tablets did not alter the salivary or tongue microbiomes of healthy adults. Whether the use of oral tablets for a longer period on healthy people or people with greater tongue coating accumulation shifts their oral microbiome needs to be investigated.",2046-1402 (Electronic) 2046-1402 (Linking),2020,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2190-7109'],['10.12688/f1000research.27502.2 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['QIIME 2', 'actinidin', 'amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)', 'oral care tablet', 'oral microbiome']",['Copyright: (c) 2021 Maruyama H et al.'],,

In this study, an attempt has been made to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance trend of oral Gram negative bacteria from Indian subjects. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 304 isolates against twelve different antibiotics were determined using gradient diffusion MIC strips. The organisms were isolated and identified based on phenotypic characteristics and included Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella species, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcoitans, Eickenella corrodens and Capnocytophaga species. For each antimicrobial agent, MIC50 and MIC90 were calculated and expressed. RESULTS: Resistance to azithromycin, clindamycin, and amoxicillin was observed in most of the anaerobic bacterial species studied. High degree of susceptibility was observed to amoxillin-clavulanic acid, doxycycline and moxifloxacin. A single strain of P. melaninogenica was resistant to moxifloxacin. The susceptibility pattern varied with cephalosporins among species. Ceftriaxone showed highest and cefazolin least efficacy among cephalosporins. All anaerobic bacteria tested were susceptible to metronidazole. Strains of T. forsythia were more resistant to several antibiotics than other anaerobic bacteria. All three species of capnophilic bacteria displayed high degree of resistance to metronidazole and significant resistance to amoxicillin, azithromycin, clindamycin, cefazolin and cefuroxime. CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, doxycycline, moxifloxacin and metronidazole appeared to be the most effective drugs against gram negative anaerobic bacteria. However, the MIC50 and MIC90 values against metronidazole were on the higher side of the normal indicating a potential for developing resistance.",1095-8274 (Electronic) 1075-9964 (Linking),2021 Apr 16,,"['S1075-9964(21)00050-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anaerobe.2021.102367 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['Antimicrobial Susceptibility', 'CLSI', 'Gram negative anaerobes', 'MIC', 'gradient diffusion testing']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The etiology and pathogenesis of OLP are still unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the bacterial community structure of buccal mucosa in patients with OLP and normal controls by high-throughput sequencing. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was uesd to detect Prevotella melaninogenica (P. melaninogenica) in 13 OLP samples and 10 controls. The amounts of P. melaninogenica in OLP buccal mucosa and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in co-culture of mouse-derived macrophages with P. melaninogenica were detected by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The P. melaninogenica was more abundant in OLP than in healthy controls and the differences were significant at the level of the phylum, family, genus and species (P<0.05). FISH showed that P. melaninogenica can invade the epithelium and even the lamina propria of OLP, while no invasion was found in the normal mucosa. P. melaninogenica can adhere to and invade macrophages and then activate the transcription of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

Methods: The oral examinations, questionnaires and tongue coating specimens were collected at the baseline and 12-month follow-up. All children were oral healthy at the enrollment. At the 12-month follow-up, children who developed halitosis were included to the halitosis group (n = 10). While children who matched the age, gender, kindergarten and without halitosis were included to the control group (n = 10). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to reveal the shift of the tongue coating microbiome in these children during the 12- month period with the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Results: A remarkable shift in relative abundance of specific bacteria was observed prior to halitosis development. The principal coordinates and alpha diversity analyses revealed different shifting patterns of halitosis and the healthy participants' microbiome structures and bacterial diversity over the 12-month follow-up. Both groups showed variable microbiota community structures before the onset of halitosis. Halitosis-enriched species Prevotella melaninogenica, Actinomyces sp._HMT_180 and Saccharibacteria TM7_G-1_bacterium_HMT_352 were finally selected as biomarkers in the halitosis-onset prediction model after screening, with a prediction accuracy of 91.7%. Conclusions: The microbiome composition and relative abundance of the tongue coatings in the halitosis and control groups remarkably differed, even prior to the onset of the clinical manifestations of halitosis. The halitosis prediction model constructed on the basis of tongue coating microbiome biomarkers indicated the microbial shifts before the halitosis onset.

METHODS: Saliva and stool samples from 9 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 11 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 5 healthy controls were subjected to 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing at baseline and at 3 months following RIC.

Although oral microbiome has been reported to correlate with different oral diseases, there appears to be an absence of research recognizing any relationship between the severity of dental fluorosis and the oral microbiome. To this end, we investigated the changes in oral microbial community structure and identified bacterial species associated with moderate and severe dental fluorosis. Salivary samples of 42 individuals, assigned into Healthy (N = 9), Mild (N = 14) and Moderate/Severe (M&S, N = 19), were investigated using the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. The oral microbial community structure based on Bray Curtis and Weighted Unifrac were significantly changed in the M&S group compared with both of Healthy and Mild. As the predominant phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes showed variation in the relative abundance among groups. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio was significantly higher in the M&S group. LEfSe analysis was used to identify differentially represented taxa at the species level. Several genera such as Streptococcus mitis, Gemella parahaemolysans, Lactococcus lactis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were significantly more abundant in patients with moderate/severe dental fluorosis, while Prevotella melaninogenica and Schaalia odontolytica were enriched in the Healthy group. In conclusion, our study indicates oral microbiome shift in patients with moderate/severe dental fluorosis. We identified several differentially represented bacterial species enriched in moderate and severe fluorosis. Findings from this study suggests that the roles of these bacteria in oral health and related diseases warrant more consideration in patients with moderate and severe fluorosis.",2045-2322 (Electronic) 2045-2322 (Linking),2021 Feb 3,,"['10.1038/s41598-021-82709-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-82709-z [pii]']",['eng'],England,,,,

Herewith, lower microbial diversity in CF airways is typically associated with worse health outcomes. In an attempt to treat CF lung infections patients are frequently exposed to antibiotics, which may affect microbial diversity. This study aimed at understanding if common antibiotics that target P. aeruginosa influence microbial diversity. To this end, a microaerophilic multispecies biofilm model of frequently co-isolated members of the CF lung microbiome (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Rothia mucilaginosa, and Gemella haemolysans) was exposed to antipseudomonal antibiotics. We found that antibiotics that affected several dominant species (i.e. ceftazidime, tobramycin) resulted in higher species evenness compared to colistin, which is only active against P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, susceptibility of individual species in the multispecies biofilm following antibiotic treatment was compared to that of the respective single-species biofilms, showing no differences. Adding three anaerobic species (Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella parvula, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) to the multispecies biofilm did not influence antibiotic susceptibility.

The oral microbiome, in turn, can be altered by local and systemic diseases and conditions. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), has been associated with increased acidity in the oral cavity resulting in dental erosion, and controversially a reduced risk of periodontal disease. We hypothesized that presence of GERD was linked to a modified microbial profile in untreated GERD patients and that the use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs: potent disruptors of gut microbiome, in GERD patients might result in a salivary microbiome that is further distinct. Untreated GERD patients showed multiple differences in salivary microbiome as compared to healthy controls. Taxa found at lower levels related to the presence of GERD not treated by PPI included: Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella pallens, Leptotrichia, and Solobacterium moorei and thirteen others.

Meanwhile, the microbiota on the tongue surface is thought to be a major source of salivary microbiota. Therefore, surgical resection of the tongue for definitive treatment of oral cancer could drastically change the salivary bacterial balance and virulence. Here, we investigated the shift of the salivary microbiota following surgical resection in patients with tongue cancer. The stimulated saliva samples were collected from 25 tongue cancer patients pre- and post-resection of the tongue, and bacterial density and composition was determined using quantitative PCR analysis and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing, respectively. Although no significant difference in the total bacterial density in saliva pre- and post-surgery was observed, the bacterial composition significantly differed according to the analysis of similarity. Among predominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with >/=1% of relative abundance, the proportions of OTUs corresponding to Streptococcus salivarius, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Prevotella histicola were significantly decreased following the tongue resection. On the other hand, the proportions of OTUs corresponding to Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria flava, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, known to be inhabitants of dental plaque, were significantly increased. These results suggest that surgical resection of the tongue causes a compositional shift of the salivary microbiota, characterized by an increase in bacterial species derived from dental plaque, including periodontal pathogens.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the bacterial community composition in caries-active and caries-free children. METHODS: Supragingival plaque samples were collected from 64 caries-active and 64 caries-free Middle Eastern children. The hypervariable V3-V4 of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced with Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing. Microbial community structure and composition analyses were performed by processing operational taxonomic units. Bioinformatic analyses, including analysis of similarity, alpha and beta diversities, and principal coordinate analysis, were carried out. RESULTS: Diversity indices did not find differences between the caries-active and caries-free groups (p > 0.05). Similarity analysis demonstrated that the microbiota composition did not differ between the two groups. Comparative analysis at the species level revealed a significantly higher relative abundance of Leptotrichia shahii, Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella dispar, Leptotrichia HOT 498, and Streptococcus mutans in caries-active children (p < 0.05). Corynebacterium matruchotii, Lautropia mirabilis, Neisseria elongata, and Corynebacterium durum were relatively more abundant in the caries-free group (p < 0.05). Species belonging to the Leptotrichia, Prevotella, and Veillonella genera were significantly predominant in the caries-active subjects. CONCLUSION: In view of the lack of a clear association between Corynebacterium spp. and dental caries status in the literature, the predominance of these species in caries-free children warrants further research to understand their possible role in a health-associated microbial community.

In Spain, five Argas species have been recorded, including three ornitophilic nidicolous ticks, but their associated microorganisms remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate ticks from bird nests and their microorganisms. Ticks were collected extensively from natural cavities and nest-boxes used by European rollers (Coracias garrulus) and little owls (Athene noctua) in Southeastern and Central Spain. Ticks were morphologically and genetically identified and corresponding DNA/RNA tick extracts were analyzed [individually (n = 150) or pooled (n = 43)] using specific PCR assays for bacteria (Anaplasmataceae, Bartonella, Borrelia, Coxiella/Rickettsiella, and Rickettsia spp.), viruses (Flaviviruses, Orthonairoviruses, and Phenuiviruses), and protozoa (Babesia/Theileria spp.). Six Argas genotypes were identified, of which only those of Argas reflexus (n = 8) were identified to the species level. Two other genotypes were closely related to each other and to Argas vulgaris (n = 83) and Argas polonicus (n = 33), respectively. These two species have not been previously reported from Western Europe. Two additional genotypes (n = 4) clustered with Argas persicus, previously reported in Spain. The remaining genotype (n = 22) showed low sequence identity with any Argas species, being most similar to the African Argas africolumbae. The microbiological screening revealed infection with a rickettsial strain belonging to Rickettsia fournieri and Candidatus Rickettsia vini group in 74.7% of ticks, mainly comprising ticks genetically related to A. vulgaris and A. polonicus. Other tick endosymbionts belonging to Coxiella, Francisella and Rickettsiella species were detected in ten, one and one tick pools, respectively. In addition, one Babesia genotype, closely related to avian Babesia species, was found in one tick pool. Lastly, Anaplasmataceae, Bartonella, Borrelia, and viruses were not detected. In conclusion, five novel Argas genotypes and their associated microorganisms with unproven pathogenicity are reported for Spain. The re-use of nests between and within years by different bird species appears to be ideal for the transmission of tick-borne microorganisms in cavity-nesting birds of semiarid areas.

Currently, bacterial species are defined as including strains that present 95-96% of average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 70% of digital DDH (dDDH). Thus, ANI values from 520 genome sequences of type strains from species of Rhizobiales order were computed. From the resulting 270,400 comparisons, a >/=95% cut-off was used to extract high identity genome clusters through enumerating maximal cliques. Coupling this graph-based approach with dDDH from clusters of interest, it was found that: (i) there are synonymy between Aminobacter lissarensis and Aminobacter carboxidus, Aurantimonas manganoxydans and Aurantimonas coralicida, ""Bartonella mastomydis,"" and Bartonella elizabethae, Chelativorans oligotrophicus, and Chelativorans multitrophicus, Rhizobium azibense, and Rhizobium gallicum, Rhizobium fabae, and Rhizobium pisi, and Rhodoplanes piscinae and Rhodoplanes serenus; (ii) Chelatobacter heintzii is not a synonym of Aminobacter aminovorans; (iii) ""Bartonella vinsonii"" subsp. arupensis and ""B. vinsonii"" subsp. berkhoffii represent members of different species; (iv) the genome accessions GCF_003024615.1 (""Mesorhizobium loti LMG 6,125(T)""), GCF_003024595.1 (""Mesorhizobium plurifarium LMG 11,892(T)""), GCF_003096615.1 (""Methylobacterium organophilum DSM 760(T)""), and GCF_000373025.1 (""R. gallicum R-602 sp(T)"") are not from the genuine type strains used for the respective species descriptions; and v) ""Xanthobacter autotrophicus"" Py2 and ""Aminobacter aminovorans"" KCTC 2,477(T) represent cases of misuse of the term ""type strain"".

The Tygerberg Endocarditis Cohort (TEC) study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of patients with confirmed or suspected IE presenting to Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Current analysis includes patients that presented between November 2019 and August 2020. Forty four (44) patients have been included in this ongoing study. Fourteen of the 44 patients (31.8%) had BCNE. Further analysis of the patients with BCNE identified Bartonella species as the most common causative organism (n=6; 43%). Other causes included Mycoplasma species (n=2). No cause could be identified in 4 of the 44 patients (9%). Bartonella quintana was identified with PCR of valvular tissue as the causative organism in 4 of the 5 patients that underwent urgent surgery.

We combed the literature from antiquity to present day using Medline and EMBASE, reviewing the pubic louse's origins, its evolution with mankind, presentation and management. Medline and EMBASE provided the greatest yield of literature compared to other databases. PtP incidence estimates range from 0.3-4.6% and prevalence around 2% in adults. War, disasters and overcrowding support lice transmission, but modern pubic hair grooming has reduced PtP in recent years. PtP, is usually found on pubic hair, but may infest scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes and body hair. Reports suggest the possibility of PtP as a vector for Bartonella spp. and Acinetobacter spp., requiring further studies. Transmission is via close contact, so sexual abuse and concomitant STIs should be considered. Symptoms and signs include: pruritus, red papules and rust/brown deposits from feeding or faecal matter. Visualisation of live lice confirms diagnosis. Long-standing treatments include hand-picking and combing, but in modern times pediculicidal products may generate faster resolution. Permethrin or pyrethrins are first-line recommendations. Resistance to pediculicides is common with head lice and is presumed likely in PtP although data are lacking. Pseudo-resistance occurs due to poor compliance, incorrect or ineffective dosing and reinfestation. In true resistance, a different pediculicide class should be used e.g., second-line agents: phenothrin, malathion or ivermectin. Lice have existed long before humans and given their adaptability, despite habitat challenges from fashion trends in body hair-removal, are likely to continue to survive.",1365-2230 (Electronic) 0307-6938 (Linking),2021 Apr 3,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3393-8305'],['10.1111/ced.14666 [doi]'],['eng'],England,,['This article is protected by copyright.

Bartonella spp. prevalence in small mammals from Myanmar and Sri Lanka are yet unknown. (2) Methods: Small mammals were snap trapped in Sri Lanka and Myanmar in urban surroundings. Spleens-derived DNA was screened for Bartonella spp. using conventional PCR based on three target genes. Positive samples were sequenced. (3) Results: 994 small mammals were collected comprising 6 species: Bandicota bengalensis, Bandicota indica, Rattus exulans, Rattus rattus, Mus booduga, and Suncus murinus.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical chart review. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cases of 15 consecutive patients (19 affected eyes) in Kochi Prefecture, Japan who were serologically positive for Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana infection in association with intraocular inflammation were reviewed. The clinical manifestations, ocular complications, and treatment modalities were recorded. The clinical charts and photographic records were also reviewed for evidence of optic disc lesions, macular star, foci of chorioretinitis, and other findings. RESULTS: Thirteen patients reported fever before or at the time of the initial presentation. Ten of 11 patients with decreased visual acuity manifested neuroretinitis, and the remaining patient showed retinochoroiditis with macular involvement. One patient with a visual field defect manifested branch retinal artery occlusion. Three patients without visual disturbance presented with fever of unknown cause. Discrete white retinal or retinochoroidal lesions were the most common findings (84% of eyes, 87% of patients), followed by retinal hemorrhage (63% of eyes, 80% of patients), optic disc lesions (63% of eyes, 73% of patients), serous retinal detachment (53% of eyes, 67% of patients), and macular star (47% of eyes, 60% of patients). CONCLUSION: White retinal or retinochoroidal foci were the most common ocular posterior segment manifestations of CSD in this patient population.

Diagnosis was confirmed by conventional PCR and DNA sequencing of surgical cardiac specimens. Similarly to IFA, anti-Bartonella IgG titers >/=1:800 were found in 94% of patients by EIA; cross-reactivity between B. henselae and B. quintana precluded species-specific serodiagnosis, and frequent (41%) but low-titer cross-reactivity between Coxiella burnetii antibodies and B. henselae antigen was found in patients with Q fever endocarditis.

In North America and Europe, high vaccine coverage in children has led to a shift in the age-specific peak incidence of infection away from infants and towards older children and adolescents. However, much less is known about the prevalence of pertussis in older children and adults in the Middle East. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS was undertaken to identify studies published between 1 January 1990 and 17 June 2019, with information on pertussis epidemiology, burden of illness, and mortality in school-aged children, adolescents, and adults in the Middle East. Studies identified for inclusion were reviewed narratively because a statistical comparison was not possible because of the mix of methodologies used. The results showed that surveillance data are weak or missing in most Middle Eastern countries, and among 24 epidemiological studies identified, most were from Iran (14), Israel (4), and Turkey (3), with single studies from the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. Despite various surveillance periods, clinical definitions, and antibody cut-off values used across the studies, the reported seroprevalence of pertussis antibodies suggested that adolescents and adults are commonly exposed to pertussis in the community and that vaccine-acquired immunity from childhood wanes. Few countries in the Middle East include a diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (Tdap) booster for adolescents on the national schedule. Israel was the only country with epidemiological data in a population that received Tdap, and the study showed that after the introduction of the adolescent booster dose, there was decrease in pertussis among children aged 5-14 years.

It helps the bacteria, including bacterial pathogens of airway diseases, to persist and eventually switch to a typical extracellular infection. Several infectious diseases of the lung are life-threatening and their control is impeded by intracellular persistence of pathogens. Thus, molecular adaptations of the pathogens to this niche but also the host's response and potential targets to interfere are of relevance. Here we discuss examples of historically considered extracellular pathogens of the respiratory airway where the intracellular survival and proliferation is well documented, including infections by Staphylococcus aureus, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and others. RECENT FINDINGS: Current studies focus on bacterial factors contributing to adhesion, iron acquisition, and intracellular survival as well as ways to target them for combatting the bacterial infections.

Here, we discuss the progress in understanding the impacts of RTX toxin activities on host immunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Bordetella pertussis CyaA activity paralyzes sentinel phagocytic cells by elevating cellular cAMP levels and blocks differentiation of infiltrating monocytes into bactericidal macrophages, promoting also de-differentiation of resident alveolar macrophages into monocyte-like cells. Vibrio cholerae multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxins (MARTX), through Rho inactivating and alpha/beta-hydrolase (ABH) domain action blocks mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in epithelial cells and dampens the inflammatory responses of intestinal epithelia by blocking immune cell recruitment. The action of actin crosslinking effector domain and Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP) domains of MARTX compromises the phagocytic ability of macrophages. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans LtxA action triggers neutrophil elastase release into periodontal tissue, compromising the epithelial barrier and promoting bacterial spreads into deeper tissue. SUMMARY: Action of RTX toxins enables bacterial pathogens to cope with the fierce host immune defenses. RTX toxins often block phagocytosis and bactericidal reactive oxygen species and NO production. Some RTX toxins can reprogram the macrophages to less bactericidal cell types. Autophagy is hijacked for example by the activity of the V. cholerae ABH effector domain of the MARTX protein.

Gradually, rats have become predominant in cities, sometimes staying in close vicinity to humans, pets, and other animals. Consequently, they tend to increase the transmission risk of pathogens. Case Description: Here, we report an original case of bacterial pneumonia in a street rat (Rattus norvegicus). The rat was found dead on a street in the chief town of Marseille (France) after being run over by a car. The necropsy of the corpse revealed generalized granulomatous pneumonia in almost all the pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions and predominantly multiple fibro-inflammatory areas are presumably the witness of an infectious etiology. Bacterial isolation was carried out from lung tissues. Colonies were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The following bacteria were identified: Staphylococcus cohnii, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Bordetella parapertussi, Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum, Pelistega suis and Rodentibacter rarus. Based on the histopathological diagnosis and the avoidance approach, the most likely etiological agent of pneumonia is therefore R. rarus, a little-known Pasteurellales bacterium that is closely related to Rodentibacter pneumotropicus. Conclusion: These data emphasize the severity of R. rarus infection in rodents. Thus, pointing out a potential risk for other animals (dogs, cats, and birds), as well as humans.

Vaccines, massively implemented since the middle of the last century, have substantially reduced the pertussis incidence, but have not been able to fully control the disease. One of the shortcomings of current pertussis vaccines is their inability to prevent infection by and transmission of B. pertussis, in contrast to immunity following natural infection. We have developed the live attenuated nasal vaccine BPZE1 and have shown that it prevents both disease and B. pertussis infection in preclinical models. This vaccine is now in clinical development. However, the initial clinical studies have suggested that vaccine take is hampered by pre-existing antibodies to pertactin. Here, we have constructed a pertactin-deficient BPZE1 derivative called BPZE1P in order to overcome this limitation. BPZE1P colonized the murine respiratory tract as efficiently as BPZE1 and induced antibodies at levels similar to those elicited by BPZE1. In the presence of pre-existing antibodies induced by acellular pertussis vaccination, BPZE1P colonized the mouse respiratory tract more efficiently than BPZE1. Both vaccines protected equally well the murine lungs and noses from challenge with laboratory and clinical strains of B. pertussis, including pertactin-deficient strains, against which current acellular pertussis vaccines are less efficient. BPZE1P may thus be an interesting alternative to BPZE1 to overcome vaccine take limitations due to pre-existing antibodies to pertactin.",1873-2518 (Electronic) 0264-410X (Linking),2021 Apr 22,,"['S0264-410X(21)00449-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.04.014 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Bordetella pertussis', 'Live attenuated vaccine', 'Pertactin', 'Pertussis', 'Whooping cough']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The clinical presentation that was observed most frequently includes paroxysmal coughing (97%), difficulty breathing (69.7%), cyanosis (72.7%) and post-tussive emesis (60.6%). Additionally, pneumonia was the most observed complication (33.3%). Four of the patients with PCR+ for B. pertussis presented only lymphocytosis, five only leukocytosis, two patients with decreased leukocytosis and lymphocytes and only one patient with leukopenia and relative lymphocytosis. There was a percentage of 84.8% of unvaccinated children in the PCR+ group. Finally, the mother was the most frequent symptom carrier (18.2%). Conclusion: In conclusion, in the studied population there is a high rate of PCR+ cases for B. pertussis. Laboratory values may show leukopenia or lymphopenia in patients with pertussis.

NMU has two receptors, NMU receptor 1 (NMUR1) and NMUR2, both of which are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Only NMUR1 is expressed in mouse islets and beta cell-derived MIN6-K8 cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the insulinostatic action mediated by NMUR1 in beta cells have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanism driving impairment of insulin secretion in beta cells by the NMU-NMUR1 axis. Pretreatment with the Galphai/o inhibitor Bordetella pertussis toxin (PTX), but not the Galphaq inhibitor YM254890, abolished NMU-induced suppression of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and calcium response in beta cells. Knockdown of Galphai2 and Galphao in beta cells counteracted NMU-induced suppression of insulin secretion and gene alterations related to mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2), fission (Fis1, Drp1), mitophagy (Pink1, Park2), mitochondrial dynamics (Pgc-1alpha, Nrf1, and Tfam), ER stress (Chop, Atp2a3, Ryr2, and Itpr2), intracellular ATP level, and mitochondrial membrane potential. NMU decreased forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP in both mouse and human islets. We concluded that NMUR1 coupled to PTX-sensitive Galphai2 and Galphao proteins in beta cells reduced intracellular Ca2+ influx and cAMP level, thereby causing beta-cell dysfunction and impairment.

This effector is known to contain two functional domains, including an N-terminal lipid raft-targeting (LRT) domain, and a cytotoxic C-terminal domain that induces non-apoptotic and caspase-1-independent host cell death. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of BteA with plasma membrane as well as its cytotoxic activity in the course of Bordetella infections remain poorly understood. Using a protein-lipid overlay assay and surface plasmon resonance, we show here that the recombinant LRT domain binds negatively-charged membrane phospholipids. Specifically, we determined that the dissociation constants of the LRT domain binding liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidic acid (PA), and phosphatidylserine (PS) were approximately 450 nM, approximately 490 nM, and approximately 1.2 muM, respectively. Both PS and PIP2 were required to target the LRT domain and/or full-length BteA to the plasma membrane of yeast cells. The membrane association further involved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of LRT, and depended on a leucine residue in the L1 loop between the first two helices of the four-helix bundle. Importantly, charge-reversal substitutions within the L1 region disrupted plasma membrane localization of the BteA effector without hampering its cytotoxic activity during B. bronchiseptica infection of HeLa cells.

Bronchopneumonia caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb) is common but the associated increase in CRP concentration in naturally infected dogs has not been fully explored. OBJECTIVE: To compare CRP concentrations of dogs with Bb infection, with or without radiographic pulmonary lesions, to dogs with aspiration bronchopneumonia (ABP). ANIMALS: Sixteen dogs with Bb infection and 36 dogs with ABP. METHODS: Retrospective study. C-reactive protein concentrations and thoracic radiographs were available for each dog. RESULTS: Eleven dogs with Bb infection had alveolar lesions. In all dogs, CRP concentration was mildly increased (14-38 mg/L). In the 5 dogs without alveolar lesions, CRP concentration was within the reference range in all but 1 dog, in which it was slightly increased. Median CRP concentration was significantly higher in dogs with alveolar lesions (20 mg/L) compared with dogs without alveolar lesions (5 mg/L; p < .002). In dogs with Bb infection, median duration of clinical signs was not different between dogs with normal CRP concentration and dogs with increased concentration. In dogs with Bb infection either with or without alveolar lessions, median CRP concentration was significantly lower (20 mg/L) than in dogs with ABP (118 mg/L; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In contrast to dogs with APB, CRP was not a good marker for the diagnosis of dogs suspected to have bordetellosis.

Monitoring programmes for antibiotic resistance are currently in place in food-producing animals in the European Union covering the zoonotic bacteria Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni and the indicator bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. However, there is no equivalent pan-European statutory monitoring programme covering the antibiotic susceptibility of veterinary bacterial pathogens in food animals. This paper considers that issue and aims to facilitate and stimulate further discussion. METHODS: Recommendations, proposed by the authors from the scientific literature and following expert discussion at international meetings, are presented for monitoring the susceptibility of key veterinary pathogens. RESULTS: The selected veterinary pathogens comprise Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, E. coli, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. from the major food animal species cattle, pigs and poultry. The organisms are tested using harmonised panels of antibiotics over specified dilution ranges in a broth microdilution method. CONCLUSION: The selected antibiotics and their respective dilution ranges are presented together with the underlying rationale for inclusion; the ranges chosen are suitable for incorporation into three microtitre plates, with each organism tested using a single plate.

A Gottingen minipig model was assessed, using pertussis vaccines, to demonstrate that vaccine antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses, including IgG titers, functional antibodies, Th polarization and memory B cells can be assessed in a longitudinal study. A vaccination schedule of priming with a whole cell (DTwP) or an acellular (DTaP) pertussis vaccine was applied in neonatal and infant minipigs followed by boosting with a Tdap acellular vaccine. Single cell RNAsequencing was used to explore the long-term maintenance of immune memory cells and their functionality for the first time in this animal model. DTaP but not DTwP vaccination induced pertussis toxin (PT) neutralizing antibodies. The cellular immune response was also characterized by a distinct Th polarization, with a Th-2-biased response for DTaP and a Th-1/Th-17-biased response for DTwP. No difference in the maintenance of pertussis-specific memory B cells was observed in DTaP- or DTwP-primed animals 6 months post Tdap boost. However, an increase in pertussis-specific T cells was still observed in DTaP primed minipigs, together with up-regulation of genes involved in antigen presentation and interferon pathways. Overall, the minipig model reproduced the humoral and cellular immune responses induced in humans by DTwP vs. DTaP priming, followed by Tdap boosting.

253,33807962,"['Locht, Camille']",The Path to New Pediatric Vaccines against Pertussis.,"Whooping cough, or pertussis, mostly caused by Bordetella pertussis, is a respiratory disease that affects all age groups, but severe and fatal pertussis occurs almost exclusively in young children. The widespread use of whole-cell and, more recently, of acellular vaccines has substantially reduced the disease incidence. However, it has not been eliminated in any part of the world and has made a worrisome rebound in several areas. Cocoon and maternal immunization have been implemented in several countries but have their intrinsic limitations. To effectively control pertussis, novel vaccines are needed that protect against disease and prevent B. pertussis infection and transmission, which is not the case for current vaccines. Several approaches are contemplated, including alternative administration routes, such as nasal immunization, improvement of acellular vaccines by adding more antigens and T-cell-promoting adjuvants, and the development of novel vaccines, such as outer membrane vesicles and live attenuated vaccines. Among them, only a live attenuated vaccine has so far been assessed for safety and immunogenicity in preclinical models other than mice and is in clinical development. Before any of these vaccines can be used in neonates, extensive safety and immunogenicity assessment in pre-clinical neonatal models and in carefully designed clinical trials is necessary.

Early treatment with corticosteroids has been shown to be effective in Bell's palsy and antibiotics improve outcome in LNB, but there is a lack of knowledge on how the addition of corticosteroids to standard antibiotic treatment affects outcome in LNB PFP. METHODS: This prospective open trial with historical controls was conducted at two large hospitals in western Sweden between 2011 and 2018. Adults presenting with LNB PFP were included in the study group and were treated with oral doxycycline 200 mg b.i.d. for 10 days and prednisolone 60 mg o.d. for 5 days, then tapered over 5 days. The historical controls were adult patients with LNB PFP included in previous studies and treated with oral doxycycline.

The division of genera is supported by phylogenomic evidence from whole genomes and by several specific molecular markers. These distinguishing phylogenetic criteria also applied to three new species or isolates of Borrelia that were discovered in ixodid ticks of reptiles, a monotreme, and birds.

The constellation of symptoms attributable to this malady result from vascular dissemination of B. burgdorferi throughout the body to invade various tissue types. However, little is known about the mechanism by which the spirochetes can breach the blood vessel wall to reach distant tissues. We have studied this process by direct observation of spirochetes in the microvasculature of living mice using multilaser spinning-disk intravital microscopy. Our results show that in our experimental system, instead of phagocytizing B. burgdorferi, host neutrophils are involved in the production of specific cytokines that activate the endothelium and potentiate B. burgdorferi escape into the surrounding tissue.

260,33878571,"['Ratti, Vardayani', 'Winter, Jonathan M', 'Wallace, Dorothy I']",Dilution and amplification effects in Lyme disease: Modeling the effects of reservoir-incompetent hosts on Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto transmission.,"The literature on Lyme disease includes a lively debate about the paradoxical role of changing deer populations. A decrease in the number of deer will both (1) reduce the incidence of Lyme disease by decreasing the host populations for ticks and therefore tick populations, and (2) enhance the incidence of Lyme disease by offering fewer reservoir-incompetent hosts for ticks, forcing the vector to choose reservoir-competent, and therefore possibly diseased, hosts to feed on. A review of field studies exploring the net impact of changing deer populations shows mixed results. In this manuscript, we investigate the hypothesis that the balance of these two responses to changing deer populations depends on the relative population sizes of reservoir-competent vs. reservoir-incompetent hosts and the presence of host preference in larval and adult stages. A temperature driven seasonal model of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (cause of Lyme disease) transmission among three host types (reservoir-competent infected and uninfected hosts, and reservoir-incompetent hosts) is constructed as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The model, which produces biologically reasonable results for both the tick vector Ixodes scapularis Say 1921 and the hosts, is used to investigate the effects of reservoir-incompetent host removal on both tick populations and disease prevalence for various relative population sizes of reservoir-competent hosts vs. reservoir-incompetent hosts. In summary, the simulation results show that the model with host preference appears to be more accurate than the one with no host preference. Given these results, we found that removal of adult I. scapularis(Say) hosts is likely to reduce questing nymph populations.

Information on the Brucella species circulating in different hosts in Kenya is largely unknown, thus limiting the adoption of targeted control strategies. This study was conducted in multi-host livestock populations in Kenya to detect the circulating Brucella species and assess evidence of host-pathogen associations. Serum samples were collected from 228 cattle, 162 goats, 158 sheep, 49 camels, and 257 humans from Narok and Marsabit counties in Kenya. Information on age, location and history of abortion or retained placenta were obtained for sampled livestock. Data on age, gender and location of residence were also collected for human participants. All samples were tested using genus level real-time PCR assays with primers specific for IS711 and bcsp31 targets for the detection of Brucella. All genus positive samples (positive for both targets) were further tested with a speciation assay for AlkB and BMEI1162 targets, specific for B. abortus and B. melitensis, respectively. Samples with adequate quantities aggregating to 577 were also tested with the Rose Bengal Test (RBT). A total of 199 (33.3%) livestock and 99 (38.5%) human samples tested positive for genus Brucella. Animal Brucella PCR positive status was positively predicted by RBT positive results (OR = 8.3, 95% CI 4.0-17.1). Humans aged 21-40 years had higher odds (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.6) of being Brucella PCR positive compared to the other age categories. The data on detection of different Brucella species indicates that B. abortus was detected more often in cattle (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.1-4.6) and camels (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.3), while B. melitensis was detected more in sheep (OR = 3.6, 95% CI 2.0-6.7) and goats (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-3.1). Both B. abortus and B. melitensis DNA were detected in humans and in multiple livestock host species, suggesting cross-transmission of these species among the different hosts.

The clinical appearance of brucellosis is not specific, but the course and severity of the infection varies. In this study, it was aimed to determine the relationship between laboratory parameters and clinical response and organ involvement in patients with Brucellosis diagnosed with specific diagnostic tests. In the study, 100 patients without previous diagnosis of Brucellosis who have admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology and had positive Brucella tube agglutination tests and whose clinic was compatible with Brucellosis were evaluated prospectively. Patients were invited to be checked in the 1st, 2nd and 6th weeks . Patients with hip pain and low back pain were evaluated with sacroiliac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar MRI for sacroiliitis and spondylodiscitis. Patients with liver and bone marrow involvements, sacroiliitis, spondylodiscitis and orchitis were recorded as the patients with organ involvement. After six weeks, the decline of the complaints was considered as a clinical response. In the 6th week of the treatment, it was observed that platelet distribution width (PDW) and mean platelet volume (MPV) levels were lower in patients with a clinical response compared to the patients with no clinical response which was statistically significant (p= 0.01, p= 0.02). Platelet and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) level in patients with organ involvement in the 1st and 6th weeks of the treatment, were observed to be lower than the patients without organ involvement which was statistically significant (week 1: p= 0.001, p= 0.01; week 6: p= 0.03, p= 0.01). Among patients with organ involvement and non-organ involvement, the area under the curve was 66% in the ROC curve analysis for PLR at the onset of the treatment. When the cut-off value was taken as 128.8%, the sensitivity was 55%, and the specificity was 78%.

In bacteria, this process is accomplished by multidomain sensor histidine kinases that undergo autophosphorylation in response to specific stimuli, thereby triggering downstream signaling cascades. However, the molecular mechanism of allosteric activation is not fully understood in these important sensor proteins. Here, we report the full-length crystal structure of a blue light photoreceptor LOV histidine kinase (LOV-HK) involved in light-dependent virulence modulation in the pathogenic bacterium Brucella abortus Joint analyses of dark and light structures determined in different signaling states have shown that LOV-HK transitions from a symmetric dark structure to a highly asymmetric light state. The initial local and subtle structural signal originated in the chromophore-binding LOV domain alters the dimer asymmetry via a coiled-coil rotary switch and helical bending in the helical spine. These amplified structural changes result in enhanced conformational flexibility and large-scale rearrangements that facilitate the phosphoryl transfer reaction in the HK domain.IMPORTANCE Bacteria employ two-component systems (TCSs) to sense and respond to changes in their surroundings. At the core of the TCS signaling pathway is the multidomain sensor histidine kinase, where the enzymatic activity of its output domain is allosterically controlled by the input signal perceived by the sensor domain. Here, we examine the structures and dynamics of a naturally occurring light-sensitive histidine kinase from the pathogen Brucella abortus in both its full-length and its truncated constructs. Direct comparisons between the structures captured in different signaling states have revealed concerted protein motions in an asymmetric dimer framework in response to light.

From ocean fishes and marine mammals, to pond dwelling amphibians, forest foxes, desert rodents, and cave-dwelling bats, Brucella have revealed a variety of previously unknown niches. Classical microbiological techniques have been able to help us classify many of these new strains but at times have limited our ability to see the true relationships among or within species. The closest relatives of Brucella are soil bacteria and the adaptations of Brucella spp. to live intracellularly suggest that the genus has evolved to live in vertebrate hosts. Several recently discovered species appear to have phenotypes that are intermediate between soil bacteria and core Brucella, suggesting that they may represent ancestral traits that were subsequently lost in the traditional species. Remarkably, the broad relationships among Brucella species using a variety of sequence and fragment-based approaches have been upheld when using comparative genomics with whole genomes. Nonetheless, genomes are required for fine-scale resolution of many of the relationships and for understanding the evolutionary history of the genus.

Through cross-sectional studies from suspected human population with associated risk factors for zoonotic diseases, the seropositivity of brucellosis (1.83-11%), listeriosis (1.01-10.18 %), leptospirosis (8.14-12.67%) and scrub typhus (1.78-20.34%) was recorded. The investigations on scrub typhus indicated bimodal pattern during the months of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season with a peak in post-monsoon in human cases. Ornithonyssus bacoti mites were identified from the rodents as a vector harbouring Orientia tsutsugamushi. The bovine tuberculosis was detected in 1.43 per cent human cases employing molecular assay. Interpretation & conclusions: The data indicated the occurrence of important zoonotic diseases adversely affecting the livestock health and human wellbeing.

Fifty heifers calves were enrolled [38 Gyr (Zebu, Bos taurus indicus) and 12 5/8 Holstein x Gyr]. At 120 days of age, animals were randomly distributed among three groups: B (n = 18), vaccinated against brucellosis; C (n = 14), vaccinated against clostridia and CB (n = 18), vaccinated concomitantly for both. Rectal (RT) and thermographic temperatures were evaluated on days -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7,10, 14, and 28 relatives to the vaccination day. Feed and water intake, body weight (BW) and feeding behavior were monitored daily by an electronic feeding system. Blood was sampled on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28, relative to the vaccination day for determination of glucose (GLC) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations. Blood sampled on day 0 (pre-vaccination) and on day 28 and 42 were used to evaluate the immune response against Brucella abortus and clostridia. There was an increase in rectal temperature between the first and the third day post-vaccination in the three groups. The thermography revealed an increase of local temperature for seven days on groups B and CB. Group C had increased local temperature for a longer period, lasting for up to 14 d. Dry mater intake was reduced for groups B and CB, but no alteration was observed for group C. No alterations regarding initial BW, final BW, average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed efficiency were observed. No differences were observed for the three vaccination groups for blood parameters throughout the evaluation period. The concomitant vaccination against brucellosis and clostridia led to lower neutralizing antibody titers against epsilon toxin of C. perfringens and botulinum toxin type C of C. botulinum (C > CB > B). When cellular proliferation assay and serological tests to B. abortus were evaluated, no differences were observed between groups B and CB.

We report that bacteria extracted from infected cells at late stages (48 h post-infection) of the intracellular life cycle significantly increase their ability to multiply in new target cells. This increase depends on early interaction with the cell surface since bacteria become more adherent and penetrate more efficiently as compared to in vitro grown bacteria. At this late stage of infection, the bacterium locates within an autophagosome-like compartment, facing starving and acidic conditions. At this point, the two-component system BvrR/BvrS becomes activated, and the expression of the transcriptional regulator VjbR and the type IV secretion system VirB increased. Using bafilomycin to inhibit BvrR/BvrS activation and specific inhibitors for VjbR and VirB we showed that the BvrR/BvrS and VjbR systems correlate with the increased interaction with new host cells while the VirB system does not. Bacteria released from infected cells under natural conditions displayed the same phenotype as intracellular bacteria. We propose a model in which the B. abortus BvrR/BvrS system senses the transition from its replicative niche at the endoplasmic reticulum to the autophagosome-like exit compartment. This activation leads to the expression of VirB participating in the release of the bacterium from the cells and an increase in VjbR expression that results in a more efficient interaction with new host cells.",1098-5522 (Electronic) 0019-9567 (Linking),2021 Apr 5,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8771-3959', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4840-2426']","['IAI.00004-21 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.00004-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society for Microbiology.'],,

The present study assessed Brucella spp. isolated from aborted ovine and caprine fetuses in different parts of Iran between 2016 and 2019. It used classic and molecular methods in order to determine the Brucella species carrying higher risks of abortion complications in these animals. A total of 189 samples from 35 cases/case series from milk (16 sheep, and 8 goats), 19 abomasum content (sheep), and 146 aborted fetuses (116 sheep, and 30 goats) were bacteriologically examined. Subsequently, the resultant Brucella isolates were further characterized by phenotypic and molecular approaches. The multiplex Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Bruce-ladder) and IS711-based PCR were performed on all the extracted DNA to evaluate the presence of Brucella spp. As suggested by the obtained results, all recovered isolates from ovine and caprine abortion samples were either B. melitensis or B. abortus. An issue of concern was the implication of B. melitensis vaccine strain Rev1 in a small portion of sheep and goat abortion cases. Despite the recent B. abortus burden in ovine, aborted cases were predominantly associated with B. melitensis infections in both ovine and caprine, and B. melitensis biovar 1 was responsible for the majority of studied cases. These data and the techniques implemented in the present study can shed light on the level of implication of different Brucella species in ovine and caprine abortion in Iran.

To survive and replicate within macrophages, these bacteria must be able to withstand oxidative stresses and express the type IV secretion system (T4SS) to evade host immune responses. The extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor system is a major signal transduction mechanism in bacteria that senses environmental cues and responds by regulating gene expression. In this study, we defined an ECF sigma bcrS and its cognate anti-sigma factor abcS in Brucella melitensis M28 by conserved domain analysis and a protein interaction assay. BcrS directly activates an adjacent operon, bcrXQP, that encodes a methionine-rich peptide and a putative methionine sulfoxide reductase system, whereas AbcS is a negative regulator of bcrS and bcrXQP The bcrS/abcS and bcrXQP operons can be induced by hypochlorous acid and contribute to hypochlorous acid resistance in vitro Next, RNA sequencing analysis and genome-wide recognition sequence search identified the regulons of BcrS and AbcS. Interestingly, we found that BcrS positively influences T4SS expression in an AbcS-dependent manner and that AbcS also affects T4SS expression independently of BcrS. Last, we demonstrate that abcS is required for the maintenance of persistent infection while bcrS is dispensable in a mouse infection model. Collectively, we conclude that BcrS and AbcS influence expression of multiple genes responsible for Brucella virulence traits.Importance Brucella is a notorious intracellular pathogen that induces chronic infections in animals and humans. To survive and replicate within macrophages, these bacteria require a capacity to withstand oxidative stresses and to express the type IV secretion system (T4SS) to combat host immune responses. In this study, we characterized an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma/anti-sigma factor system that regulates resistance to reactive chlorine species and T4SS expression, thereby establishing a potential link between two crucial virulence traits of Brucella Furthermore, the anti-sigma factor AbcS contributes to Brucella persistent infection of mice.

Recently, interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) has been identified as a highly effective anti-intracellular pathogen protein that can inhibit the invasion of a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms. However, whether Brucella infection induces secretion of exosomes and whether these exosomes contain IFITM3 protein remain unknown. Here, we focused on the immune function of extracellular IFITM3 protein in the process of Brucella infection. This study is the first to show that Brucella melitensis strain M5 (Brucella M5) can stimulate macrophages to secrete large amounts of exosomes. Most importantly, we identified exosomes from Brucella M5-infected cells that were rich in molecules of IFITM3, and these exosomes could transmit the IFITM3 from one cell to another, thereby effectively inhibiting the intracellular survival of Brucella. Moreover, immunization with exosomes carrying IFITM3 decreased mouse spleen tissue damage and spleen colony forming unit (CFU), leading to the establishment of an anti-Brucella state in mice. In conclusion, our findings provide new insights into the anti-Brucella mechanism of IFITM3-containg exosomes, thus providing a theoretical foundation for systematic elaboration of the mechanisms of Brucella infection and host immunity.

However, the epidemiology of brucellosis transmission has not been fully elucidated. To characterize the infecting strains isolated from humans, multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based approaches were employed. METHODS: Strains were isolated from two males blood cultures that were confirmed Brucella melitensis positive following biotyping and MLVA. Genomic DNA was extracted from these two strains, and whole-genome sequencing was performed. Next, SNP-based phylogenetic analysis was performed to compare the two strains to 94 B. melitensis strains (complete genome and draft genome) retrieved from online databases. RESULTS: The two Brucella isolates were identified as B. melitensis biovar 3 (QH2019001 and QH2019005) following conventional biotyping and were found to have differences in their variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) using MLVA-16.

Rift Valley fever (RVF), brucellosis and Q fever are three of the top priority diseases in the country but the involvement of camels in the transmission dynamics of these diseases is poorly understood. We analyzed 120 camel serum samples from northern Kenya to establish seropositivity rates of the three pathogens and to characterize the infecting Brucella species using molecular assays. We found seropositivity of 24.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.5-31.8%) for Brucella, 20.8% (95% CI: 13.6-28.1%) and 14.2% (95% CI: 7.9-20.4%) for Coxiella burnetii and Rift valley fever virus respectively.

B. melitensis was the only Brucella spp. detected. The high sero-positivity rates are indicative of the endemicity of these pathogens among camel populations and the possible role the species has in the epidemiology of zoonotic diseases.

Because Hulun Buir relies on a nomadic livestock rearing system, brucellosis spreads easily among different animal species and humans. In Xin Barag Left Banner and Xin Barag Right Banner, the incidence rates were respectively 226.54/100 000 and 199.10/100 000, exceeding those observed in other areas. Most of the cases occurred in the (25-45)-year old group, accounting for 65.74% of the cases (15,709/23,897), and among farmers, accounting for 66.71% (15,942/23,897). The male to female incidence ratio was 2.67:1. The higher incidence in younger people and the large gender ratio reflected the unique traditional production and lifestyle of nomads. Most reported cases were observed from April to June, indicating that more than 40% of the cases were related to the delivery of domestic livestock. The biotyping showed that the 44 isolated strains were all B. melitensis, including 12 Brucella melitensis biovar (bv) 1, and 32 B. melitensis bv. 3. The strains displayed a genetic similarity of 80-100%. Our hypothesis is that human brucellosis outbreak in this region may be originating from a limited source of infection, so further investigation is necessary. The epidemic situation of human brucellosis in Hulun Buir is extremely serious, strengthened surveillance and control in animals' brucellosis should be priority.",1865-1682 (Electronic) 1865-1674 (Linking),2021 Mar 17,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4904-4878'],['10.1111/tbed.14075 [doi]'],['eng'],Germany,"['Brucella', 'Brucellosis', 'Epidemiological characteristics', 'Genotypes', 'Hulun Buir']",['This article is protected by copyright.

To establish and maintain infection, B. ovis must survive stressful conditions inside host cells, including low pH, nutrient limitation, and reactive oxygen species. These same conditions are often encountered in axenic cultures during stationary phase. Studies of stationary phase may thus inform understanding of Brucella infection biology, yet the genes and pathways that are important in Brucella stationary phase physiology remain poorly defined. We measured fitness of a barcoded pool of B. ovis Tn-himar mutants as a function of growth phase and identified cysE as a determinant of fitness in stationary phase. CysE catalyzes the first step in cysteine biosynthesis from serine, and we provide genetic evidence that two related enzymes, CysK1 and CysK2, function redundantly to catalyze cysteine synthesis at steps downstream of CysE. Deleting either cysE (DeltacysE) or both cysK1 and cysK2 (DeltacysK1 DeltacysK2) results in premature entry into stationary phase, reduced culture yield and sensitivity to exogenous hydrogen peroxide. These phenotypes can be chemically complemented by cysteine or glutathione. DeltacysE and DeltacysK1 DeltacysK2 strains have no defect in host cell entry in vitro but have significantly diminished intracellular fitness between 2 and 24 hours post infection. Our study has uncovered unexpected redundancy at the CysK step of cysteine biosynthesis in B. ovis, and demonstrates that cysteine anabolism is a determinant of peroxide stress survival and fitness in the intracellular niche.",1098-5522 (Electronic) 0019-9567 (Linking),2021 Mar 22,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0612-5029', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1727-322X']","['IAI.00808-20 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.00808-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society for Microbiology.'],,

In this work, we tested a new delivery system for mucosal immunization with BLSOmp31 in the murine model to improve the efficacy of previously used formulations. First, we evaluated the protective efficacy against B. ovis induced by BLSOmp31 administered by the subcutaneous route using either BLSOmp31 alone, co-administered with immunostimulatory synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine motifs (CpG-ODN) or with CpG-ODN in a nanostructure called Coa-ASC16 compared with BLSOmp31 emulsified in Incomplete Freund Adjuvant. Then, we evaluated the protection conferred by the best performing formulation (BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16) administered by both subcutaneous and ocular routes. BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16 injected subcutaneously did not induce higher IgG antibody levels compared to BLSOmp31 alone or BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN but it did stimulate a mixed immune Th1-Th2 response with the highest levels of IFN- and conferred significant protection against the B. ovis challenge. Although ocular instillation of BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16 showed a similar degree of protection compared to the parenteral route (3.66 and 3.60 logs of protection, respectively), it induced lower levels in serum of specific IgG (with mixed IgG1/IgG2a) and IgA antibodies and, less IFN- and IL-4 than the subcutaneous route. No antibodies were detected in vaginal lavages or saliva. Fecal antigen-specific IgA was slightly higher in mice immunized with BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16 subcutaneously compared with the ocular route.

Malaria and brucellosis co-infection or brucellosis sole infections are often missed due to an over emphasis on malaria and the lack of appropriate diagnostic infrastructure. Brucellosis in dogs is usually overlooked and yet there is extensive contact between humans and their pets. Objective: This study investigated brucellosis in children and dogs using a confirmatory serological testing series that screens for three Brucella sp. Methods: Residual blood samples from malaria smear-negative febrile children were collected and tested for Brucella sp and malaria parasite. During the same period, residual blood samples presented to a veterinary microbiology laboratory in the same area were tested for brucellosis using the same approach. Results: A total of 105 human and 80 canine blood samples were tested for brucellosis antibodies. The seroprevalence of brucellosis was 22.86% (25/105) in children and 1.3% (1/80) in dogs using the Card, buffered acidified plate antigen, and standard plate agglutination tests but was 0% using the rivanol precipitation plate agglutination test. Conclusion: Given that brucellosis can be caused by both smooth and rough colony strains, there is a need to modify the current serological surveillance strategy (targeted at only Brucella abortus and other smooth colony Brucella strains) to figure out the relative contribution of rough colony Brucella strains (B. ovis and B. canis).

Studies about the virulence mechanisms of Brucella have been mostly performed with smooth (bearing O-polysaccharide in lipopolysaccharide) zoonotic species, and those performed with B. ovis have revealed similarities but also relevant differences. Except for few strains recently isolated from unconventional hosts, Brucella species are non-motile but contain the genes required to assemble a flagellum, which are organized in three main loci of about 18.5, 6.4, and 7.8 kb. Although these loci contain different pseudogenes depending on the non-motile Brucella species, smooth B. melitensis 16M builds a sheathed flagellum under particular culture conditions and requires flagellar genes for virulence. However, nothing is known in this respect regarding other Brucella strains. In this work, we have constructed a panel of B. ovis PA mutants defective in one, two or the three flagellar loci in order to assess their role in virulence of this rough (lacking O-polysaccharide) Brucella species. No relevant differences in growth, outer membrane-related properties or intracellular behavior in cellular models were observed between flagellar mutants and the parental strain, which is in accordance with previous results with B. melitensis 16M single-gene mutants. However, contrary to these B. melitensis mutants, unable to establish a chronic infection in mice, removal of the three flagellar loci in B. ovis did not affect virulence in the mouse model.

CAs are metalloenzymes able to modulate CO2, HCO3 (-) and H(+) concentration through their crucial role in catalysis of reversible CO2 hydration (CO2 + H2O right arrow over left arrow HCO3 (-) + H(+)). In all living organisms, CA activity is linked to physiological processes, such as those related to the transport and supply of CO2 or HCO3 (-), pH homeostasis, secretion of electrolytes, biosynthetic processes and photosynthesis. These important processes cannot be ensured by the very low rate of the non-catalyzed reaction of CO2 hydration. It has been recently shown that CAs are important biomolecules for many bacteria involved in human infections, such as Vibrio cholerae, Brucella suis, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Helicobacter pylori. In these species, CA activity promotes microorganism growth and adaptation in the host, or modulates bacterial toxin production and virulence. In this review, recent literature in this research field and some of the above-mentioned issues are discussed, namely: (i) the implication of CAs from bacterial pathogens in determining the microorganism growth and virulence; (ii) the druggability of these enzymes using classical CA inhibitors (CAIs) of the sulfonamide-type as examples; (iii) the role played by Helicobacter pylori CAs in the acid tolerance/adaptation of the microbe within the human abdomen; (iv) the role of CAs played in the outer membrane vesicles spawned by H. pylori in its planktonic and biofilm phenotypes; (v) the possibility of using H. pylori CAIs in combination with probiotic strains as a novel anti-ulcer treatment approach.

Omp16, a homolog to peptidoglycan-associated lipoproteins (Pals), is essential for Brucella survival in vitro. At present, the functions of Omp16 have been poorly studied. Here, the gene expression profile of RAW264.7 cells infected with Brucella suis vaccine strain 2 (B. suis S2) and DeltaOmp16 was analyzed by RNA-seq to investigate the cellular response immediately after Brucella entry. The RNA-sequence analysis revealed that a total of 303 genes were significantly regulated by B. suis S2 24 h post-infection. Of these, 273 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were upregulated, and 30 DEGs were downregulated. These DEGs were mainly involved in innate immune signaling pathways, including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. In DeltaOmp16-infected cells, the expression of 52 total cells genes was significantly upregulated and that of 9 total cells genes were downregulated compared to B. suis S2-infected RAW264.7 cells. The KEGG pathway analysis showed that several upregulated genes were proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, IL-12beta, C-C motif chemokine (CCL2), and CCL22. All together, we clearly demonstrate that DeltaOmp16 can alter macrophage immune-related pathways to increase proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which provide insights into illuminating the Brucella pathogenic strategies.",2297-1769 (Print) 2297-1769 (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fvets.2021.646839 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['B. suis S2', 'Omp16', 'RAW264.7', 'RNA-seq', 'interactions']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhou, Zhi, Fang, Zheng, Li, Zhang, Chen, Jin and Wang.']",,

This systematic review revealed 42 prevalence studies, nine disease control articles and six articles on epidemiology. Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, Brucella inopinata and Brucella suis were reported in wildlife. The prevalence studies revealed serological evidence of brucellosis in buffalo, antelope (positive in 14/28 species), carnivores (4/12) and other species (7/20) over the last five decades. Buffalo populations were more likely to be infected and had a higher seroprevalence than other species; the pooled seroprevalence was 13.7% (95% CI 10.3-17.3%) in buffalo, 7.1% (95% CI 1.1-15.5%) in carnivores and 2.1% (95% CI 0.1-4.9%) in antelope. Wildlife in high rainfall areas (>/= 800 mm) were more likely to be infected, and infected populations showed higher seroprevalence in high rainfall areas and in studies published after 2000.

Eukaryotic BI-1 is a cytoprotective protein that suppresses cell death induced by multiple stimuli in eukaryotes. Brucella, the causative agent of brucellosis that threatens public health and animal husbandry, contains a conserved gene that encodes BI-1-like protein. To explore the role of the Brucella homolog of BI-1, BrBI, in Brucella suis S2, we constructed the brbI deletion mutant strain and its complemented strain. brbI deletion altered the membrane properties of Brucella suis S2 and decreased its resistance to acidic pH, H2O2, polymyxin B, and lincomycin. Additionally, deleting brbI led to defective growth, cell division, and viability in Brucella suis S2. We then revealed the effect of brbI deletion on the physiological characteristics of Brucella suis S2 via integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. The integrated analysis showed that brbI deletion significantly affected the expression of multiple genes at the mRNA and/or protein levels. Specifically, the affected divisome proteins, FtsB, FtsI, FtsL, and FtsQ, may be the molecular basis of the impaired cell division of the brbI mutant strain, and the extensively affected membrane proteins and transporter-associated proteins were consistent with the phenotype of the membrane properties' alterations of the brbI mutant strain.

The brucellae are related to free-living and plant-associated alpha2-Proteobacteria and, since they multiply within host cells, their metabolism probably reflects this adaptation. To investigate this, we used the rodent-associated Brucella suis biovar 5, which in contrast to the ruminant-associated Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis and other B. suis biovars, is fast-growing and conserves the ancestral Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP) present in the plant-associated relatives. We constructed mutants in Edd (glucose-6-phosphate dehydratase; first EDP step), PpdK (pyruvate phosphate dikinase; phosphoenolpyruvate right harpoon over left harpoon pyruvate), and Pyk (pyruvate kinase; phosphoenolpyruvate --> pyruvate). In a chemically defined medium with glucose as the only C source, the Edd mutant showed reduced growth rates and the triple Edd-PpdK-Pyk mutant did not grow. Moreover, the triple mutant was also unable to grow on ribose or xylose. Therefore, B. suis biovar 5 sugar catabolism proceeds through both the Pentose Phosphate shunt and EDP, and EDP absence and exclusive use of the shunt could explain at least in part the comparatively reduced growth rates of B. melitensis and B. abortus. The triple Edd-PpdK-Pyk mutant was not attenuated in mice. Thus, although an anabolic use is likely, this suggests that hexose/pentose catabolism to pyruvate is not essential for B. suis biovar 5 multiplication within host cells, a hypothesis consistent with the lack of classical glycolysis in all Brucella species and of EDP in B. melitensis and B. abortus. These results and those of previous works suggest that within cells, the brucellae use mostly 3 and 4 C substrates fed into anaplerotic pathways and only a limited supply of 5 and 6 C sugars, thus favoring the EDP loss observed in some species.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2020,,['10.3389/fmicb.2020.620049 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Brucella', 'Entner-Doudoroff', 'glucose', 'metabolism', 'virulence']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Lazaro-Anton, de Miguel, Barbier, Conde-Alvarez, Munoz,', 'Letesson, Iriarte, Moriyon and Zuniga-Ripa.']",,

MLVA data of strains were applied to the constructed Minimum Spanning Tree to explore the species/biovars distribution, geographic origins, and genetic relationships of the strains analyzed. Moreover, whole-genome sequencing-single-nucleotide polymorphism (WGS-SNP) phylogenetic analysis of the genome of Brucella melitensis strains from GenBank was performed to discriminate the relatedness of strains further and investigate the transmission pattern of B. melitensis brucellosis. A total of 1,503 Brucella strains were analyzed in this study: 431 Brucella abortus strains (29.8%), 1,009 B. melitensis strains (65.7%), and 63 Brucella suis strains (4.5%). B. melitensis biovar 3 was the dominant species and was shown to be widespread in all of the examined regions, suggesting that the prevention and surveillance of the B. melitensis population are a main challenge in these countries. A wide host spectrum was observed for this Brucella population; many animal reservoirs are a potential reason for the continuous brucellosis circulation in these countries. Although the B. abortus strains from the examined regions had common geographic origins, only a few shared genotypes were observed in different countries. These data revealed that the majority of B. abortus strains were spreading within the national borders. However, the B. melitensis strains from Italy originated from a Western Mediterranean lineage; strains from the other 10 countries originated from Eastern Mediterranean lineage, and this lineage was shared by strains from three to nine different countries, suggesting that the introduction and reintroduction of the disease in the 10 countries might have occurred in the past. Furthermore, the most shared MLVA-16 genotypes were formed in the B. melitensis strains from China, Kazakhstan, and Turkey, suggesting that the introduction and trade in sheep and goats have occurred frequently in these countries. WGS-SNP analysis showed that the B. melitensis in this study originated from the Malta (Italy) region. According to their territorial affiliation between four clade strains from these countries in genotype B, the absence of a clear differentiation suggests that strains continuously expand and spread in countries along with Silk Road. Active exchange and trade of animals (sheep and goats) among these countries are reasonable explanations. B. suis strains from different nations showed unique geographic origins and epidemiological characteristics.

Insect gut structure and gut microbiota play crucial roles in various life activities. Despite a few reports in nutrition and survival, an extensive study on the S. noctilio larval gut microbiome is lacking. We studied the gut structure using a stereo microscope and used high throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions to investigate gut microbiota in different developmental stages of S. noctilio, including larvae, adults, and larval frass. We used PICRUSt2 to predict the functional profiles. The larval gut was thin and thread-like from the oral cavity to the anus, carrying few xylem particles in the crop. Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, and Burkholderia s.l were the dominant bacteria in the guts of larvae, adults, and frass, respectively. Even though Pseudomonas was the most abundant among all bacteria, Zoogloea, Ruminobacter, and Nitrosospira, which might be involved in degrading organic matter and fixing nitrogen occurred exclusively in the larval gut indicating their possible role in the growth and development of larvae in pine tree xylem. Fungal communities did not change significantly across different developmental stages or the frass. Amylostereum was dominant in the woodwasp's larval gut. Functional prediction of bacterial and fungal communities revealed that they may encod enzymes involved in degrading lignocellulose and fixing nitrogen. Ours is the first study that compares gut microbial communities present in S. noctilio larvae, adults, and frass. This study could provide an understanding of larval nutrient acquisition in nutrient-deficient host xylem to some extent.

The objectives of the study was to compare the airway microbiome in LTx patients with and without ongoing airway infection and identify differences in their microbiome composition. METHODS: LTx recipients were prospectively followed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during the first year after transplantation. The likelihood of airway infection at the time of sampling was graded based on clinical criteria and BAL cultures, and BAL fluid levels of the inflammatory markers heparin-binding protein (HBP), IL-1beta and IL-8 were determined with ELISA. The bacterial microbiome of the samples were analysed with 16S rDNA sequencing and characterized based on richness and evenness. The distance in microbiome composition between samples were determined using Bray-Curtis and weighted and unweighted UniFrac. RESULTS: A total of 46 samples from 22 patients were included in the study. Samples collected during infection and samples with high levels of inflammation were characterized by loss of bacterial diversity and a significantly different species composition. Burkholderia, Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus were enriched during infection and inflammation, whereas anaerobes and normal oropharyngeal flora were less abundant.

Biosynthesis of FVG is dependent on the gvg biosynthetic gene cluster in P. fluorescens.

These strains primarily belong to two groups of Pseudomonas, P. fluorescens and P. syringae, however, a few strains with the gvg cluster were found outside of Pseudomonas. Mass spectrometry confirmed that all tested strains of the P. fluorescens species group produced FVG. However, P. syringae strains did not produce FVG under standard conditions. Several lines of evidence regarding the transmission of the gvg cluster including a robust phylogenetic analysis suggest that it was introduced multiple times through horizontal gene transfer within the Pseudomonas lineage as well as in select lineages of Thiomonas, Burkholderia and Pantoea.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 841 bacterial isolates was obtained using selective and enrichment isolation methods. ACC deaminase was investigated using in vitro methods and by sequencing the acdS gene. The effect of ACC deaminase on P solubilisation was investigated further using five efficient PSB. ACC deaminase production ability was found among a wide range of bacteria belonging to the genera Bacillus, Burkholderia, Pseudomonas and Variovorax. The amount of ACC deaminase produced by PSB was significantly associated with the liberation of Pi from Ca-P when ACC was the sole N source. Ca-P solubilisation was associated with the degree of acidification of the medium. Additionally, the P solubilisation potential of PSB with (NH4 )2 SO4 was determined by the type of carboxylates produced. An in-planta experiment was conducted using Burkholderia sp. 12F on chickpea cv.

A previous study reported molecular detection of this bacterium in several specimens of the common bed bug (Cimex lectularius L.) collected from an elderly care facility in the U.S.A., raising questions about the possibility of vector-borne transmission. However, the ability of B. multivorans to colonize bed bugs and the ability of bed bugs to transmit the bacteria both remained untested. To resolve this knowledge gap, here we performed a set of experiments to examine the persistence and shedding of B. multivorans following ingestion by bed bugs in a blood meal. We isolated viable B. multivorans from the bodies of bed bugs for up to 13 days post-ingestion, but bacterial load substantially diminished over time. By 16 days post-ingestion, the bacteria could not be isolated. Further, B. multivorans was not shed in the saliva of infected bugs during feeding nor was it transmitted vertically from infected insects to their progeny. Based on these results, significant biological or mechanical transmission of B. multivorans to humans by bed bugs appears unlikely. Nonetheless, some viable bacteria were passively shed into the environment through defecation, a process which could potentially contribute to transmission through indirect contamination under rare circumstances.",1365-2915 (Electronic) 0269-283X (Linking),2021 Apr 21,,['10.1111/mve.12520 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Bed bug', 'Burkholderia', 'cimex', 'infection', 'pathogen']",['(c) 2021 The Royal Entomological Society.'],,

It is difficult to diagnose this zoonotic disease in its early stages. Some methods such as the complement fixation test (CFT) cause some problems for veterinary authorities and financial losses to animal owners due to false-positive results. The mallein test requires appropriate laboratory equipment and skilled personnel. To quickly and accurately diagnose the disease, especially in areas where animals cannot be kept, new methods (such as the Western blot test [WBT]) should be used to identify the disease. This study designed and optimized the Western blot (immunoblot) test using sera from 84 glanderous equids, and the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA and CFT were compared with the WBT. ELISA tests are based on B. mallei antigens whereas a purified lipopolysaccharide-containing B. mallei antigen is used in the WBT. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests were estimated using the cut-off values recommended by the test developers. The WBT and ELISA were significantly more specific than the CFT. The ELISA based on B. mallei antigens was significantly less sensitive than the CFT. Given their comparable sensitivities and specificities, the CFT (95.7%, 98.5%), the WBT (95%, 100%) and the ELISA (85%, 100%) should be further developed. The CFT is still the prescribed technique for serological investigation of equids for trade purposes to certify individual animals without glanders.

Clinical manifestations of B. pseudomallei infection range from acute or chronic localized infection in a single organ to fulminant septicaemia in multiple organs. The diverse clinical manifestations are attributed to various factors, including the genome plasticity across B. pseudomallei strains. We previously characterized B. pseudomallei strains isolated in Malaysia and noted different levels of virulence in model hosts. We hypothesized that the difference in virulence might be a result of variance at the genome level. In this study, we sequenced and assembled four Malaysian clinical B. pseudomallei isolates, UKMR15, UKMPMC2000, UKMD286 and UKMH10. Phylogenomic analysis showed that Malaysian subclades emerged from the Asian subclade, suggesting that the Malaysian strains originated from the Asian region. Interestingly, the low-virulence strain, UKMH10, was the most distantly related compared to the other Malaysian isolates. Genomic island (GI) prediction analysis identified a new island of 23 kb, GI9c, which is present in B. pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei, but not Burkholderia thailandensis. Genes encoding known B. pseudomallei virulence factors were present across all four genomes, but comparative analysis of the total gene content across the Malaysian strains identified 104 genes that are absent in UKMH10. We propose that these genes may encode novel virulence factors, which may explain the reduced virulence of this strain. Further investigation on the identity and role of these 104 proteins may aid in understanding B. pseudomallei pathogenicity to guide the design of new therapeutics for treating melioidosis.",2057-5858 (Electronic) 2057-5858 (Linking),2021 Feb,,['10.1099/mgen.0.000527 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['*Burkholderia pseudomallei', '*comparative genomics', '*genomic island', '*virulence factors']",,,

Here, we exploited this system to construct and evaluate a diagnostic tool for glanders. Burkholderia mallei, the causative agent of glanders, is a highly infectious and fatal zoonotic pathogen that infects horses, mules, donkeys, and occasionally humans. A highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool is crucial for the control, elimination, and eradication of B. mallei infections. We constructed plasmids carrying synthetic genes encoding a modified, previously unannotated Burkholderia glycoprotein containing three glycosylation sequons fused to the cholera toxin B-subunit. The resulting proteins were glycosylated in the B. cenocepacia K56-2 parental strain, but not in glycosylation-deficient mutants, as determined by SDS-PAGE and fluorescent lectin blots. One of these glycoproteins was used as an antigen in ELISA and western blots to screen a panel of serum samples collected from glanders-infected and healthy horses, which were previously investigated by complement fixation test and indirect ELISA based on a semi-purified fraction of B. mallei. We show that ELISA and western blot assays based on our glycoprotein antigen provide 100% specificity, with a sensitivity greater than 88%. The glycoprotein antigen was recognized by serum samples collected from patients infected with B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, B. multivorans, and B. cenocepacia.

Burkholderia is a genus of Gram-negative, non-sporulating bacteria. While ubiquitous and capable of growing within plants and groundwater, they are primarily soil-dwelling organisms. These include the more virulent forms of Burkholderia such as Burkholderia mallei, Burkholderia pseudomallei, and the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). Areas covered: This review provides a synopsis of current research on the natural products isolated from the genus Burkholderia. The authors also cover the research on the drug discovery efforts that have been performed on the natural products derived from Burkholderia. Expert opinion: Though Burkholderia has a small number of pathogenic species, the majority of the genus is avirulent and almost all members of the genus are capable of producing useful antimicrobial products that could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutics against infectious diseases. The need for discovery of new antibiotics is urgent due to the ever-increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, coupled with the decline in the discovery of new antibiotics.",1746-045X (Electronic) 1746-0441 (Linking),2021 Jan 29,,['10.1080/17460441.2021.1877655 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Burkholderia', 'antibiotics', 'antifungals', 'antimicrobial Resistance', 'cyclic lipopeptides', 'drug Discovery', 'natural Products', 'occidiofungin', 'ornibactin', 'siderophores']",,,

Regarded as the only pathogenic members of this group, B. pseudomallei and B. mallei cause the diseases melioidosis and glanders, respectively. Additionally, variant strains of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis exist that include the geographically restricted B. pseudomallei that express a B. mallei-like BimA protein (BPBM), and B. thailandensis that express a B. pseudomallei-like capsular polysaccharide (BTCV). To establish a PCR-based assay for the detection of pathogenic Burkholderia species or their variants, five PCR primers were designed to amplify species-specific sequences within the bimA (Burkholderia intracellular motility A) gene. Our multiplex PCR assay could distinguish pathogenic B. pseudomallei and BPBM from the non-pathogenic B. thailandensis and the BTCV strains. A second singleplex PCR successfully discriminated the BTCV from B. thailandensis. Apart from B. humptydooensis, specificity testing against other Burkholderia spp., as well as other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria produced a negative result. The detection limit of the multiplex PCR in soil samples artificially spiked with known quantities of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis were 5 and 6 CFU/g soil, respectively. Furthermore, comparison between standard bacterial culture and the multiplex PCR to detect B. pseudomallei from 34 soil samples, collected from an endemic area of melioidosis, showed high sensitivity and specificity. This robust, sensitive, and specific PCR assay will be a useful tool for epidemiological study of B. pseudomallei and closely related members with pathogenic potential in soil.",1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),2021,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8878-8837', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4732-0733']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0245175 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-27523 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

Here, we report the development and evaluation of a bacteriophage tail fiber-based latex agglutination assay for rapid detection of B. pseudomallei infection. Burkholderia phage E094 was isolated from rice paddy fields in northeast Thailand, and whole genome sequenced to identify its tail fiber (94TF). The 94TF complex was structurally characterized, which involved identification of a tail assembly protein that forms an essential component of the mature fiber. Recombinant 94TF was conjugated to latex beads and developed into an agglutination-based assay (94TF-LAA). 94TF-LAA was initially tested against a large library of Burkholderia and other bacterial strains before a field evaluation was performed during routine clinical testing. The sensitivity and specificity of the 94TF-LAA were assessed alongside standard biochemical analyses on 300 patient specimens collected from an endemic area of melioidosis over 11 months. The 94TF-LAA took less than 5 minutes to produce positive agglutination, demonstrating 98% (95% CI; 94.2%-99.59%) sensitivity and 83% (95% CI; 75.64%-88.35%) specificity when compared to biochemical-based detection. Overall, we show how a Burkholderia-specific phage tail fiber can be exploited for rapid detection of B. pseudomallei The 94TF-LAA has the potential for further development as a supplementary diagnostic to assist in clinical identification of this life-threatening pathogen.IMPORTANCERapid diagnosis of melioidosis is essential for ensuring optimal antibiotic courses are prescribed to patients, and thus warrants the development of cost-effective and easy-to-use tests for implementation in under-resourced areas such as Northeast Thailand and other tropical regions. Phage tail fibers are an interesting alternative to antibodies for use in various diagnostic assays for different pathogenic bacteria. As exposed appendages of phages, tail fibers are physically robust, easy to manufacture, and critically many tail fibers (such as 94TF investigated here) can target a given bacterial species with remarkable specificity. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a latex agglutination assay using a Burkholderia-specific tail fiber 94TF against biochemical-based detection methods that are the standard diagnostic in many endemic areas of meilodosis.",1098-5336 (Electronic) 0099-2240 (Linking),2021 Apr 2,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3906-7379', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8162-2631', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1401-2171']","['AEM.03019-20 [pii]', '10.1128/AEM.03019-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Muangsombut et al.'],,

It is endemic in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, but it is underreported in many other countries. The principal routes of entry for B. pseudomallei are skin penetration, inhalation, and ingestion. It mainly affects immunocompromised populations, especially patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The laboratory diagnosis of melioidosis is challenging due to its non-specific clinical manifestations, which mimic other severe infections. The culture method is considered an imperfect gold standard for the diagnosis of melioidosis due to its low sensitivity. Antibody detection has low sensitivity and specificity due to the high seropositivity among healthy people in endemic regions. Antigen detection using various proteins has been tested for the rapid determination of B. pseudomallei; however, it presents certain limitations in terms of its sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, this review aims to frame the present knowledge of a potential target known as the Burkholderia invasion protein D (BipD), including future directions for its detection using an aptamer-based sensor (aptasensor).",2076-2607 (Print) 2076-2607 (Linking),2021 Mar 30,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2053-0546', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9422-005X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7850-6405']","['microorganisms9040711 [pii]', '10.3390/microorganisms9040711 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['B. pseudomallei', 'BipD', 'aptasensor', 'melioidosis']",,,

It is the causative agent of melioidosis, a disease that is believed to kill 89,000 people per year. It is naturally resistant to many antibiotics, requiring at least two weeks of intravenous treatment with ceftazidime, imipenem or meropenem followed by 6 months of orally delivered co-trimoxazole. This places a large treatment burden on the predominantly middle-income nations where the majority of disease occurs. We have established a high-throughput assay for compounds that could be used as a co-therapy to potentiate the effect of ceftazidime, using the related non-pathogenic bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis as a surrogate. Optimization of the assay gave a Z' factor of 0.68. We screened a library of 61,250 compounds and identified 29 compounds with a pIC50 (-log10(IC50)) greater than five. Detailed investigation allowed us to down select to six ""best in class"" compounds, which included the licensed drug chloroxine. Co-treatment of B. thailandensis with ceftazidime and chloroxine reduced culturable cell numbers by two orders of magnitude over 48 hours, compared to treatment with ceftazidime alone. Hit expansion around chloroxine was performed using commercially available compounds. Minor modifications to the structure abolished activity, suggesting that chloroxine likely acts against a specific target. Finally, an initial study demonstrates the utility of chloroxine to act as a co-therapy to potentiate the effect of ceftazidime against B. pseudomallei. This approach successfully identified potential co-therapies for a recalcitrant Gram-negative bacterial species.

Characterized by its siderophore catechol-moiety, CFDC uses a ""trojan-horse approach"" to navigate through the bacterial periplasmic space, thus evading various beta-lactam degrading enzymes and other mechanisms of resistance present in Gram-negative bacteria. More specifically in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, CFDC has been shown to have activity against extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), such as CTX-type, SHV-type, and TEM-type, as well as the Ambler classes of beta-lactamases, including class A (KPC), class B (NDM, IMP, and VIM), class C (AmpC), and class D (OXA, OXA-24, OXA-48, and OXA-48-like). In addition to the strong activity that CFDC has been shown to have against MDR P. aeruginosa, it has also displayed activity against the OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA-51, beta-lactamases commonly found in MDR A. baumannii. Cefiderocol was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, for use in patients 18 years or older with limited or no alternative options for treatment, and is currently being evaluated in a phase III trial for use in nosocomial pneumonia caused by Gram-negative pathogens.

Results: Increased expression of ampC gene showed significant association with reduced susceptibility to chloramphenicol.

Species within the Bcc are widely distributed within the environment, can survive in the presence of disinfectants and antiseptics, and are inherently multidrug resistant (MDR). METHODS: Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) patients with a B. cepacia positive blood culture between 20 October 2016 to 23rd September 2017 were considered as outbreak cases. Blood stream infections (BSIs) were detected using BacT/ALERT 3D at DMCH. B. cepacia was isolated on chromogenic UTI media followed by MALDI-TOF. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clinically relevant antibiotics was determined by agar dilution. Whole genome sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Patients' demographic and clinical data were collected. Patients' clinical history and genomic data of the outbreak strains were merged to investigate possible outbreaks. Ninety-one B. cepacia genomes were downloaded from 'Burkholderia Genome Database' and the genomic background of the global strains were compared with our outbreak strains. RESULTS: Among 236 BSIs, 6.35% (15/236) were B. cepacia. Outbreak cases were confined to the burn critical care unit and, to a lesser extent, the paediatrics department. There was a continuum of overlapping cases at DMCH between 23 October 2016 to 30 August 2017. Core genome SNPs showed that the outbreak strains were confined to a single clade, corresponded to a common clone (ST1578). The strains were shown to be MDR and associated with a mortality of 31% excluding discharge against medical advice. MIC profiles of the strains suggested that antibiotics deployed as empirical therapy were invariably inappropriate. The genetic background of the outbreak strains was very similar; however, a few variations were found regarding the presence of virulence genes. Compared to global strains from the Burkholderia Genome Database, the Bangladeshi strains were genetically distinct. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental surveillance is required to investigate the aetiology and mode of transmission of the B. cepacia outbreak.

A possible treatment for chronic infections arises from the existence of collateral sensitivity (CS)-acquired resistance to a treatment antibiotic results in a decreased resistance to a nontreatment antibiotic. Determining CS patterns for bacteria involved in chronic infections may lead to sustainable treatment regimens that reduce development of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. CS has been found to occur in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we report that B. multivorans exhibits antibiotic CS, as well as cross-resistance (CR), describe CS and CR networks for six antibiotics (ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, meropenem, minocycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and identify candidate genes involved in CS.

As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, the principal antibacterial/bactericidal activity of cefiderocol occurs by inhibition of Gram-negative bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin binding proteins; however, it is unique in that it enters the bacterial periplasmic space as a result of its siderophore-like property and has enhanced stability to beta-lactamases. The chemical structure of cefiderocol is similar to both ceftazidime and cefepime, which are third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, respectively, but with high stability to a variety of beta-lactamases, including AmpC and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Cefiderocol has a pyrrolidinium group in the side chain at position 3 like cefepime and a carboxypropanoxyimino group in the side chain at position 7 of the cephem nucleus like ceftazidime. The major difference in the chemical structures of cefiderocol, ceftazidime and cefepime is the presence of a catechol group on the side chain at position 3. Together with the high stability to beta-lactamases, including ESBLs, AmpC and carbapenemases, the microbiological activity of cefiderocol against aerobic Gram-negative bacilli is equal to or superior to that of ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem, and it is active against a variety of Ambler class A, B, C and D beta-lactamases. Cefiderocol is also more potent than both ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem versus Acinetobacter baumannii, including meropenem non-susceptible and multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Cefiderocol's activity against meropenem-non-susceptible and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriales is comparable or superior to ceftazidime-avibactam. Cefiderocol is also more potent than both ceftazidime-avibactam and meropenem against all resistance phenotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The current dosing regimen being used in phase III studies is 2 g administered intravenously every 8 h (q8 h) using a 3-h infusion. The pharmacokinetics of cefiderocol are best described by a three-compartment linear model. The mean plasma half-life (t(1/2)) was ~ 2.3 h, protein binding is 58%, and total drug clearance ranged from 4.6-6.0 L/h for both single- and multi-dose infusions and was primarily renally excreted unchanged (61-71%). Cefiderocol is primarily renally excreted unchanged and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustment is thus required for both augmented renal clearance and in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies have reported that as with other cephalosporins the pharmacodynamic index that best predicts clinical outcome is the percentage of time that free drug concentrations exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (%fT > MIC). In vivo efficacy of cefiderocol has been studied in a variety of humanized drug exposure murine and rat models of infection utilizing a variety of MDR and extremely drug resistant strains. Cefiderocol has performed similarly to or has been superior to comparator agents, including ceftazidime and cefepime. A phase II prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial assessed the safety and efficacy of cefiderocol 2000 mg q8 h versus imipenem/cilastatin 1000 mg q8 h, both administered intravenously for 7-14 days over 1 h, in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI, including pyelonephritis) or acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in hospitalized adults. A total of 452 patients were initially enrolled in the study, with 303 in the cefiderocol arm and 149 in the imipenem/cilastatin arm. The primary outcome measure was a composite of clinical cure and microbiological eradication at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit, that is, 7 days after the end of treatment in the microbiological intent-to-treat (MITT) population. Secondary outcome measures included microbiological response per pathogen and per patient at early assessment (EA), end of treatment (EOT), TOC, and follow-up (FUP); clinical response per pathogen and per patient at EA, EOT, TOC, and FUP; plasma, urine and concentrations of cefiderocol; and the number of participants with adverse events. The composite of clinical and microbiological response rates was 72.6% (183/252) for cefiderocol and 54.6% (65/119) for imipenem/cilastatin in the MITT population. Clinical response rates per patient at the TOC visit were 89.7% (226/252) for cefiderocol and 87.4% (104/119) for imipenem/cilastatin in the MITT population. Microbiological eradication rates were 73.0% (184/252) for cefiderocol and 56.3% (67/119) for imipenem/cilastatin in the MITT population. Additionally, two phase III clinical trials are currently being conducted by Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Japan. The two trials are evaluating the efficacy of cefiderocol in the treatment of serious infections in adult patients caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens and evaluating the efficacy of cefiderocol in the treatment of adults with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia or healthcare-associated pneumonia caused by Gram-negative pathogens. Cefiderocol appears to be well tolerated (minor reported adverse effects were gastrointestinal and phlebitis related), with a side effect profile that is comparable to other cephalosporin antimicrobials. Cefiderocol appears to be well positioned to help address the increasing number of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant and MDR Gram-negative bacilli, including ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing strains (including metallo-beta-lactamase producers).

Iron-depleted cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth (ID-CAMHB), prepared according to a recently approved (2017), but not yet published, CLSI protocol, was used to test cefiderocol; all other antimicrobial agents were tested using CAMHB. The concentration of cefiderocol inhibiting 90% (MIC90) of isolates of carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae was 4 mug/ml; cefiderocol MICs ranged from 0.004 to 32 mug/ml, and 97.0% (991/1,022) of isolates demonstrated cefiderocol MICs of </=4 mug/ml. The MIC90s for cefiderocol for MDR A. baumannii, MDR P. aeruginosa, and S. maltophilia were 8, 1, and 0.25 mug/ml, respectively, with 89.7% (330/368), 99.2% (260/262), and 100% (217/217) of isolates demonstrating cefiderocol MICs of </=4 mug/ml.

They are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, excess hospitalization and financial costs. The present study is an attempt to investigate the spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates involved in healthcare associated infections (HCAI) in the patients of a critical care unit at a tertiary care university hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. METHODS: A laboratory based study was conducted over the period of 15 months (January 2014 to March 2015) among the patients of intensive care unit of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. Clinical specimens from patients with suspected healthcare-associated infection were processed and bacterial isolates were identified with standard microbiological methods. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isolated strains were determined according to the CLSI guidelines and beta-lactamases (ESBL, AmpC, MBL and KPC) were detected by various phenotypic tests. RESULTS: One hundred and forty nine clinical specimens received from 135 patients suspected of HCAI (out of 491 patients) were found with significant bacterial growth. Specimens were from patients suspected of hospital-acquired pneumonia (16%, 79/491), bloodstream infections (5.7%, 28/491), surgical site infections (4.7%, 23/491), and urinary tract infections (3.9%, 19/491). Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli and Burkholderia cepacia were the leading bacterial pathogens. Extremely high level of drug resistance (95.8%) along with the production of beta-lactamases (ESBL; 43.7%, AmpC; 27.5%), MBL; 50.2% and KPC; 4.2%) was observed among Gram negative bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: Healthcare associated infections are very common in our ICU. Gram negative bacterial pathogens are major culprits associated with these infections and there is alarming state of drug resistance among these isolates. Continuous surveillance and establishment of preventive and control measures of healthcare associated infections are urgently needed in our setting.",2047-2994 (Electronic) 2047-2994 (Linking),2017,,"['10.1186/s13756-017-0222-z [doi]', '222 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Healthcare associated infections', 'ICU', 'MDR bacteria', 'Nepal', 'beta-lactamases']",,,

While analyzing Cas9-RNA complexes from Campylobacter jejuni, we discovered tracrRNA hybridizing to cellular RNAs, leading to formation of ""noncanonical"" crRNAs capable of guiding DNA targeting by Cas9. Our discovery inspired the engineering of reprogrammed tracrRNAs that link the presence of any RNA-of-interest to DNA targeting with different Cas9 orthologs. This capability became the basis for a multiplexable diagnostic platform termed LEOPARD (Leveraging Engineered tracrRNAs and On-target DNAs for PArallel RNA Detection).

The purpose of this study was to characterize the microbiological signatures of a latent class analysis (LCA)-derived periodontal stratification system, the Periodontal Profile Class (PPC) taxonomy. We used demographic, microbial (subgingival biofilm composition), and immunological data (serum IgG antibody levels, obtained with checkerboard immunoblotting technique) for 1,450 adult participants of the Dental Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, with already generated PPC classifications. Analyses relied on t tests and generalized linear models with Bonferroni correction. Men and African Americans had higher systemic antibody levels against most microorganisms compared to women and Caucasians (P < 0.05). Healthy individuals (PPC-I) had low levels of biofilm bacteria and serum IgG levels against most periodontal pathogens (P < 0.05). Subjects with mild to moderate disease (PPC-II to PPC-III) showed mild/moderate colonization of multiple biofilm pathogens. Individuals with severe disease (PPC-IV) had moderate/high levels of biofilm pathogens and antibody levels for orange/red complexes. High gingival index individuals (PPC-V) showed moderate/high levels of biofilm Campylobacter rectus and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Biofilm composition in individuals with reduced periodontium (PPC-VI) was similar to health but showed moderate to high antibody responses. Those with severe tooth loss (PPC-VII) had significantly high levels of multiple biofilm pathogens, while the systemic antibody response to these microorganisms was comparable to health. The results support a biologic basis for elevated risk for periodontal disease in men and African Americans. Periodontally healthy individuals showed a low biofilm pathogen and low systemic antibody burden. In the presence of PPC disease, a microbial-host imbalance characterized by higher microbial biofilm colonization and/or systemic IgG responses was identified. These results support the notion that subgroups identified by the PPC system present distinct microbial profiles and may be useful in designing future precise biological treatment interventions.",1544-0591 (Electronic) 0022-0345 (Linking),2021 Apr 27,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0610-3193', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1290-7251', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5415-8311']",['10.1177/00220345211009767 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['adaptive immunity', 'biofilm', 'dysbiosis', 'periodontitis', 'race factors', 'sex characteristics']",,,

In addition to contribute to the sensory characteristics, marinates can inactivate food microorganism as well. The purpose of this study was to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the effect of marinades on meats and important food pathogens. Using a systematic review of literature, different types of marinades were evaluated, identifying its ingredients, concentrations, temperature, marinating time and their effect on Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter and Vibrio. Findings demonstrated that the use of marinades on meats not only prevents the growth of pathogens but also inactivates food pathogens. Most marinades were able to reduce < 3 log CFU/g of pathogens, and Vibrio populations demonstrated the highest reductions (> 4 log CFU/g). The pH was the most pronounced parameter influencing the pathogens inactivation, however, ingredients and storage temperature also affected pathogen reduction in marinades.",1549-7852 (Electronic) 1040-8398 (Linking),2021 Apr 27,,['10.1080/10408398.2021.1916734 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['Food processing', 'gastronomy', 'marinating', 'marination']",,,

Considering the significant contribution of ruminants as reservoirs of resistant Campylobacter, Illumina whole-genome sequencing was used to characterise the mechanisms of AMR in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli recovered from beef cattle, dairy cattle, and sheep in northern Spain. Genome analysis showed extensive genetic diversity that clearly separated both species. Resistance genotypes were identified by screening assembled sequences with BLASTn and ABRicate, and additional sequence alignments were performed to search for frameshift mutations and gene modifications. A high correlation was observed between phenotypic resistance to a given antimicrobial and the presence of the corresponding known resistance genes. Detailed sequence analysis allowed us to detect the recently described mosaic tet(O/M/O) gene in one C. coli, describe possible new alleles of blaOXA-61-like genes, and decipher the genetic context of aminoglycoside resistance genes, as well as the plasmid/chromosomal location of the different AMR genes and their implication for resistance spread.

While no non-human model is ever perfect, inexpensive in vivo small animal models in such as mice are often of great help in assessing the relevant efficacy of potential interventions. In addition to acute diarrhea, the long-term growth and developmental effects of enteric infections, with or without overt diarrhea, are increasingly recognized. To address these diverse effects, inexpensive animal models are proving to be very helpful. Herein, we review the major clinical concerns with enteric parasitic and bacterial infections that are extremely common worldwide, especially in vulnerable young children living in impoverished areas, and the recently published murine models of these infections and their outcomes. We find that common dietary deficiencies seen in children in developing areas have striking effects on diarrhea and enteropathy outcomes in mice. However, these effects differ with different pathogens. Specifically, the effects of protein or zinc deficiency differ considerably with different major protozoal and bacterial pathogens, suggesting different pathogenetic pathways and intervention effects. The pathogens reviewed are the seven top parasitic and bacterial pathogens seen in children, namely, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Campylobacter, Shigella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC).",2373-8227 (Electronic) 2373-8227 (Linking),2021 Apr 26,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9281-085X'],['10.1021/acsinfecdis.0c00831 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['animal models', 'cognitive development', 'diarrhea', 'enteropathy', 'inflammation', 'stunting']",,,

The water samples were filtered through a 0.45 mum membrane filter using vacuum pump pressure and plated on selective agar for the bacteria under test. The number of colonies of the bacterial growth observed after the incubation period was counted and recorded. The physicochemical properties of the water were determined using standard methods. The risk of Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium and Campylobacter infections resulting from the ingestion of water from the borehole and well was estimated. The results showed that the levels of enteric bacteria in the borehole were higher than those in the well.

The exterior cell surface of C. jejuni is coated with a capsular polysaccharide (CPS) that is essential for the maintenance and integrity of the bacterial cell wall and evasion of the host immune response. The identity and sequences of the monosaccharide components of the CPS are quite variable and dependent on the specific strain of C. jejuni. It is currently thought that the immediate precursor for the multiple variations found in the heptose moieties of the C. jejuni CPS is GDP-d-glycero-alpha-d-manno-heptose. In C. jejuni NCTC 11168, the heptose moiety is d-glycero-l-gluco-heptose. It has previously been shown that Cj1427 catalyzes the oxidation of GDP-d-glycero-alpha-d-manno-heptose to GDP-d-glycero-4-keto-alpha-d-lyxo-heptose using alpha-ketoglutarate as a cosubstrate. Cj1430 was now demonstrated to catalyze the double epimerization of this product at C3 and C5 to form GDP-d-glycero-4-keto-beta-l-xylo-heptose. Cj1428 subsequently catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of this GDP-linked heptose by NADPH to form GDP-d-glycero-beta-l-gluco-heptose. The three-dimensional crystal structure of Cj1430 was determined to a resolution of 1.85 A in the presence of bound GDP-d-glycero-beta-l-gluco-heptose, a product analogue. The structure shows that it belongs to the cupin superfamily. The three-dimensional crystal structure of Cj1428 was solved in the presence of NADPH to a resolution of 1.50 A. Its fold places it into the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Typically, members in this family display a characteristic signature sequence of YXXXK, with the conserved tyrosine serving a key role in catalysis.

Since the oral cavity is the entry port and the first component of the gastrointestinal system, the oral cavity has been discussed as a potential reservoir of H. pylori. Accordingly, a potential oral-oral transmission route of H. pylori raises the question concerning whether close contact such as kissing or sharing a meal can cause the transmission of H. pylori. Therefore, this topic has been investigated in many studies, applying different techniques for detection of H. pylori from oral samples, i.e. molecular techniques, immunological or biochemical methods and traditional culture techniques. While molecular, immunological or biochemical methods usually yield high detection rates, there is no definitive evidence that H. pylori has ever been isolated from the oral cavity. The specificity of those methods may be limited due to potential cross-reactivity, especially with H. pylori-like microorganisms such as Campylobacter spp. Furthermore, the influence of gastroesophageal reflux has not been investigated so far.

The 'prototypical' Escherichia coli RNase R displays both exoribonuclease and helicase activities, but whether this latter RNA unwinding function is a general feature of bacterial RNase R had not been addressed. We observed that H. pylori HpRNase R protein does not carry the domains responsible for helicase activity and accordingly the purified protein is unable to degrade in vitro RNA molecules with secondary structures. The lack of RNase R helicase domains is widespread among the Campylobacterota, which include Helicobacter and Campylobacter genera, and this loss occurred gradually during their evolution. An in vivo interaction between HpRNase R and RhpA, the sole DEAD-box RNA helicase of H. pylori was discovered. Purified RhpA facilitates the degradation of double stranded RNA by HpRNase R, showing that this complex is functional. HpRNase R has a minor role in 5S rRNA maturation and few targets in H. pylori, all included in the RhpA regulon.

In turkeys, the ceca are an important anatomical site where Campylobacter asymptomatically colonizes. We previously demonstrated that commercial turkey poults colonized by C. jejuni showed acute changes in cytokine gene expression profiles, and histological intestinal lesions at 2 days post-inoculation (dpi). Cecal tonsils (CT) are an important part of the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue that surveil material passing in and out of the ceca, and generate immune responses against intestinal pathogens. The CT immune response toward Campylobacter remains unknown. In this study, we generated a kanamycin-resistant C. coli construct (CcK) to facilitate its enumeration from cecal contents after experimental challenge. In vitro analysis of CcK demonstrated no changes in motility when compared to the parent isolate. Poults were inoculated by oral gavage with CcK (5 x 10(7) colony forming units) or sterile-media (mock-colonized), and euthanized at 1 and 3 dpi. At both time points, CcK was recovered from cecal contents, but not from the mock-colonized group. As a marker of acute inflammation, serum alpha-1 acid glycoprotein was significantly elevated at 3 dpi in CcK inoculated poults compared to mock-infected samples. Significant histological lesions were detected in cecal and CT tissues of CcK colonized poults at 1 and 3 dpi, respectively. RNAseq analysis identified 250 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in CT from CcK colonized poults at 3 dpi, of which 194 were upregulated and 56 were downregulated. From the DEG, 9 significantly enriched biological pathways were identified, including platelet aggregation, response to oxidative stress and negative regulation of oxidative stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. These data suggest that C. coli induced an acute inflammatory response in the intestinal tract of poults, and that platelet aggregation and oxidative stress in the CT may affect the turkey's ability to resist Campylobacter colonization. These findings will help to develop and test Campylobacter mitigation strategies to promote food safety in commercial turkeys.",2297-1769 (Print) 2297-1769 (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fvets.2021.613203 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Campylobacter coli', 'Meleagris gallopavo (Turkey)', 'RNAseq analysis', 'acute phase protein', 'cecal tonsil']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Sylte, Sivasankaran, Trachsel, Sato, Wu, Johnson, Chandra,', 'Zhang and Looft.']",,

Why poultry has been shown to be one of the most significant sources of these bacteria, ruminants, especially cattle, are also responsible for a high number of human Campylobacter jejuni, and to a lesser extent Campylobacter coli, infections. In this study, bovine and pig carcasses in Poland were investigated for the presence of Campylobacter and for their antimicrobial resistance. A total of 204 swabs from bovine carcasses and 355 swab samples from pig carcasses were tested during 2014-2018. Campylobacter was identified in 129 (36.3%) of the pig and in 11 (5.4%) of the bovine carcasses, respectively. The pig isolates were classified as C. coli (121; 34.1%) or C. jejuni (8; 2.3%), whereas the bovine Campylobacter were identified either as C. jejuni (8; 3.9% isolates) or C. coli (3; 1.5% strains). Resistance of the isolates (n = 140) to erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and tetracycline revealed that the vast majority of C. coli was resistant to streptomycin (106 isolates; 85.5%), tetracycline (97; 78.2%), nalidixic acid (90; 72.6%), and ciprofloxacin (88; 71.0%). Among C. jejuni isolates (n = 16) the resistance rates to all antibiotics were lower than in C. coli, irrespective of the origin. A total of 74 of 121 (61.2%) C. coli isolates from the pig carcasses and one of three such isolates from the bovine samples were multiresistant. Most of the C. coli (64 isolates; 85.3%) had the ciprofloxacin+nalidixic acid+streptomycin+tetracycline resistance profile. The results suggest that pig and bovine carcasses may be an underestimated reservoir of Campylobacter, especially for C. coli in pigs. The high antimicrobial resistance rates of such strains to streptomycin, quinolones, and tetracyclines highlight the need for monitoring of these bacteria in such food and food products.",1556-7125 (Electronic) 1535-3141 (Linking),2021 Apr 21,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2295-8837'],['10.1089/fpd.2020.2914 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['Campylobacter', 'Poland', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'bovine and pig carcasses', 'monitoring', 'prevalence']",,,

In many infectious diseases, the immune response has an important role in limiting the invasion and proliferation of bacterial pathogens. Innate immune sensing of microorganisms is mediated by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and induces the secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines, like IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-8. In this study, the expression of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-8, and IFN-gamma in bovine endometrial epithelial cells infected with C. fetus and Salmonella Typhimurium (a bacterial invasion control) was analyzed. The results showed that expression levels of IL-1beta and IL-8 were high at the beginning of the infection and decreased throughout the intracellular period. Unlike in this same assay, the expression levels of IFN-gamma increased through time and reached the highest peak at 4 hours post infection. In cells infected with S. Typhimurium, the results showed that IL8 expression levels were highly induced by infection but not IFN-gamma. In cells infected with S. Typhimurium or C. fetus subsp. fetus, the results showed that TNF-alpha expression did not show any change during infection. A cytoskeleton inhibition assay was performed to determine if cytokine expression was modified by C. fetus subsp. fetus intracellular invasion.

In this study, we successfully generated EGFP marker-free transgenic (MF-TG) pigs with high expression levels of microbial beta-glucanase, xylanase, and phytase in the parotid gland. We collected intestinal contents from the ileum, cecum and colon of five MF-TG and five wild-type (WT) sows and investigated the gut microbiome of the transgenic pigs via metagenomic analysis.

Their importance as pathogens in international trade and reporting is also different yet the criteria defining these properties have never been fully substantiated nor understood. The situation is further compromised because the ability to differentiate between these two closely related C. fetus subspecies has traditionally been performed by phenotypic characterisation of isolates, methods which are limited in scope, time-consuming, tedious, and often yield inconsistent results, thereby leading to isolate misidentification. The development of robust genetic markers that could enable rapid discrimination between C. fetus subsp. fetus and subsp. venerealis has also been challenging due to limited differences in the gene complement of their genomes, high levels of sequence repetition, the small number of closed genome sequences available and the lack of standardisation of the discriminatory biochemical tests employed for comparative purposes. To yield a better understanding of the genomic differences that define these C. fetus strains, seven isolates were exhaustively characterised phenotypically and genetically and compared with seven previously well characterised isolates. Analysis of these 14 C. fetus samples clearly illustrated that adaption by C. fetus subsp. venerealis to the bovine reproductive tract correlated with increasing genome length and plasticity due to the acquisition and propagation of several mobile elements including prophages, transposons and plasmids harbouring virulence factors. Significant differences in the repertoire of the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats)-cas system of all C. fetus strains was also found. We therefore suggest that a deficiency in this adaptive immune system may have permitted the emergence of extensive genome plasticity and led to changes in host tropism through gene disruption and/or changes in gene expression. Notable differences in the sub-species complement of DNA adenine methylase genes may also have an impact.

Exposure to stress conditions encountered during the slaughtering process may induce bacterial adaptation mechanisms, and enhance or decrease pathogen resistance to subsequent stress. This adaptation may result from changes in bacterial gene expression. This study aims to accurately quantify the expression of selected C. jejuni genes after stresses inspired from the poultry slaughtering process. RT-qPCR was used to quantify gene expression of 44 genes in three strains after successive heat and cold stresses. Main results indicated that 26 genes out of 44 were differentially expressed following the successive thermal stresses. Three clusters of genes were differentially expressed according to the strain and the stress condition. Up-regulated genes mainly included genes involved in the heat shock response, whereas down-regulated genes belonged to metabolic pathways (such as lipid, amino-acid metabolisms). However, four genes were similarly overexpressed in the three strains; they might represent indicators of the thermal stress response at the species scale. Advances in the molecular understanding of the stress response of pathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter, in real-life processing conditions will make it possible to identify technological levers and better mitigate the microbial risk.",1095-9998 (Electronic) 0740-0020 (Linking),2021 Sep,,"['S0740-0020(21)00060-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fm.2021.103795 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['Cell history', 'Food safety', 'Foodborne pathogen', 'RT-qPCR', 'Strain variability']",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

A total of 28 cases of GBS with DFP, including the case in this report, were included in this study. The occurrence of DFP may be related to early subclinical demyelination of the facial nerve, the blood-nerve barrier of the facial nerve, facial movement, and descending reversible paralysis. The occurrence of unilateral facial palsy may be related to Campylobacter jejuni, specific anti-ganglioside antibodies, and the site of central nervous system anatomical involvement.

GastroPanel(R), serum biomarkers panel including pepsinogen I (PGI), pepsinogen II (PGII), Gastrin 17 (G17) and anti- H. pylori antibodies is a noninvasive test for adenocarcinoma risk assessment in chronic H. pylori gastritis patients. OBJECTIVE: Prospective study to evaluate the concordance between OLGA and OLGIM grading systems, as well as to evaluate GastroPanel s performance in patients with premalignant lesions secondary to H. pylori chronic gastritis in Brazil. METHODS: Patients with H. pylori chronic gastritis with premalignant lesions confirmed by histology were recruited from the gastrointestinal clinic of a University Hospital. All participants underwent endoscopic examination with biopsies which were reported according to updated Sydney system and premalignant lesions grading systems (OLGA and OLGIM). Blood samples were collected for biomarkers serological analysis (GastroPanel(R), Biohit, Helsinki, Finland). The cut off values used to define high risk patients were those recommended by the manufacturer: PGI </=30 microm/L and PGI/PGII </=3. RESULTS: 41 patients were recruited: 28 women, 13 men, mean age 67.3 (47-89, SD: 9.6) years. By OLGA system, were obtained: OLGA 0 (n=1), OLGA I (n=7), OLGA II (n=17), OLGA III (n=9), and OLGA IV (n=7). By OLGIM system, were obtained: OLGIM 0 (n=14), OLGIM I (n=5), OLGIM II (n=10), OLGIM III (n=10), and OLGIM IV (n=2). Regarding histological staging among patients staged as low risk (OLGA/OLGIM 0, I and II) and high risk (OLGA/OLGIM III and IV) for gastric cancer development, the concordance rate found between both classifications was 85.4%. Considering high risk patients, those patients thus included in at least one of the systems the final distribution of our sample considered 24 low-risk and 17 high-risk patients for the development of gastric cancer. To determine by GastroPanel(R) whether the patient would be at low or high risk of developing gastric cancer, PGI showed a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.47 (95%CI: 0.26-0.69), 0.67 (95%CI: 0.47-0.82), and 0.58 (95%CI: 0.43-0.72), respectively, while PGI/PGII showed sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.06 (95%CI: 0.01-0.27), 0.83 (95%CI: 0.64-0.93) and 0.51 (95%CI: 0.36-0.66), respectively. CONCLUSION: The histological classifications OLGA and OLGIM presented a substantial concordance rate among themselves.

It is a major, at times dominant, factor in the pathogenesis of a large spectrum of diseases such as acute and chronic gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, gastric carcinoma, and lymphoma. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that H. pylori chronic infection may be related to different extragastric diseases, including colorectal neoplasms. This concise review aims to explore the association of H. pylori infection with colorectal cancer and adenoma, including the recent epidemiological findings, the diagnostic methods employed to detect H. pylori and virulent factors, and the potentially involved mechanisms. Furthermore, is attempted to establish the current data integration for causal inference using the Bradford-Hill causality criteria. The weak, although global, strength of the epidemiological positive association between H. pylori infection and colonic neoplasms associated to new mechanisms postulated to explain this interaction, including intestinal dysbiosis, should stimulate future studies.

We aimed to examine its prevalence, clinical features, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings based on 50 patients encountered in one facility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were all patients who had undergone gastric mucosal biopsy endoscopically at Kenwakai Hospital for approximately 10 years. NHPH infection was diagnosed by microscopic findings of Giemsa staining performed on all specimens. PCR analysis of urease genes was performed to detect and identify NHPH, when informed consent was obtained. Helicobacter pylori-diagnostic tests were also performed. NHPH-infected patients were questioned about symptoms and animal contact. RESULTS: NHPH gastritis was found in 50 of 3847 patients (1.30%). The percentage increased to 3.35% (30 of 896 patients) in the latter 2 years and 4 months with increasing recognition of its characteristic endoscopic findings by endoscopists. PCR analysis, performed in 30 patients, detected NHPH in 28 patients: 26 as Helicobacter suis and 2 as Helicobacter heilmanii/Helicobacter ailurogastricus. Helicobacter pylori-diagnostic tests were almost negative. However, anti-H. pylori antibody showed high-negative titer (3.0-9.9 U/ml) in 12. Of 50 patients (consisting of 49 men and 1 woman), almost all were asymptomatic, and 25 were keeping pets. Regarding EGD findings, in all 50 patients, ""crack-like mucosa"" and/or nodular gastritis was noted in gastric antrum, and regular arrangement of collecting venules (RAC) was noted in gastric corpus. None of the patients infected with NHPH were co-infected with H. pylori. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence was finally estimated to be approximately 3.35%. Helicobacter suis was the most common NHPH species.

Growth retardation (GR) generally accompanies CD due to gastrointestinal complications and should be treated as early as possible along with initiation of a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to determine the indicators of GR in patients with CD. METHODS: This single-centre retrospective study included paediatric outpatients with CD. All patients were diagnosed with CD via serological analysis and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy if necessary. Patient records were obtained from Adana City Training and Research Hospital. Patients that were diagnosed with GR accompanying CD were given oral nutritional supplements and followed-up every 3-6 months. Statistical relationships between demographics, and anthropometric measurements, duration of breastfeeding, gluten contact time, diet duration, presenting complaints and serological findings were evaluated. RESULTS: This study included 169 paediatric outpatients between ages 1 and 18. Longer symptom duration and shorter breastfeeding duration were significantly correlated with GR accompanying CD (P = 0.007 and P = 0.029, respectively). Vomiting was the only symptom that was correlated with the presence of GR (P = 0.010). Helicobacter pylori infection was not correlated with the presence of GR (P = 0.277).

In recent years, due to increased life pressure, unhealthy eating habits and environment, the incidence of gastric ulcer has increased year by year. Because the disease has a long treatment cycle and is prone to relapse, if it cannot be controlled in time, it can cause the disease to prolong, affect the daily life and health of the patient, and even cause complications such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcer perforation, and pyloric obstruction. Helicobacter pylori infection is one of the main causes of GU. Clinically, the curative effect of western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine cannot reach the ideal level, so in recent years, the combination of traditional Chinese and western medicine has been highly praised. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Chinese medicine combined with omeprazole for GU.

Although the expansion of insurance coverage has led to an increase in the number of patients treated for H. pylori, the population impact of eradication treatment for H.pylori has been scarcely investigated. This study aimed to clarify the long-term responses of H. pylori antibody titer after eradication treatment using large scale cross-sectional data from the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study for the Next Generation (JPHC-NEXT Study). METHODS: A total of 55,282 Japanese participants aged 40 to 74 years residing in 16 areas provided blood samples between 2011 and 2016. From these, treated (n=6,276) and untreated subjects who were seropositive for H. pylori or had serological atrophy (n= 22,420) formed the study population (n=28,696). Seropositivity was defined as an anti-H. pylori IgG titer of >/=10 U/mL. Antibody level was compared among subjects according to self-reported treatment history as untreated, and treated for less than one year (<1Y), one to five years (1-5Y), and more than six years ago (6Y+). RESULTS: Median serum antibody titer was 34.0 U/mL, 7.9 U/mL, 4.0 U/mL, and 2.9 U/mL for the Untreated, <1Y, 1-5Y, and 6Y+ groups, respectively. While those treated for H.pylori within the previous year had a 76.8% lower antibody titer compared to untreated subjects, approximately 41% of subjects were still seropositive.

METHODS: We conducted this study from 2016 to 2017 in an urban and a rural community in Wuwei City. Stool antigen tests targeted individuals aged 0 to 3 years old, and (13) C-urea breath tests targeted individuals aged above 3 years. We selected participants based on hierarchical cluster sampling. We assessed the association between variables and H. pylori infection based on logistic regression models. RESULTS: Ultimately, the results of 2,163 participants (age: 0 to 77 years old) were included (1,238 minors and 925 adults) in the analysis. The overall prevalence of H. pylori infection was 35.6%. It increased with age, reaching the peak in the 30 to 39 age group, and then began to decline. In multivariate analysis, age was positively associated with prevalence of H. pylori infection, and factors negatively associated with the prevalence were drinking running water, the frequency of yoghurt consumption, and an annual household income of Renminbi ( yen) 30,000-100,000 or 100,000 above. In the subgroup analyses, however, the same variables associated differently in different age groups. Additionally, we interestingly noticed that boarding, eating at school cafeterias over six times per week, and frequently drinking untreated water were independent predictors of H. pylori infection in junior and senior high school students. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of H. pylori infection is moderate and closely associated with the socioeconomic conditions of Wuwei City, as well as the sanitary situations and dietary habits of the participants in the city.

The ability of H. pylori to cause different clinical outcomes is thought to be associated with unique sets of its genetic features. However, only few genetic features have been definitively linked to specific gastrointestinal pathologies. Genome heterogeneity of clinical H. pylori strains from patients with four different gastric disorders was studied to explore the population structure and molecular genomic features and their association with pathogenicity. Population analysis showed that 92.9% of the Shanghai H. pylori isolates were clustered in the East Asia group. Among 2,866 genes detected in all genomes, 1,146 genes formed the core genome, whereas 209 unique genes were detected in individual disease groups. The unique genes of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer groups represented the inorganic ion transport and metabolism function gene clusters. Sixteen virulence genes were detected with statistically different detection rates among the four disease groups. Furthermore, 127 clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats were found with significantly different rates in the four disease groups. A total of 337 putative genomic islands were identified, and three genomic islands were individually found in more than 10% of strains.

HPV-positive OPSCCs behave differently from HPV-negative tumors and often present with early lymph node involvement. The bacterial microbiome of HPV-associated OPSCC may contribute to carcinogenesis, and certain bacteria may influence the spread of cancer from the primary site to regional lymphatics. OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial microbiome in patients with HPV-associated, early tonsil SCC and compare them to benign tonsil specimens. METHOD: The microbiome of primary tumor specimens and lymph nodes was compared to benign tonsillectomy specimens with pan-pathogen microarray (PathoChip). RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were enrolled in the study. Patients with OPSCC had a microbiome that shifted towards more gram-negative. Numerous signatures of bacterial family and species were associated with the primary tumors and lymph nodes of cancer patients, including the urogenital pathogens Proteus mirabilis and Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Shigella dysenteriae, and Orientia tsutsugamushi. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that detection of urogenital pathogens is associated with lymph node metastasis for patients with HPV-positive OPSCCs.

Provision of HIV self-testing and STI self-collection can increase testing rates, and access to these kits through mobile applications (apps) could help facilitate YMSM using HIV self-testing and STI self-collection. Methods: Data for this study comes from two pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mobile apps within the Adolescent Trials Network-LYNX and MyChoices-aimed to increase HIV/STI testing among YMSM (age 15-24) who had not recently tested for HIV and were at high risk for HIV acquisition across five US cities. Both apps include the ability to order a HIV self-test with rapid results and a kit for STI self-collection and mailing of samples for syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia to a lab for testing. Using assessments of app users (n=80) at pre-randomization and at 3- and 6-months post-randomization and online interview data from a purposive sample of app users (n=37), we report on experiences and lessons learned with HIV self-testing and STI self-collection kits ordered via the apps. Results: Participants were on average 20.7 years of age (SD =2.4), and 49% were non-White or multiple race/ethnicity. Sixty-three percent had a prior HIV test. Over half (58%) had a prior STI test, but only 3% had tested within the past 3 months. Nearly two-thirds ordered an HIV self-testing kit; of whom, 75% reported using at least one self-test kit over the study period. STI self-collection kit ordering rates were also high (54%); however, STI self-collection kit return rates were lower (13%), but with a high positivity rate (5.3%). Both HIV self-testing and STI self-collection kits were highly acceptable, and 87% reported that it was extremely/very helpful to be able to order these kits through the apps. The most common reason for not ordering the HIV/STI kits was preferring to test at a clinic. In interviews, participants expressed feeling empowered by being able to test at home; however, they also raised concerns around STI sample collection. Conclusions: HIV self-testing and STI self-collection kit ordering via mobile apps is feasible, acceptable and may show promise in increasing testing rates among YMSM. The LYNX and MyChoices apps are currently being tested in a full-scale efficacy trial, and if successful, these innovative mobile apps could be scaled up to efficiently increase HIV/STI testing among youth across the US.",2306-9740 (Print) 2306-9740 (Linking),2021,,"['10.21037/mhealth-20-70 [doi]', 'mh-07-20-70 [pii]']",['eng'],China,"['HIV', 'Self-testing', 'mobile apps', 'sexually transmitted infections (STIs)', 'young men who have sex with men (YMSM)']",['2021 mHealth.

This study aimed to evaluate CT infection and its effects on seminal parameters and cytokines in asymptomatic patients with teratozoospermia. Material and methods: Semen samples from one hundred four male patients were collected, and CT detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The quality (volume, sperm concentration, pH, motility, morphology, and leucocytes) of the semen was measured by standard procedures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)], as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10), were determined by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The frequency of CT infection was expressed as a percentage. Descriptive statistics were used for comparison of cytokines from infertile men, and then the Mann-Whitney U test was applied for the contrast of seminal parameters and cytokines from CT-infected versus non-CT infected men. Results: A ratio of 33/104 (31.7%) patients were positive for CT infection. The ejaculate of positive CT infection was found to have increased pH (pH = 7.65 in non-CT infected vs. 7.94 CT-infected men; p = 0.026). High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in the population studied; however, infected males were noted to have high levels of IL-1 beta [184.66 (0-3985.33 pg/ml), p = 0.001] and IL-6 [87.8 (0-1042.8 pg/ml), p = 0.001].

L2B variant has been reported as the predominant strain in the current LGV epidemics, although a shift towards L2-434 has been observed in some European countries. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and characterize the population with LGV infection diagnosed in Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Lisboa Central, Lisbon, Portugal. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all LGV diagnoses between 2016 and 2019 was performed. The diagnosis was established through ompA-genotyping of samples yielding a positive result to Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). All considered samples were retrieved from the clinician activity, through swabbing and urine analysis and CT infection diagnosis was obtained using real-time PCR. RESULTS: During the period studied 16279 CT diagnostics tests were employed, with a striking increase from 2016 (n=467) to 2019 (n=9362). 1602 diagnoses of CT were established, from which 168 (10.5%) corresponded to LGV, with both infections showing a rising evolution, between 2016 and 2019, of 2.9 and 2.7 times, respectively. The majority of the LGV strains were genotyped as L2/434 (67.3%; n= 113). LGV predominantly affected MSM and men who have sex with men and women (97.0%; n=163). Anorectal infection was the most prevalent one (90.5%; n=152), being proctitis the main clinical presentation (76.2%; n=128). Absence of symptoms was reported in almost 15% of the cases (n=24). The presence of concomitant infection with human immunodeficiency virus was dominant (73.2%; n=123) and the prevalence of one or more STI co-infections was about 60.1% (n=99). CONCLUSIONS: An increasing evolution of CT and LGV testing and diagnosing was observable throughout the studied period. Characteristics of the population are similar with those described within LGV epidemics.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the real-world effectiveness of establishing a prenatal expedited partner therapy program in eradicating chlamydia before delivery. To examine the maternal and neonatal outcomes among women treated for chlamydia in pregnancy compared among those that received expedited partner therapy to those that underwent standard partner-referral testing and treatment. STUDY DESIGN: An expedited partner therapy program was implemented on August 21, 2019 at a public hospital in a county with high chlamydia prevalence. Pregnant women were provided with single-dose packets of azithromycin to treat partner(s) following diagnosis of chlamydia. We prospectively studied pregnant women treated in the expedited partner therapy program who delivered at our institution in the same year and compared outcomes to a historical cohort from the year prior that had traditional partner-referral for testing and treatment. We excluded women with concurrent gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, or current intimate partner violence. The primary outcome was chlamydia reinfection or no-cure at repeat testing 4-6 weeks following treatment or at the 36-week prenatal care screening. Secondary outcomes included obstetric, maternal, and neonatal outcomes including prelabor rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, neonatal intensive care unit admission, neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, and conjunctivitis. RESULTS: The rate of chlamydia was 3.6% over a 2-year period in our delivered population. In the year following implementation of expedited partner therapy, 471 women (mean [SD] age, 23.8 [5.3] years) were diagnosed with chlamydia delivered at our institution, compared with 419 women (mean [SD] age, 23.4 [5.5] years) the previous year. There were no differences in race, parity, prenatal care attendance, or concomitant sexually transmitted infections.

However, the exact mechanism of anti-oxidative stress of C. trachomatis is still unclear. The activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/quinone oxidoreductase (Nrf2/NQO1) signal pathway has been identified as an efficient antioxidant defensive mechanism used by host cells to counteract oxidative stress. Pgp3 is a pivotal virulence factor of C. trachomatis involved in intracellular survival. The aim of this study is to explore the role of Pgp3 on Nrf2/NQO1 signal pathway against oxidative stress. MAIN METHODS: After HeLa cells were stimulated with Pgp3 protein, Nrf2 location and the inclusion bodies of C. trachomatis were detected by indirect immunofluorescence, western blotting and Oxidative stress assay kits were used to separately determine the protein expression and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) before and after the interference of Nrf-2 and NQO1. KEY FINDINGS: Pgp3 promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 to increase NQO1 expression and reduced oxidative stress induced by LPS to contribute to the survival of C. trachomatis. Inhibition of Nrf2/NQO1 signal pathway with Nrf2 inhibitor and down-regulation of NQO1 with siRNA-NQO1 suppressed oxidative stress resistance induced by Pgp3. SIGNIFICANCE: Here we found that Pgp3 alleviated oxidative stress to promote the infectivity of C. trachomatis through activation of Nrf2/NQO1 signal pathway, which provided a novel understanding of the effects of Pgp3 in the pathogenesis of C. trachomatis.",1879-0631 (Electronic) 0024-3205 (Linking),2021 Apr 20,,"['S0024-3205(21)00487-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2021.119502 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Nrf2/NQO1 signal pathway', 'Oxidative stress', 'Pgp3 protein']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of STIs; Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Treponema pallidum (syphilis), Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) among pregnant women visiting an antenatal care center in Nepal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adapted and piloted the WHO standard protocol for conducting a prevalence survey of STIs among pregnant women visiting antenatal care center of Dhulikhel Hospital, Nepal. Patient recruitment, data collection, and specimen testing took place between November 2019-March 2020. First catch urine sample was collected from each eligible woman. GeneXpert platform was used for CT and NG testing. Wet-mount microscopy of urine sample was used for detection of trichomoniasis. Serological test for HIV was done by rapid and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. Serological test for syphilis was done using ""nonspecific non-treponemal"" and ""specific treponemal"" antibody tests. Tests for CT, NG and trichomoniasis were done as part of the prevalence study while tests for syphilis and HIV were done as part of the routine antenatal testing. RESULTS: 672 women were approached to participate in the study, out of which 591 (87.9%) met the eligibility criteria and consented to participate. The overall prevalence of any STIs was 8.6% (51/591, 95% CI: 6.3-10.8); 1.5% (95% CI: 0.5-2.5) for CT and 7.1% (95% CI: 5.0-9.2) for trichomoniasis infection. None of the samples tested positive for NG, HIV or syphilis. Prevalence of any STI was not significantly different among women, age </= 24 years (10%, 25/229) compared to women age >/=25 years (7.1%, 26/362) (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of trichomoniasis among pregnant women in this sub-urban population of Nepal was high compared to few cases of CT and no cases of NG, syphilis, and HIV.

Hepatitis C virus testing rates vary by race/ethnicity in the general population, but limited data are available for PWH. Methods: We analyzed medical records data from MSM in the HIV Outpatient Study at 9 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinics from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019. We excluded observation time after documented past or current HCV infection. We evaluated HCV antibody testing in each calendar year among HCV-seronegative MSM, and we assessed testing correlates by generalized estimating equation analyses. Results: Of 1829 eligible MSM who were PWH, 1174 (64.2%) were non-Hispanic/Latino white (NHW), 402 (22.0%) non-Hispanic black (NHB), 187 (10.2%) Hispanic/Latino, and 66 (3.6%) of other race/ethnicity.

Serum samples were collected and probed with a protein microarray expressing 864/894 (96.4%) of the open reading frames of the C. trachomatis serovar D genome. The antibody response to the primary infection was analyzed in 72 serum samples from 12 inoculated monkeys. The following criteria were utilized to identify immunodominant antigens: proteins found to be recognized by at least 75% (9/12) of the infected monkeys with at least 15% elevations in signal intensity from week 0 to week 8 post infection. All infected monkeys developed Chlamydia specific serum antibodies. Eight proteins satisfied the selection criteria for immunodominant antigens: CT242 (OmpH-like protein), CT541 (mip), CT681 (ompA), CT381 (artJ), CT443 (omcB), CT119 (incA), CT486 (fliY), and CT110 (groEL). Of these, three antigens, CT119, CT486 and CT381, were not previously identified as immunodominant antigens using non-human primate sera.

The most common causes are opportunistic microorganisms and responsible for sexually transmitted infections associated with unprotected sex. The objective is to determine the microorganisms that cause these infections in patients treated at the Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves in Granada and Neisseria gonorrhoeae susceptibility to antibiotics. METHODS: A transversal-descriptive and retrospective study was carried out, which included the results issued, between January 2018 and December 2019, in the Microbiology Laboratory from all the episodes studied using standardized working procedures. RESULTS: The most frequently detected microorganisms were Gardnerella vaginalis (23.81%) followed by Candida spp. (20.9%), especially in females, and N. gonorrhoeae (11.36%) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (11.99%), in males. Many times, they were presented in combination. Regarding herpes simplex viruses, infection by both species had a similar prevalence (50%) in males, while type 1 was more prevalent (76.52%) in females. The most active antibiotics against N. gonorrhoeae were cefotaxime (98%) and cefixime (100%). Tetracycline (39.02%) a poorly active antibiotic. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens corresponded to those that usually caused infections in females, although N. gonorrhoeae was the most frequent in males and mixed infections are not an accidental finding.

Early detection and timely standard treatment are the key to current prevention and control of drug-resistant TB. In recent years, despite the continuous advancement in drug-resistant TB diagnostic technology, the needs for clinical rapid and accurate diagnosis are still not fully met. With the development of sequencing technology, the research of human microecology has been intensified. This study aims to use 16 rRNA sequencing technology to detect and analyze upper respiratory flora of TB patients with anti-TB drug sensitivity (DS, n = 55), monoresistance isoniazide (MR-INH, n = 33), monoresistance rifampin (MR-RFP, n = 12), multidrug resistance (MDR, n = 26) and polyresistance (PR, n = 39) in southern China. Potential microbial diagnostic markers for different types of TB drug resistance are searched by screening differential flora, which provides certain guiding significance for drug resistance diagnosis and clinical drug use of TB. The results showed that the pulmonary microenvironment of TB patients was more susceptible to infection by external pathogens, and the infection of different drug-resistant Mtb leads to changes in different flora. Importantly, seven novel microorganisms (Leptotrichia, Granulicatella, Campylobacter, Delfitia, Kingella, Chlamydophila, Bordetella) were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as diagnostic markers for different drug resistance types of TB. Leptotrichia, Granulicatella, Campylobacter were potential diagnostic marker for TB patients with INH single-resistance. Delftia was a potential diagnostic marker for TB patients with RFP single drug-resistance. Kingella and Chlamydophila can be used as diagnostic markers for TB patients with PR.

On average, 11 psittacosis cases per year were reported in the United States during 2000-2017. During August-October 2018, the largest U.S. psittacosis outbreak in 30 years (82 cases identified*) occurred in two poultry slaughter plants, one each in Virginia and Georgia, that shared source farms (2). CDC used C. psittaci real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test 54 human specimens from this outbreak. This was the largest number of human specimens from a single outbreak ever tested for C. psittaci using real-time PCR, which is faster and more sensitive than commercially available serologic tests. This represented a rare opportunity to assess the utility of multiple specimen types for real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci. C. psittaci was detected more frequently in lower respiratory specimens (59% [10 of 17]) and stool (four of five) than in upper respiratory specimens (7% [two of 28]). Among six patients with sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs tested, C. psittaci was detected only in sputum in five patients. Cycle threshold (Ct) values suggested bacterial load was higher in lower respiratory specimens than in nasopharyngeal swabs. These findings support prioritizing lower respiratory specimens for real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci.

The latter may vary in different geographic areas according to prescription profiles and vaccination programs. Beta-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides are the most commonly used antimicrobials during the exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and community-acquired pneumonia. In their prescription, different aspects such as intrinsic activity, bactericidal effect or their ability to prevent the development of resistance must be taken into account. The latter is related to the PK/PD parameters, the mutant prevention concentration and the so-called selection window. More recently, the potential ecological impact has grown in importance, not only on the intestinal microbiota, but also on the respiratory one. Maintaining the state of eubiosis requires the use of antimicrobials with a low profile of action on anaerobic bacteria. With their use, the resilience of the bacterial populations belonging to the microbiota, the state of resistance of colonization and the collateral damage related to the emergence of resistance to the antimicrobials in pathogens causing the infections and in the bacterial populations integrating the microbiota.",1988-9518 (Electronic) 0214-3429 (Linking),2021 Apr,,['10.37201/req/049.2021 [doi]'],['spa'],Spain,"['antimicrobial treatment', 'community acquired respiratory infection', 'microbiology', 'microbiome', 'pathogen']","['(c)The Author 2021.

Although the precise mechanisms that link glycemia to the exacerbated infections remain elusive, hyperglycemia is known to induce a wide array of changes in the immune system activity, including alterations in: (i) the microenvironment of immune cells (e.g., pH, blood viscosity and other biochemical parameters); (ii) the supply of energy to infectious bacteria; (iii) the inflammatory response; and (iv) oxidative stress as a result of bacterial proliferative metabolism. Consistent with this evidence, some bacterial infections are typical (and/or have a worse prognosis) in patients with hypercaloric diets and a stressful lifestyle (conditions that promote hyperglycemic episodes). On this basis, the present review is particularly focused on: (i) the role of diabetes in the development of some bacterial and viral infections by analyzing preclinical and clinical findings; (ii) discussing the possible mechanisms by which hyperglycemia may increase the susceptibility for developing infections; and (iii) further understanding the impact of hyperglycemia on the immune system.",2296-2565 (Electronic) 2296-2565 (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fpubh.2021.559595 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['*COVID-19', '*diabetes', '*hyperglycemia', '*immune system', '*infections']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Chavez-Reyes, Escarcega-Gonzalez, Chavira-Suarez,', 'Leon-Buitimea, Vazquez-Leon, Morones-Ramirez, Villalon, Quintanar-Stephano and', 'Marichal-Cancino.']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology', 'COVID-19/*etiology', 'Diabetes Complications/*immunology/*physiopathology', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperglycemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Virus Diseases/*etiology']"

Disease probabilities were categorized into 3 grades (high: >/=50%, intermediate: 20% >/= and <50%, and low: <20%) and were judged by physicians who were taking care of the patients. Confirmation of atypical pathogens was performed by comprehensive molecular analyses of respiratory samples. Results: Atypical pathogens were detected in 21 of 210 patients. A close contact history (odds ratio [OR]: 11.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-53.5) and the presence of pneumonia (OR: 12.9, CI: 4.3-39.2) were associated with the detections. Atypical pathogens were detected in 32.3% of high-probability cases (10/31), while atypical pathogens were only detected in 8.8% of intermediate-probability cases (8/91) and 3.4% of low-probability cases (3/88) (P < .001). Conclusions: The current study indicates that physicians' predictions were associated with the detection of atypical pathogens; however, overestimation was observed.",2189-7948 (Electronic) 2189-7948 (Linking),2020 Nov,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8137-3340', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3034-7588', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9789-8301', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9325-7934']","['10.1002/jgf2.350 [doi]', 'JGF2350 [pii]']",['eng'],Japan,"['Atypical pathogen', 'Bordetella pertussis', 'Chlamydophila pneumoniae', 'Infectious diseases', 'Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'the Japanese Respiratory Society guideline']","['(c) 2020 The Authors.

This study was conducted to identify nonspecific and atypical pathogens associated with acute exacerbations of COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2013 and February 2015, 107 patients were analyzed. Sixty-nine comprised the inpatient and 38 comprised the outpatient treatment group. RESULTS: When nonspecific culture results were taken into consideration only a causative organism could be detected in 46.7% of the patients. The detection rate increased to 85.1% with the additional use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, and culture methods. More than one causative agent was responsible for COPD exacerbation in 53.3% of patients: two agents in 37.3%, three agents in 15%, and four agents in 0.9%. H. influenzae was detected in 63 (58.9%) patients, S. pneumoniae in 57 (53.2%), P. aeruginosa in 15 (14.0%), and L. pneumophila in 11 (10%). L. pneumophila was the more commonly isolated agent in the inpatient group (P = 0.002). Patients receiving continuous oxygen therapy and noninvasive mechanical ventilation were more likely to have an exacerbation associated with P. aeruginosa (P = 0.008 and P = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSION: The additional use of DFA for Legionella and multiplex PCR in combination with nonspecific microbiological culturing methods greatly improves the ability to identify infectious agents in acute exacerbations of COPD. There should be a high index of suspicion for P.aeruginosa as a causative organism, particularly in subjects receiving continuous oxygen therapy and/or using NIV and L. pneumophila should certainly be taken into consideration in severe COPD exacerbations.",1752-699X (Electronic) 1752-6981 (Linking),2021 Feb,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6508-0871', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4289-1975', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6650-1495', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7067-9360', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8735-5725', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3007-3422', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6915-9843', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6998-5421', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7678-3393']",['10.1111/crj.13286 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Legionella pneumophila', 'acute exacerbations of COPD', 'atypical bacteria', 'nonspecific pathogens']",['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 3 cases of C. psittaci pneumonia admitted to People's Hospital of Tongling City from July 2019 to January 2020. The patients' contact history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination, imaging characteristics and evolution, etiology, treatment process and outcome were analyzed, so as to provide experience for the diagnosis and prevention of C. psittaci pneumonia. RESULTS: The 3 patients had been infected through pet or zoonotic exposures. All symptoms included high fever (body temperature > 39 centigrade), cough, sputum, chest tightness and dyspnea. The disease progressed rapidly, with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock as the main manifestations, but the damages to the heart, liver and kidney were mild. Laboratory tests showed that C-reactive protein (CRP, all > 200 mg/L) and neutrophil proportion (Neut%, > 0.90) were significantly increased, while white blood cell count (WBC) and procalcitonin (PCT) were not significantly increased. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed inflammatory infiltration with interstitial changes, either unilateral or bilateral. Chest X-ray showed large areas of inflammatory infiltrations, fan-shaped or wedge-shaped to the edge of pleura. After 7 days of treatment, the bedside computed X-ray (CR) showed absorption of infiltration. After 11-13 days, the CT reexamination indicated lung infection was basically absorbed. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) confirmed the presence of C. psittaci in patients' sputum. It was sensitive to quinolones and tetracyclines. The patients' body temperature dropped to normal after 2-3 days of antibiotics, and all patients were extubated and transferred to normal ward 10 days later.

Chlamydia psittaci is primarily a pathogen of birds but can also cause disease in other species. Equine reproductive loss caused by C. psittaci has recently been identified in Australia where cases of human disease were also reported in individuals exposed to foetal membranes from an ill neonatal foal in New South Wales.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. The prevalence of C. psittaci in association with equine reproductive over time and in different regions of Australia is not known.Aim. This study was conducted to detect C. psittaci in equine abortion cases in Australia using archived samples spanning 25 years.Methodology. We tested for C. psittaci in 600 equine abortion cases reported in Australia between 1994 to 2019 using a Chlamydiaceae real-time quantitative PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene followed by high-resolution melt curve analysis. Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis was performed on positive samples.Results. The overall prevalence of C. psittaci in material from equine abortion cases was 6.5 %. C. psittaci-positive cases were detected in most years that were represented in this study and occurred in Victoria (prevalence of 7.6 %), New South Wales (prevalence of 3.9 %) and South Australia (prevalence of 15.4 %). Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis showed that the C. psittaci detected in the equine abortion cases clustered with the parrot-associated 6BC clade (genotype A/ST24), indicating that infection of horses may be due to spillover from native Australian parrots.Conclusion. This work suggests that C. psittaci has been a signi fi cant agent of equine abortion in Australia for several decades and underscores the importance of taking appropriate protective measures to avoid infection when handling equine aborted material.",1473-5644 (Electronic) 0022-2615 (Linking),2021 Feb,,['10.1099/jmm.0.001284 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Australia', 'Chlamydia psittaci', 'abortion', 'equine', 'horse', 'zoonosis']",,"['0 (Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)', '149024-69-1 (OMPA outer membrane proteins)']","['Abortion, Septic/*microbiology', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Bird Diseases/microbiology/*transmission', 'Chlamydophila psittaci/*classification/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Horse Diseases/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Horses', 'Infection Control', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Parrots/microbiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Pregnancy', 'Psittacosis/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']"

Parrots are a major host, yet prevalence and risk factors for infection in wild parrots are largely unknown. Additionally, recent research suggests there is a diverse range of novel Chlamydiales circulating in wildlife. We therefore sampled seven abundant parrot species in south-eastern Australia, taking cloacal swabs and serum from n = 132 wild adults. We determined C. psittaci and Chlamydiales prevalence and seroprevalence, and tested for host species, sex, geographical and seasonal differences, and temporal changes in individual infection status. Across all species, Chlamydiales prevalence was 39.8% (95% CI 31.6, 48.7), C. psittaci prevalence was 9.8% (95% CI 5.7, 16.3) and C. gallinacea prevalence was 0.8% (95% CI 0.1, 4.5). Other Chlamydiales species were not identified to species level. We identified two C. psittaci strains within the 6BC clade, which is highly virulent in humans. Seroprevalence was 37.0% (95% CI 28.5, 46.4). Host species (including crimson rosellas, galahs, sulphur-crested cockatoos and blue-winged parrots) differed in seroprevalence and Chlamydiales prevalence. Galahs had both highest Chlamydiales prevalence (54.8%) and seroprevalence (74.1%). Seroprevalence differed between sites, with a larger difference in males (range 20-63%) than females (29-44%).

The detection of C. psittaci DNA in the lung and equine foetal membranes of the aborted or weak foals and the absence of any other factors that are commonly associated with abortion or neonatal death suggest that this pathogen may be the cause of the reproductive loss. The detection of C. psittaci in these cases is consistent with the recent detection of C. psittaci in association with equine abortion in New South Wales.

In vivo, the host immune system will release gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) to combat infection. IFN-gamma activates human cells to produce the tryptophan (Trp)-catabolizing enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Consequently, there is a reduction in cytosolic Trp in IFN-gamma-activated host cells. In evolving to obligate intracellular dependence, Chlamydia has significantly reduced its genome size and content, as it relies on the host cell for various nutrients. Importantly, C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae are Trp auxotrophs and are starved for this essential nutrient when the human host cell is exposed to IFN-gamma. To survive this, chlamydiae enter an alternative developmental state referred to as persistence. Chlamydial persistence is characterized by a halt in the division cycle, aberrant morphology, and, in the case of IFN-gamma-induced persistence, Trp codon-dependent changes in transcription. We hypothesize that these changes in transcription are dependent on the particular amino acid starvation state. To investigate the chlamydial response mechanisms acting when other amino acids become limiting, we tested the efficacy of prokaryote-specific tRNA synthetase inhibitors, indolmycin and AN3365, to mimic starvation of Trp and leucine, respectively. We show that these drugs block chlamydial growth and induce changes in morphology and transcription consistent with persistence. Importantly, growth inhibition was reversed when the compounds were removed from the medium. With these data, we find that indolmycin and AN3365 are valid tools that can be used to mimic the persistent state independently of IFN-gamma.",1098-5522 (Electronic) 0019-9567 (Linking),2020 Mar 23,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3721-6839'],"['IAI.00943-19 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.00943-19 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['*Chlamydia', '*IFN-gamma', '*amino acid limitation', '*amino acid starvation', '*codon-dependent transcription', '*leucine', '*persistence', '*tRNA synthetase inhibitors', '*tRNA synthetases', '*tryptophan']",['Copyright (c) 2020 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'EC 6.1.1.- (Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'ZMC93U2C8P (indolmycin)']","['*Adaptation, Physiological', 'Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Chlamydia Infections/*microbiology', 'Chlamydia trachomatis/cytology/drug effects/enzymology/*growth & development', 'Chlamydophila pneumoniae/cytology/drug effects/enzymology/*growth & development', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Indoles/metabolism', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tryptophan/*metabolism']"

We found that a few of the synthesized 4-substituted phenazines could block the infectivity of chlamydiae without host cell toxicity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to design and synthesize two series of novel 3-substituted phenazines to find novel antichlamydial agents. METHODS: The 3-substituted phenazines were synthesized via Buchwald-Hartwig cross coupling reaction and Suzuki reaction from 3-bromo-1-methoxyphenazine. The antichlamydial activity of these synthesized compounds was evaluated by determining their effect on the yield of infectious progeny EBs. Cytotoxicity of these compounds on host cells was assessed by the treatment of uninfected HeLa cells using WST-1 method. RESULTS: Most of the 3-substituted phenazines possessed potent antichlamydial activity with IC50 values from 0.15 to 12.08 muM against Chlamydia trachomatis L2, C. muridarum MoPn and C. pneumoniae AR39. Among them, 7d and 9a exhibited better antichlamydial activity with IC50 values from 0.20 to 1.01 muM while they have no apparent cytotoxicity to host cells. Biological assay disclosed that both 7d and 9a inhibited chlamydial infection by reducing elementary body infectivity and disturbing chlamydial growth during the whole chlamydial developmental cycle.

Mouse models are generally used for vaccine development, to study the immune response and histopathology associated with Chlamydia infection. An important question regarding murine models is the in vivo identification of murine host genes responsible for the elimination of the murine and human Chlamydia strains. RNA sequencing of the Chlamydia muridarum infected BALB/c lung transcriptome revealed that several genes with direct antichlamydial functions were induced at the tissue level, including the already described and novel members of the murine interferon-inducible GTPase family, the CXCL chemokines CXCL9, CXCL11, immunoresponsive gene 1, nitric oxide synthase-2 (iNOS), and lipocalin-2. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1-2 (IDO1-2) previously described potent antichlamydial host enzymes were also highly expressed in the infected murine lungs. This finding was novel, since IDO was considered as a unique human antichlamydial defense gene. Besides a lower level of epithelial cell positivity, immunohistochemistry showed that IDO1-2 proteins were expressed prominently in macrophages. Detection of the tryptophan degradation product kynurenine and the impact of IDO inhibition on Chlamydia muridarum growth proved that the IDO1-2 proteins were functionally active. IDO1-2 activity also increased in Chlamydia muridarum infected C57BL/6 lung tissues, indicating that this phenomenon is not mouse strain specific. Our study shows that the murine antichlamydial response includes a variety of highly up-regulated defense genes in vivo. Among these genes the antichlamydial effectors IDO1-2 were identified.

Biofilm structures often contain multiple organisms in a symbiotic relationship, with the goal of providing shelter from environmental stressors such as antimicrobial agents. Because multiple co-infections are common in Lyme disease, the main questions of this study were whether BL tissues contained other pathogenic species and/or whether there is any co-existence with Borrelia biofilms. Recent reports suggested Chlamydia-like organisms in ticks and Borrelia-infected human skin tissues; therefore, Chlamydia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses were performed in Borrelia-positive BL tissues. Analyses of the sequence of the positive PCR bands revealed that Chlamydia spp. DNAs are indeed present in these tissues, and their sequences have the best identity match to Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Fluorescent immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methods demonstrated the presence of Chlamydia antigen and DNA in 84% of Borrelia biofilms.

The evaluation included 159 patients for surgical revascularization (CAD) and 71 patients for surgical heart valve disease (HVD) at three hospitals in Belem, Brazil.

C. pneumoniae is linked to a number of severe acute and chronic diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract including pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis and infection by the pathogen might play a role in lung cancer. Following adhesion, Chlamydiae secrete effector proteins into the host cytoplasm that modulate the actin cytoskeleton facilitating internalization and infection. Members of the conserved TarP protein family comprise such effector proteins that polymerize actin, and in the case of the C. trachomatis TarP protein, has been shown to play a critical role in pathogenesis. In a previous study, we demonstrated that, upon bacterial invasion, the C. pneumoniae TarP family member CPn0572 is secreted into the host cytoplasm and recruits and associates with actin via an actin-binding domain conserved in TarP proteins. We have now extended our analysis of CPn0572 and found that the CPn0572 actin binding and modulating capability is more complex. With the help of the fission yeast system, a second actin modulating domain was identified independent of the actin binding domain. Microscopic analysis of HEp-2 cells expressing different CPn0572 deletion variants mapped this domain to the C-terminal part of the protein as CPn0572536-755 binds F-actin in vitro and colocalizes with aberrantly thickened actin cables in vivo.

ESBL-producing bacteria are typically resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and result in a sizeable economic and public health burden. AmpC-producing Enterobacterales may develop third-generation cephalosporin resistance through enzyme hyper-expression. In no observational study has the outcome of treatment of these infections been surpassed by carbapenems. Widespread use of carbapenems may drive the development of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. METHODS: This study will use a multicentre, parallel group open-label non-inferiority trial design comparing ceftolozane-tazobactam and meropenem in adult patients with bloodstream infection caused by ESBL or AmpC-producing Enterobacterales. Trial recruitment will occur in up to 40 sites in six countries (Australia, Singapore, Italy, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon). The sample size is determined by a predefined quantity of ceftolozane-tazobactam to be supplied by Merck, Sharpe and Dohme (MSD). We anticipate that a trial with 600 patients contributing to the primary outcome analysis would have 80% power to declare non-inferiority with a 5% non-inferiority margin, assuming a 30-day mortality of 5% in both randomised groups. Once randomised, definitive treatment will be for a minimum of 5 days and a maximum of 14 days with the total duration determined by treating clinicians. Data describing demographic information, risk factors, concomitant antibiotics, illness scores, microbiology, multidrug-resistant organism screening, discharge and mortality will be collected. DISCUSSION: Participants will have bloodstream infection due to third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible E. coli and Klebsiella spp. or Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. or Serratia marcescens. They will be randomised 1:1 to ceftolozane-tazobactam 3 g versus meropenem 1 g, both every 8 h. Secondary outcomes will be a comparison of 14-day all-cause mortality, clinical and microbiological success at day 5, functional bacteraemia score, microbiological relapse, new bloodstream infection, length of hospital stay, serious adverse events, C. difficile infection, multidrug-resistant organism colonisation.

TPL-2 catalytic activity was demonstrated to induce phagosome acidification and proteolysis in primary mouse and human macrophages following uptake of latex beads. Quantitative proteomics revealed that blocking TPL-2 catalytic activity significantly altered the protein composition of phagosomes, particularly reducing the abundance of V-ATPase proton pump subunits. Furthermore, TPL-2 stimulated the phosphorylation of DMXL1, a regulator of V-ATPases, to induce V-ATPase assembly and phagosome acidification. Consistent with these results, TPL-2 catalytic activity was required for phagosome acidification and the efficient killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Citrobacter rodentium following phagocytic uptake by macrophages.

The aim of this study was to examine the resistance rates of less frequent uropathogenic Gram-negatives in a population of patients treated in a Department of Urology of a tertiary referral centre in Central Europe over a period of 9 years. METHODS: Data on all positive urine samples from urological in- and out-patients were extracted form the Department of Clinical Microbiology database from 2011 to 2019. Numbers of susceptible and resistant isolates per year were calculated for these uropathogens: Acinetobacter spp. (n = 74), Citrobacter spp. (n = 60), Enterobacter spp. (n = 250), Morganella morganii (n = 194), Providencia spp. (n = 53), Serratia spp. (n = 82) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 27). Antimicrobial agents selected for the survey included: ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam; cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and cefepime; ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin; gentamicin and amikacin; ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), nitrofurantoin and colistin. RESULTS: Penicillin derivatives have generally poor effect except piperacillin/tazobactam. Cefuroxime is not efficient unlike cefotaxime (except against Acinetobacter spp. and S. maltophilia). Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is limited. Amikacin is somewhat more efficient than gentamicine but susceptibilities for both safely exceed 80%. Nitrofurantoin shows virtually no efficiency. Cotrimoxazole acts well against Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp. and it is the treatment of choice for S. maltophilia UTIs. Among carbapenems, ertapenem was less efficient than meropenem and imipenem except for S. maltophilia whose isolates were mostly not suceptible to any carbapenems.

We aimed to elucidate the possible mechanisms of genetic transfer and dissemination of the blaKPC gene among isolates of this multispecies outbreak. A molecular epidemiology analysis of the above mentioned clinical isolates (n = 13) through Multi-Locus Sequence Typing, plasmid analysis, Pulsed-Field Gel-Electrophoresis, and Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed. RESULTS: High-risk sequence types were found: K. pneumoniae ST11, P. aeruginosa ST654, and E. cloacae ST114.

The ISec63-like element together with the blaKPC gene plus Tn4401 remnants were inserted in the Tra operon involved in conjugative transfer of the plasmid. This NTE was carried in a broad host-range IncN plasmid. P. aeruginosa isolates carried blaKPC gene embedded in a typical Tn4401b transposon in a different plasmid, suggesting that there was no plasmid transfer between Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa as initially hypothesized. CONCLUSIONS: Most enterobacterial isolates had blaKPC embedded in the same NTEKPC-IIe element, suggesting that this multispecies KPC outbreak was due to horizontal gene transfer rather than clonal spread. This poses a greater challenge to infection control measures often directed against containment of clonal spread.",1471-2180 (Electronic) 1471-2180 (Linking),2021 Apr 9,,"['10.1186/s12866-021-02169-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12866-021-02169-3 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae', 'Horizontal gene transfer', 'KPC Carbapenemase', 'Multispecies outbreak']",,,

Very few published data on IDFU exist in most West African countries. Objective: The study investigated the aetiology and antibacterial drug resistance burden of IDFU in tertiary hospitals in Osun state, Nigeria, between July 2016 and April 2017. Methods: Isolates were cultured from tissue biopsies or aspirates collected from patients with IDFU. Bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility testing and phenotypic detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase production were done by established protocols. Specific resistance genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Results: There were 218 microorganisms isolated from 93 IDFUs, comprising 129 (59.2%) Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), 59 (27.1%) Gram-positive cocci and 29 (13.3%) anaerobic bacteria. The top five facultative anaerobic bacteria isolated were: Staphylococcus aureus (34; 15.6%), Escherichia coli (23; 10.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20; 9.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19; 8.7%) and Citrobacter spp. (19; 8.7%). The most common anaerobes were Bacteroides spp. (7; 3.2%) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6; 2.8%). Seventy-four IDFUs (80%) were infected by multidrug-resistant bacteria, predominantly methicillin-resistant S. aureus and GNB producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, mainly of the CTX-M variety. Only 4 (3.1%) GNB produced carbapenemases encoded predominantly by bla VIM.

Consequently, WSD reduces microbiota density and promotes microbiota encroachment, potentially influencing colonization resistance, immune system readiness, and thus host defense against pathogenic bacteria. Here we examined the impact of WSD on infection and colitis in response to Citrobacter rodentium. We observed that, relative to mice consuming standard rodent grain-based chow (GBC), feeding WSD starkly altered the dynamics of Citrobacter infection, reducing initial colonization and inflammation but frequently resulting in persistent infection that associated with low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. WSD's reduction in initial Citrobacter virulence appeared to reflect that colons of GBC-fed mice contain microbiota metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, especially acetate, that drive Citrobacter growth and virulence. Citrobacter persistence in WSD-fed mice reflected inability of resident microbiota to out-compete it from the gut lumen, likely reflecting the profound impacts of WSD on microbiota composition.

The potential benefits of synthetic AMP in poultry production are examined, in the context of the use of AMP as alternatives to antimicrobial growth promoters (AGP).Since the mid-1950s, antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) have been used in feed at low prophylactic doses to modulate the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota, decreasing the risk of intestinal dysbacteriosis and the growth of pathogens within the avian gut. Over the last three decades, AGP have faced major regulatory restrictions due to concerns of generating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It is now well-documented that the rate of infectious disease outbreaks is higher in flocks which are not fed prophylactic antibiotics, resulting in a compensatory increase in antimicrobial use for therapeutic purposes.Endogenous natural AMP production is associated with the presence of microbiota and their interaction with the intestinal epithelial and lamina propria lymphoid cells. Their antimicrobial activity shapes the beneficial microbiota population and control intestinal pathogens such Clostridium and Salmonella spp., and stimulates the development and maturation of the local immune system.Similar to AGP, AMP can establish a well-balanced gut beneficial microbiota for adequate immune-competence, animal health and high growth performance parameters such as feed intake, daily weight, feed conversion and accumulated mortality.Antimicrobial proteins and peptides constitute an essential part of the innate immune system of all organisms and protect the host from invading pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites by interacting with the negatively charged pathogen membranes.",1466-1799 (Electronic) 0007-1668 (Linking),2021 Apr 28,,['10.1080/00071668.2021.1919993 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Prophylactic', 'antibiotic resistance', 'enteric pathogen', 'gastrointestinal tract', 'innate immunity']",,,

Molecular reorganization causes spontaneous weakening of these adhesions with age, resulting in the separation of the posterior hyaloid membrane (PHM) from the retina in what is called complete posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Incomplete separation of the posterior hyaloid or tight adherence or both can lead to retinal detachment, vitreomacular traction syndrome, or epiretinal membrane formation, which requires surgical intervention. Pharmacological vitrectomy has the potential of avoiding surgical vitrectomy; it is also useful as an adjunct during retinal surgery to induce PVD. Previously studied enzymatic reagents, such as collagenase derived from Clostridium histolyticum, are nonspecific and potentially toxic. We studied a novel collagenase from Vibrio mimicus (VMC) which remains active (VMA), even after deletion of 51 C-terminal amino acids. To limit the activity of VMA to the vitreous cavity, a fusion construct (inhibitor of hyaluronic acid-VMA [iHA-VMA]) was made in which a 12-mer peptide (iHA, which binds to HA) was fused to the N-terminus of VMA. The construct was evaluated in the context of PVD. Methods: VMA and iHA-VMA were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized with gelatin zymography, collagen degradation assay, fluorescamine-based assay, and cell-based assays. Two sets of experiments were performed in New Zealand albino rabbits. Group A (n = 10) received iHA-VMA, while group B (n = 5) received the equivalent dose of VMA. In both groups, saline was injected as a control in the contralateral eyes. Animals were monitored with indirect ophthalmoscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and B-scan ultrasonography. Retinal toxicity was assessed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of retinal tissue. Results: The activity of iHA-VMA and VMA was comparable and 65-fold lower than that of C. histolyticum collagenase Type IV. In the iHA-VMA group, all the rabbits (n = 10) developed PVD, with complete PVD seen in six animals. No statistically significant histomorphological changes were seen. In the VMA group, four of the five rabbits developed complete PVD; however, retinal morphological changes were seen in two animals. Conclusions: iHA-VMA displays targeted action confined to the vitreous and shows potential for safe pharmacologic vitreolysis.",1090-0535 (Electronic) 1090-0535 (Linking),2021,,['11 [pii]'],['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Molecular Vision.'],,

METHODS AND RESULTS: PM is rich in nutrients and contains more than 26% crude protein in dry matter. After ensiling, the microbial diversity and abundance in PM, CM, and RB decreased due to the anaerobic environment and acidic conditions. The CM-treated PM silage accelerated the conversion of the dominant microbial community from harmful bacteria to lactic acid bacteria and promoted lactic acid fermentation. When RB was used to treat PM silage, Enterobacter and Clostridium species became the main bacterial community during ensiling, leading to butyric acid fermentation and protein decomposition. Compared with RB, CM increased the amount of fermentation substrates, changed the microbial community structure, and affected metabolic pathways (global metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid metabolism), which improved the flavour and quality of the PM silage. CONCLUSIONS: The CM addition of improved the fermentation quality of PM silage, with PM + CM being the ideal combination. The SMRT sequencing technology could accurately obtain specific details of the microbial networks and fermentation characteristics. Our results indicate that PM can be used as a potential high-protein silage in animal production. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In tropics, the effective use of abundant natural biomass resources such as woody plants to prepare silage for feed preservation can solve the problem of restricting livestock production due to the shortage of feed in the dry season.

To follow the adaptive response of the biomass-attached cellulolytic/hydrolytic biofilms at increasing ammonium/ammonia contents, genome-centered metagenomics and transcriptional profiling based on metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) were conducted. RESULTS: In total, 78 bacterial and archaeal MAGs representing the most abundant members of the communities, and featuring defined quality criteria were selected and characterized in detail. Determination of MAG abundances under the tested conditions by mapping of the obtained metagenome sequence reads to the MAGs revealed that MAG abundance profiles were mainly shaped by the temperature but also by the OLR. However, the OLR effect was more pronounced for the mesophilic systems as compared to the thermophilic ones. In contrast, metatranscriptome mapping to MAGs subsequently normalized to MAG abundances showed that under thermophilic conditions, MAGs respond to increased OLRs by shifting their transcriptional activities mainly without adjusting their proliferation rates. This is a clear difference compared to the behavior of the microbiome under mesophilic conditions. Here, the response to increased OLRs involved adjusting of proliferation rates and corresponding transcriptional activities. The analysis led to the identification of MAGs positively responding to increased OLRs. The most outstanding MAGs in this regard, obviously well adapted to higher OLRs and/or associated conditions, were assigned to the order Clostridiales (Acetivibrio sp.) for the mesophilic biofilm and the orders Bacteroidales (Prevotella sp. and an unknown species), Lachnospirales (Herbinix sp. and Kineothrix sp.) and Clostridiales (Clostridium sp.) for the thermophilic biofilm. Genome-based metabolic reconstruction and transcriptional profiling revealed that positively responding MAGs mainly are involved in hydrolysis of grass silage, acidogenesis and / or acetogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated -omics approach enabled the identification of new AD biofilm keystone species featuring outstanding performance under stress conditions such as increased OLRs. Genome-based knowledge on the metabolic potential and transcriptional activity of responsive microbiome members will contribute to the development of improved microbiological AD management strategies for biomethanation of renewable biomass.",2524-6372 (Electronic) 2524-6372 (Linking),2020 Mar 2,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4830-310X'],"['10.1186/s40793-020-00354-x [doi]', '10.1186/s40793-020-00354-x [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Anaerobic digestion', 'Bioconversion', 'Biogas', 'Integrated -omics', 'Metabolic activity', 'Metagenome assembled genomes', 'Methane', 'Microbial community structure', 'Polyomics']",,,

Isolated systolic HTN (ISH) and isolated diastolic HTN (IDH) are two important subtypes of HTN. Previous researches have demonstrated the alteration of fecal bacteria in HTN, but not down to these two sub-types. In order to identify whether the composition of bacterial taxa and functional modules shift in ISH and IDH, we performed a metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 15 controls, 14 ISH, and 11 IDH. RESULTS: Compared with control and ISH, IDH patients showed decreased gene number, bacterial richness, and evenness, although the bacterial alterations did not reach statistical significance in the Shannon index. Also, at the genus level, the beta-diversity for intestinal flora in IDH was distinguishable from those with ISH. Furthermore, the taxonomic composition of ISH or IDH was different from that of healthy control at genus and species levels. Patients with IDH or ISH were confirmed to be enriched with Rothia mucilaginosa, along with reduced Clostridium sp. ASBs410. Lastly, the altered KEGG modules were significantly decreased in IDH compared with the control group, such as sodium transport system; while for ISH, functions relevant to biotin biosynthesis were decreased.

Colon is one of a very susceptible tissues to Wnt signaling pathway, and so it would be very essential to explore the toxic effect of a high dose of LiCl on colon. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 mg/kg LiCl one dose a day for 5 days to activate this signal pathway in intestines. H&E staining was used to assess the colonic tissues of mice treated with high dose of LiCl. The expression of inflammation-associated genes and tight junction-associated genes was measured using qPCR, Western blot and immunostaining methods. The gut microbiome was tested through 16S rDNA gene analysis. RESULTS: The differentiation of enteroendocrine cells in colon was inhibited by treatment of 200 mg/kg LiCl. The F4/80 positive macrophages in colon were activated by high dose of LiCl, and migrated from the submucosa to the lamina propria. The expression of pro-inflammatory genes TNFalpha and IL-1beta was increased in the colon of high dose of LiCl treated mice. Clostridium_sp_k4410MGS_306 and Prevotellaceae_UCG_001 were specific and predominant for the high dose of LiCl treated mice. The expression of IgA coding genes, Pigr and Claudin-15 was significantly decreased in the colon tissues of the high dose of LiCl treated mice. CONCLUSION: 200 mg/kg LiCl might cause the inflammation in colon of mice through activating F4/80 positive macrophages and inhibiting the expression of IgA coding genes in plasma cells and the expression of Pigr and Claudin-15 in colonic epithelial cells, providing evidences for the toxic effects of high dose of LiCl on colon.",1879-3185 (Electronic) 0300-483X (Linking),2021 Apr 23,,"['S0300-483X(21)00122-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tox.2021.152799 [doi]']",['eng'],Ireland,"['Colitis', 'Gut microbiota', 'Immune homeostasis', 'Lithium chloride', 'Tight junction', 'Wnt signaling pathway']",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Approximately 20 cases are reported in the United States each year, mostly from California. Most wound botulism cases occur in drug injectors, particularly among those using black tar heroin. The initial presentation of botulism may overlap with other diagnoses, including opioid intoxication and pre-existing neurological disease, making accurate diagnosis difficult. A healthy 40-year-old patient with a history of injecting black tar heroin presented to an emergency department complaining of generalized weakness and throat discomfort. He was given antibiotics and was sent home. The next day, the patient presented to another emergency department with additional complaints of slurred speech and blurring of vision. He was admitted for a possible cerebrovascular injury. In the absence of positive findings from laboratory or imaging studies, botulism was considered. The patient decompensated and was intubated. Botulism antitoxin was given, and the patient eventually recovered. Prompt decision-making based on clinical suspicion and an informed presumptive diagnosis, administration of botulism antitoxin, and aggressive provision of supportive care can arrest the progression of paralysis and be life-saving.

Available treatments including an equine antitoxin and human immune globulin are given post-exposure and challenging to produce and administer. NTM-1632 is an equimolar mixture of 3 human IgG monoclonal antibodies, B1, B2, and B3, targeting BoNT serotype B (BoNT/B). This first-in-human study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of NTM-1632.MethodsThis double-blind, single-center, placebo-controlled dose escalation study, randomized 3 cohorts of healthy volunteers to receive a single intravenous dose of NTM-1632 (0.033, 0.165, or 0.330 mg/kg) or saline placebo. Safety monitoring included physical examinations, clinical laboratory studies, and vital signs. Blood sampling was performed at pre-specified time points for PK and immunogenicity analyses.ResultsTwenty-four subjects received study product (18 NTM-1632; 6 placebo), and no deaths or serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events in the NTM-1632 groups were generally mild and similar in frequency and severity to the placebo group, and no safety signal was identified. NTM-1632 has a favorable PK profile with a half-life >20 days for the 0.330 mg/kg dose and an approximately linear relationship with respect to maximum concentration and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-->t). NTM-1632 demonstrated low immunogenicity with only a few treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody responses in the low and middle dosing groups and none at the highest dose.InterpretationNTM-1632 is well-tolerated at the administered doses. The favorable safety, PK, and immunogenicity profile of NTM-1632 supports further clinical development as a treatment for BoNT/B intoxication and post-exposure prophylaxis.",1098-6596 (Electronic) 0066-4804 (Linking),2021 Apr 19,,"['AAC.02329-20 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.02329-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Guptill et al.'],,

The peptide is labelled with the electroactive molecule methylene blue and immobilized on the paper-based electrode modified with gold nanoparticles. Because BoNT/A and BoNT/C can cleave the peptide with the removal of methylene blue from electrode surface, the presence of these neurotoxins in the sample leads to a signal decrease proportional to BoNT amount. The biosensor developed with the selected peptide and combined with smartphone assisted potentiostat is able to detect both BoNT/A and BoNT/C with a linearity up to 1 nM and a detection limit equal to 10 pM.

Specific binding and internalization of BoNT/A into neuronal cells is mediated by its binding domain (HC/A), which binds to gangliosides, including GT1b, and protein cell surface receptors, including SV2. Previously, recombinant HC/A was also shown to bind to FGFR3. As FGFR dimerization is an indirect measure of ligand-receptor binding, an FCS & TIRF receptor dimerization assay was developed to measure rHC/A-induced dimerization of fluorescently tagged FGFR subtypes (FGFR1-3) in cells. rHC/A dimerized FGFR subtypes in the rank order FGFR3c (EC50 approximately 27 nM) > FGFR2b (EC50 approximately 70 nM) > FGFR1c (EC50 approximately 163 nM); rHC/A dimerized FGFR3c with similar potency as the native FGFR3c ligand, FGF9 (EC50 approximately 18 nM). Mutating the ganglioside binding site in HC/A, or removal of GT1b from the media, resulted in decreased dimerization. Interestingly, reduced dimerization was also observed with an SV2 mutant variant of HC/A. Overall, the results suggest that the FCS & TIRF receptor dimerization assay can assess FGFR dimerization with known and novel ligands and support a model wherein HC/A, either directly or indirectly, interacts with FGFRs and induces receptor dimerization.",2045-2322 (Electronic) 2045-2322 (Linking),2021 Apr 9,,"['10.1038/s41598-021-87331-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-87331-7 [pii]']",['eng'],England,,,,

The new growth and growth boundary model included the inhibiting interactive effect between these factors and it was calibrated using growth curves from 10 challenge tests with unprocessed seafood. For model evaluation, 40 challenge tests with well characterized fresh and lightly preserved seafood were performed. Comparison of these observed growth curves and growth rates (mumax-values) predicted by the new model resulted in a bias factor (Bf) of 1.12 and an accuracy factor (Af) of 1.40. Furthermore, the new model was evaluated with 94 growth rates and 432 time to toxin formation data extracted from the scientific literature for seafood, poultry, meat, pasta and prepared meals. These data included responses for 36 different toxigenic strains of non-proteolytic C. botulinum. The obtained Bf-/Af-values were 0.97/2.04 for mumax-values and 0.96/1.80 for time to toxin formation. The model correctly predicted 93.8% of the growth responses with 5.6% being fail-safe and <1% fail-dangerous. A cocktail of four non-toxin producing Clostridium spp. isolates was used to develop the new model and these isolates had more than 99.8% 16S rRNA gene similarity to non-proteolytic C. botulinum (Group II). The high number of environmental factors included in the new model makes it a flexible tool to facilitate development or reformulation of seafood and poultry products that do not support the growth of non-proteolytic C. botulinum.

Thus, the application of exogenous neurotrophic factors such as the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to increase SGN survival in vitro and in vivo is a promising pharmacological approach in cochlear implant (CI) research. Due to the difficult pharmacokinetic profile of proteins such as BDNF, there is a quest for small molecules to mediate the survival of SGN or to increase the efficacy of BDNF. The C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum could be a potential new candidate for the protection and regeneration of SGN. Inhibition of the RhoA GTPase pathway which can be mediated by C3 is described as a promising strategy to enhance axonal regeneration and to exert pro-survival signals in neurons. Nanomolar concentrations of C3, its enzymatically inactive form C3(E174Q), and a 26mer C-terminal peptide fragment covering amino acid 156-181 (C3(156-181)) potentiated the neuroprotective effect on SGN mediated by BDNF in vitro.

The C. difficile Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CDARS) study is nationwide longitudinal surveillance of C. difficile infection (CDI) in Australia. OBJECTIVES: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of C. difficile isolated in Australia between 2015 and 2018. METHODS: A total of 1091 strains of C. difficile were collected over a 3 year period by a network of 10 diagnostic microbiology laboratories in five Australian states. These strains were tested for their susceptibility to nine antimicrobials using the CLSI agar incorporation method. RESULTS: All strains were susceptible to metronidazole, fidaxomicin, rifaximin and amoxicillin/clavulanate and low numbers of resistant strains were observed for meropenem (0.1%; 1/1091), moxifloxacin (3.5%; 38/1091) and vancomycin (5.7%; 62/1091).

In this study, we identified and characterized a new cell wall hydrolase Cwl0971 (CDR20291_0971) from C. difficile R20291, which is involved in bacterial autolysis. The gene 0971 deletion mutant (R20291Delta0971) generated with CRISPR-AsCpfI exhibited significantly delayed cell autolysis and increased cell viability compared to R20291, and the purified Cwl0971 exhibited hydrolase activity for Bacillus subtilis cell wall. Meanwhile, 0971 gene deletion impaired TcdA and TcdB release due to the decreased cell autolysis in the stationary/late phase of cell growth. Moreover, sporulation of the mutant strain decreased significantly compared to the wild type strain. In vivo, the defect of Cwl0971 decreased fitness over the parent strain in a mouse infection model. Collectively, Cwl0971 is involved in cell wall lysis and cell viability, which affects toxin release, sporulation, germination, and pathogenicity of R20291, indicating that Cwl0971 could be an attractive target for C. difficile infection therapeutics and prophylactics.",1462-2920 (Electronic) 1462-2912 (Linking),2021 Apr 24,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8048-2171', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6561-7931']",['10.1111/1462-2920.15529 [doi]'],['eng'],England,,['(c) 2021 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,

While commonly associated with trauma, clostridial myonecrosis may be the result of parenteral injection of medications. Epinephrine is the most commonly reported medication leading to gas gangrene. CASE REPORT A 60-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with ""the worst pain in his life"" to the right thigh near the site at which he auto-injected epinephrine after multiple bee stings 10-11 h prior to arrival. Initial heart rate was 112 beats/min but all other vital signs were unremarkable at presentation. Due to extreme pain, a computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered, revealing prominent gas within the anterior compartment of the right thigh, mostly involving the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris, suggesting necrotizing fasciitis. Antimicrobials were initiated immediately and the patient was taken for surgical debridement within 70 min after obtaining the CT results. Clostridium perfringens was cultured from the patient's tissue. After several surgical debridement's, appropriate antimicrobial therapy, supportive care, and wound care, the patient's limb remained intact and he was discharged after 11 days.

In total, 579 samples from a broiler farm and 378 samples from the slaughterhouse were collected from a large-scale rearing and slaughter one-stop enterprise in Weifang, China, between June and July 2019, of which 30.40% of the samples from farm and 54.50% of samples from slaughterhouse were determined to be positive for C. perfringens, respectively. The contamination of chicken products was relatively serious, with the total positive rate of carcasses at 59.73%; the positive rate of carcass samples was the highest in the evisceration process, which might be the critical point of C. perfringens contamination. A total of 476 isolates of C. perfringens were recovered; and 99.58% of recovered isolates were identified as type A, with the remaining isolates being type G. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 97.15% of the isolates showed multiple antibiotic resistance and 67.89% of them were resistant to at least five classes of commonly used antibiotics. Multilocus sequence typing results of 91 representative isolates showed that the isolates can be divided into 74 sequences types (STs); 40.66% of the isolates can be included into seven clonal complexes (CCs). Although most of the isolates were classified as type A, considerable genetic diversity was observed, with the Simpson's diversity index of ST up to 0.9902. Some isolates from farm stage and slaughter stage were distributed in the same ST or CC, indicating that chicken products may be contaminated by the same ST or CC of C. perfringens originated from the farm stage.

Type F strains produce an enterotoxin (CpE) that causes the third most common foodborne illness in the United States. CpE induces gut breakdown by disrupting barriers at cell-cell contacts called tight junctions (TJs), which are formed and maintained by claudins. Targeted binding of CpE to specific claudins, encoded by its C-terminal domain (cCpE), loosens TJ barriers to trigger molecular leaks between cells. Cytotoxicity results from claudin-bound CpE complexes forming pores in cell membranes. In mammalian tissues, approximately 24 claudins govern TJ barriers-but the basis for CpE's selective targeting of claudins in the gut was undetermined. We report the structure of human claudin-4 in complex with cCpE, which reveals that enterotoxin targets a motif conserved in receptive claudins and how the motif imparts high-affinity CpE binding to these but not other subtypes. The structural basis of CpE targeting is supported by binding affinities, kinetics, and half-lives of claudin-enterotoxin complexes and by the cytotoxic effects of CpE on claudin-expressing cells. By correlating the binding residence times of claudin-CpE complexes we determined to claudin expression patterns in the gut, we uncover that the primary CpE receptors differ in mice and humans due to sequence changes in the target motif. These findings provide the molecular and structural element CpE employs for subtype-specific targeting of claudins during pathogenicity of C. perfringens in the gut and a framework for new strategies to treat CpE-based illnesses in domesticated mammals and humans.",1091-6490 (Electronic) 0027-8424 (Linking),2021 Apr 13,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4222-7874', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2083-5665']","['2024651118 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2024651118 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['X-ray structure', 'claudin', 'enterotoxin', 'membrane protein', 'tight junction']",['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

The virulence of this Gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobe is largely attributable to its copious toxin production; the diverse actions and roles in infection of these toxins are now becoming established. Most C. perfringens toxin genes are encoded on conjugative plasmids, including the pCW3-like and the recently discovered pCP13-like plasmid families. Production of C. perfringens toxins is highly regulated via processes involving two-component regulatory systems, quorum sensing and/or sporulation-related alternative sigma factors. Non-toxin factors, such as degradative enzymes like sialidases, are also now being implicated in the pathogenicity of this bacterium. These factors can promote toxin action in vitro and, perhaps in vivo, and also enhance C. perfringens intestinal colonization, e.g. NanI sialidase increases C. perfringens adherence to intestinal tissue and generates nutrients for its growth, at least in vitro.

OBJECTIVE: To identify additional anti-microbial antibodies inclusion of which in the classical MRZ panel may result in increased sensitivity without compromising the marker's high specificity for MS. METHODS: We determined the antibody indices (AIs) for 11 viral and bacterial agents (M, R, Z, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, mumps virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Clostridium tetani) in paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples from patients with MS and disease controls. RESULTS: A positive 'classical' MRZ reaction was found in 17/26 (65.4%) MS patients.

The regulation of toxin expression is complex and involves the alternative sigma factor TetR as well as other regulators. Here, a transcriptional analysis of the TeNT-encoding large plasmid of C. tetani identified a putative non-coding small RNA (sRNA), located in close vicinity of the 3' untranslated region of the tent gene. A northern blot experiment could identify a respective sRNA with a size of approx. 140 nucleotides. Sequence analysis showed that the sRNA contains a 14-nucleotide region that is complementary to a 5' located region of tent. In order to investigate the function of the sRNA, we applied a RNA interference approach targeting the sRNA in two C. tetani wild-type strains; the constructed antisense C. tetani strains showed an approx. threefold increase in both extracellular and total TeNT production compared to the respective wild-type strains. In addition, recombinant C. tetani strains were constructed that contained tent-locus harboring plasmids with and without the sRNA. However, the introduction of the tent-locus without the sRNA in a C. tetani strain lacking the wild-type TeNT-encoding large plasmid resulted in a lower TeNT production compared to the same strain with recombinant tent-locus with the sRNA. This suggests that the expression or the effect of the sRNA is modulated by the C. tetani genetic background, notably that of the wild-type TeNT-encoding large plasmid. In addition, some recombinant strains exhibited modulated growth patterns, characterized by premature bacterial cell lysis. Taken together, our data indicate that the sRNA acts as a negative regulator of TeNT synthesis, with a possible impact on the growth of C. tetani.

It has a high disease burden in low and middle-income countries. Tetanus is caused by a toxin made by spores of the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which are found in soil, dust, and animal feces. The toxin impairs the motor neurons leading to muscle stiffness. However, with the development of a toxoid vaccine, the incidence has sharply declined and is now categorized as a vaccine-preventable disease. The treatment of tetanus is primarily supportive and focuses on managing the complications until the effects of toxins resolve. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 67-year-old farmer who previously sustained a laceration injury approximately 45 days prior to presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain and rigidity. After a comprehensive evaluation to rule out other items in the differential diagnoses, he was diagnosed with tetanus based on clinical symptoms and ultimately required mechanical ventilation. The patient was then managed in the intensive care unit and later made an uneventful recovery. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates an uncommon presentation of tetanus and the latency of the infectious process. Often when patients present with atypical symptoms, it poses a diagnostic dilemma to the clinicians. Thus, it is very important to carefully elicit a history of contaminated injury. This case also highlights the importance of prophylactic vaccine in low and middle-income countries, which can reduce disease-related mortality and morbidity.",2474-252X (Electronic) 2474-252X (Linking),2020 Nov,,"['cpcem.2020.8.49073 [pii]', '10.5811/cpcem.2020.8.49073 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

To prevent infections, a toxoid vaccine, developed almost a century ago, is routinely used in humans and animals. The vaccine is listed in the World Health Organisation list of Essential Medicines and can be produced and administered very cheaply in the developing world for less than one US Dollar per dose. Recent developments in both analytical tools and frameworks for systems biology provide industry with an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the parameters that determine C. tetani virulence and physiological behaviour in bioreactors. Here, we compared a traditional fermentation process with a fermentation medium supplemented with five heavily consumed amino acids. The experiment demonstrated that amino acid catabolism plays a key role in the virulence of C. tetani. The addition of the five amino acids favoured growth, decreased toxin production and changed C. tetani morphology. Using time-course transcriptomics, we created a ""fermentation map"", which shows that the tetanus toxin transcriptional regulator BotR, P21 and the tetanus toxin gene was downregulated. Moreover, this in-depth analysis revealed potential genes that might be involved in C. tetani virulence regulation. We observed differential expression of genes related to cell separation, surface/cell adhesion, pyrimidine biosynthesis and salvage, flagellar motility, and prophage genes. Overall, the fermentation map shows that, mediated by free amino acid concentrations, virulence in C. tetani is regulated at the transcriptional level and affects a plethora of metabolic functions.",1476-5535 (Electronic) 1367-5435 (Linking),2020 Dec,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3173-7956'],"['10.1007/s10295-020-02330-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10295-020-02330-3 [pii]']",['eng'],Germany,"['Amino acids', 'Clostridium tetani fermentation', 'Pathogenesis', 'Tetanus toxin regulation', 'Time-course transcriptomics']",,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Tetanus Toxin)']","['*Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Clostridium tetani/genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Tetanus Toxin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcriptome']"

These hair-like structures, although very thin (1 to 5 nm), exhibit impressive tensile strengths because their protein components (pilins) are covalently crosslinked together via lysine-isopeptide bonds by pilus-specific sortase enzymes. While atomic structures of isolated pilins have been determined, how they are joined together by sortases and how these interpilin crosslinks stabilize pilus structure are poorly understood. Using a reconstituted pilus assembly system and hybrid structural biology methods, we elucidated the solution structure and dynamics of the crosslinked interface that is repeated to build the prototypical SpaA pilus from Corynebacterium diphtheriae We show that sortase-catalyzed introduction of a K190-T494 isopeptide bond between adjacent SpaA pilins causes them to form a rigid interface in which the LPLTG sorting signal is inserted into a large binding groove. Cellular and quantitative kinetic measurements of the crosslinking reaction shed light onto the mechanism of pilus biogenesis. We propose that the pilus-specific sortase in C. diphtheriae uses a latch mechanism to select K190 on SpaA for crosslinking in which the sorting signal is partially transferred from the enzyme to a binding groove in SpaA in order to facilitate catalysis.

To date, however, nothing is known about this process in the diphtheria-causative pathogen Corynebacterium diphtheriae, nor is known the identity of this ribonuclease in this organism. Here, we report that C. diphtheriae DIP1463 encodes a predicted RnJ homolog, comprised of a conserved N-terminal beta-lactamase domain, followed by beta-CASP and C-terminal domains. A recombinant protein encompassing the beta-lactamase domain alone displays 5'-exoribonuclease activity, which is abolished by alanine-substitution of the conserved catalytic residues His(186) and His(188). Intriguingly, deletion of DIP1463/rnj in C. diphtheriae reduces bacterial growth and generates cell shape abnormality with markedly augmented cell width. Comparative RNA-seq analysis revealed that RnJ controls a large regulon encoding many factors predicted to be involved in biosynthesis, regulation, transport, and iron acquisition. One upregulated gene in the rnj mutant is ftsH, coding for a membrane protease (FtsH) involved in cell division, whose overexpression in the wild-type strain also caused cell-width augmentation. Critically, the rnj mutant is severely attenuated in virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of infection, while the FtsH-overexpressing and toxin-less strains exhibit full virulence as the wild-type strain. Evidently, RNase J is a key ribonuclease in C. diphtheriae that post-transcriptionally influences the expression of numerous factors vital to corynebacterial cell physiology and virulence.

Isolation of C. diphtheriae is technically lacking in sensitivity, and Elek's test to detect toxin production has several difficulties associated with its application. Duplex real-time PCR to throat swab of suspected diphtheria patients can detect both bacteria and toxin-encoding genes simultaneously, faster, with higher sensitivity and specificity. Materials and Methods: A total of 89 consecutive throat swabs from suspected diphtheria patients were collected from Sulianti Saroso Infectious Disease Hospital, Jakarta, during 2018 to 2019. Two pairs of primers and probes, targeting the rpoB gene of C. diphtheriae and the A-subunit of the diphtheria toxin gene, were used in this study. Parameters including annealing temperature, concentration of primers and probes, inhibitors, cross-reaction and detection limit were all optimized. Elek's toxigenicity test and clinical data were analyzed for comparison. Results: The optimum annealing temperature was 55 degrees C. The concentrations of Cd primer, Tox primer, Cd probe and Tox probe were 0.4, 0.6, 0.5 and 0.625 microM, respectively. DNA elution and template volumes were 50 microL and 5 microL.

In line with these findings, the correlation between periodontitis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular incidences has been repetitively supported by evidence from a number of experimental studies. However, the direct role of periodontal pathogens in altered cellular signaling underlying such cardiovascular events has not been clearly defined. To determine the role of periodontal pathogens in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, especially in the evolution of macrophages into foam cells, we monitored the pattern of lipid accumulation within macrophages in the presence of periodontal pathogens, followed by characterization of these lipids and investigation of major molecules involved in lipid homeostasis. The cells were stained with the lipophilic fluorescent dye BODIPY 493/503 and Oil Red O to characterize the lipid profile. The amounts of Oil Red O-positive droplets, representing neutral lipids, as well as fluorescent lipid aggregates were prominently increased in periodontal pathogen-infected macrophages. Subsequent analysis allowed us to locate the accumulated lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, the levels of cholesteryl ester in periodontal pathogen-infected macrophages were increased, implying disrupted lipid homeostasis. Further investigations to delineate the key messengers and regulatory factors involved in the altered lipid homeostasis have revealed alterations in cholesterol efflux-related enzymes, such as ABCG1 and CYP46A1, as contributors to foam cell formation, and increased Ca(2+) signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as key events underlying disrupted lipid homeostasis. Consistently, a treatment of periodontal pathogen-infected macrophages with ROS inhibitors and nifedipine attenuated the accumulation of lipid droplets, further confirming periodontal pathogen-induced alterations in Ca(2+) and ROS signaling and the subsequent dysregulation of lipid homeostasis as key regulatory events underlying the evolution of macrophages into foam cells.",1544-0591 (Electronic) 0022-0345 (Linking),2021 Apr 24,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4050-5797', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1908-0824']",['10.1177/00220345211008811 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['ATP-binding cassette transporters G1 (ABCG1)', 'Fusobacterium nucleatum', 'Porphyromonas gingivalis', 'foam cells', 'lipid metabolism', 'macrophages']",,,

METHODOLOGY: For the in vivo experiments, expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3) was inhibited using an adeno-associated virus and then the Balb/c mice model of AP was established by injecting Fn into the root canal of the first mandibular molars. Bone loss and number of osteoclasts was measured via micro-computed tomography and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining respectively; expression of RIP3 and phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL) was detected by immunohistochemistry and western blotting; expression of mRNA of inflammatory cytokines was evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). For the in vitro experiments, L929 cells transfected with RIP3-Mus-siRNA or negative control siRNA were co-cultured with Fn; thereafter, western blotting, detection of cell death and viability, and qRT-PCR analyses were performed to assess the activation of necroptosis pathway and expression of mRNA of inflammatory cytokines. Data were analysed with unpaired t-test and one-way analysis of variance with significance set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: The Fn-induced apical lesions displayed apical bone loss, an increased number of osteoclasts, enhanced expression of pMLKL, and increased mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines(IL-1alpha and IL-1beta); all these effects were alleviated by RIP3 inhibition (P<0.05). L929 cells infected with Fn displayed increased expression of pMLKL and increased cell death(P<0.05), together with decreased cell viability (P<0.05), while transfection with RIP3-Mus-siRNA decreased the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines(TNF-alpha and IL-6, P<0.05).

Black cumin seed essential oil (BC oil) reportedly exhibits deodorizing activity against methyl mercaptan. Therefore, we hypothesized that BC oil may also suppress methyl mercaptan production. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of BC oil on L-methionine-gamma-lyase activity in Fusobacterium nucleatum. Recombinant L-methionine-gamma-lyase was incubated under appropriate conditions with BC oil and its constituent thymoquinone. To analyze L-methionine-gamma-lyase activity, alpha-ketobutyric acid and ammonia concentrations were determined. The concentrations of alpha-ketobutyric acid and ammonia were significantly decreased by 10 microg mL-1 of BC oil (P < 0.01) and 16.4 microg mL-1 of thymoquinone (P < 0.05). An enzyme kinetic assay showed a mixed inhibition pattern between L-methionine-gamma-lyase and thymoquinone. In conclusion, BC oil not only had a deodorizing effect against methyl mercaptan but also an inhibitory effect on methyl mercaptan production through the suppression of L-methionine-gamma-lyase activity. Thymoquinone may be mainly responsible for these effects of BC oil.

This study aimed to assess the frequency of Fusobacterium nucleatum in primary and secondary endodontic infections and its associations with the clinical features in a Brazilian population by using both culture and nested PCR methods. METHODS: A total of 100 microbial samples from patients with primary (n=50) and secondary endodontic infections (n=50) were analyzed by using culture and nested PCR methods. Strict anaerobic techniques were used for culture and identification of F. nucleatum. The DNA extracted from the samples was analyzed for the presence of target species by using species-specific primers. RESULTS: Culture and nested PCR methods detected F. nucleatum, respectively, in 11/100 and 82/100 root canals. F. nucleatum was isolated by culture from 10/50 (20%) root canals with primary infections and from 1/50 (2%) root canal with secondary/persistent infections.

As with other cancers, CRC is a multifactorial disease due to the combined effect of genetic and environmental factors. Most cases are sporadic, but a small proportion is hereditary, estimated at around 5-10%. In both, the tumor interacts with heterogeneous cell populations, such as endothelial, stromal, and immune cells, secreting different signals (cytokines, chemokines or growth factors) to generate a favorable tumor microenvironment for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. There is ample evidence that inflammatory processes have a role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression in CCR. Different profiles of cell activation of the tumor microenvironment can promote pro or anti-tumor pathways; hence they are studied as a key target for the control of cancer progression. Additionally, the intestinal mucosa is in close contact with a microorganism community, including bacteria, bacteriophages, viruses, archaea, and fungi composing the gut microbiota. Aberrant composition of this microbiota, together with alteration in the diet-derived microbial metabolites content (such as butyrate and polyamines) and environmental compounds has been related to CRC. Some bacteria, such as pks+ Escherichia coli or Fusobacterium nucleatum, are involved in colorectal carcinogenesis through different pathomechanisms including the induction of genetic mutations in epithelial cells and modulation of tumor microenvironment. Epithelial and immune cells from intestinal mucosa have Pattern-recognition receptors and G-protein coupled receptors (receptor of butyrate), suggesting that their activation can be regulated by intestinal microbiota and metabolites. In this review, we discuss how dynamics in the gut microbiota, their metabolites, and tumor microenvironment interplays in sporadic and hereditary CRC, modulating tumor progression.",1664-3224 (Electronic) 1664-3224 (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fimmu.2021.612826 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['colorectal cancer', 'diet-derived metabolites', 'immune system', 'intestinal microbiota', 'tumor micronvironment (TME)']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Hanus, Parada-Venegas, Landskron, Wielandt, Hurtado, Alvarez,', 'Hermoso, Lopez-Kostner and De la Fuente.']",,

RESULTS: The tyrosine phenol lyase from Fusobacterium nucleatum was constitutively expressed in E. coli and a fed-batch fermentation process with temperature down-shift cultivation was performed. Efficient strategies including replacing the original ampicillin resistance gene, as well as inserting cer site that is active for resolving plasmid multimers were applied. As a result, the plasmid stability was increased. The co-use of cer site on plasmid and kanamycin in culture medium resulted in proportion of plasmid containing cells maintained at 100% after fermentation for 35 h. The specific activity of tyrosine phenol lyase reached 1493 U/g dcw, while the volumetric activity increased from 2943 to 14,408 U/L for L-DOPA biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The established strategies for plasmid stability is not only promoted the applicability of the recombinant cells for L-DOPA production, but also provides important guidance for industrial fermentation with improved microbial productivity.",1573-6776 (Electronic) 0141-5492 (Linking),2021 Apr 8,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9682-1759'],"['10.1007/s10529-021-03082-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10529-021-03082-5 [pii]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Fed-batch fermentation', 'Plasmid stability', 'Temperature down-shift cultivation', 'Tyrosine phenol lyase', 'cis-Acting plasmid site']",,,

BACKGROUND: Respiratory diphtheria is a toxin-mediated disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Diphtheria-like illness, clinically indistinguishable from diphtheria, is caused by C. ulcerans, a zoonotic bacterium that can also produce diphtheria toxin. In the United States, respiratory diphtheria is nationally notifiable: specimens from suspected cases are submitted to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for species and toxin confirmation, and diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) is obtained from CDC for treatment. We summarize the epidemiology of respiratory diphtheria and diphtheria-like illness and describe DAT use during 1996-2018 in the United States. METHODS: We described respiratory diphtheria cases reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and C. ulcerans-related diphtheria-like illness identified through specimen submissions to CDC during 1996-2018. We reviewed DAT requests from 1997-2018. RESULTS: From 1996-2018, 14 respiratory diphtheria cases were reported to NNDSS. Among these 14 cases, 1 was toxigenic and 3 were non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae by culture and Elek, 6 were culture-negative but PCR-positive for diphtheria toxin gene, 1 was culture-positive without further testing, and the remaining 3 were either not tested or tested negative. Five cases of respiratory diphtheria-like illness caused by toxigenic C. ulcerans were identified. DAT was requested by healthcare providers for 151 suspected diphtheria cases between 1997-2018, with an average of 11 requests per year from 1997-2007, and 3 per year from 2008-2018.

The recommended first-line antibiotic is penicillin or erythromycin, but reliable susceptibility data are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To define WT MIC distributions of 12 antimicrobial agents and provide data for the determination of tentative epidemiological cut-off values (TECOFFs) for potentially toxigenic corynebacteria and to evaluate the potential usefulness of a gradient test (Etest) for susceptibility testing of penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. METHODS: For the 421 human or veterinary isolates from the period 2011-17, MICs of 12 antimicrobial agents were determined. Etest performance was evaluated for penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. RESULTS: MIC distributions were characterized and TECOFFs could be set for 11 out of 24 antibiotic/species combinations. The current EUCAST clinical breakpoints, predominantly determined for Corynebacterium species other than C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans, divide the WT MIC distributions of penicillin and clindamycin, thereby making reproducible susceptibility testing of C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans difficult. For erythromycin, 4% of C. diphtheriae and 2% of C. ulcerans had MICs higher than those for WT isolates. Phenotypically detectable resistance to other antibiotics was rare. Etest underestimated MICs of penicillin and lower concentrations needed to be included for erythromycin, while for clindamycin the Etest was not a good surrogate method. CONCLUSIONS: MIC distributions based on reference broth microdilution for potentially toxigenic Corynebacterium spp. were developed. For five and six agents, TECOFFs were suggested for C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans, respectively, but for Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis the number of isolates was too low.",1460-2091 (Electronic) 0305-7453 (Linking),2020 Oct 1,,"['5880199 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkaa280 [doi]']",['eng'],England,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Nontoxigenic tox-bearing (NTTB) Corynebacterium isolates have been described, but impact of these isolates on the accuracy of molecular diagnostics is not well characterized. Here, we describe a new triplex RT-PCR assay to detect tox and distinguish C. diphtheriae from the closely related species C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis Analytical sensitivity and specificity of the assay were assessed in comparison to culture using 690 previously characterized microbial isolates. The new triplex assay characterized Corynebacterium isolates accurately, with 100% analytical sensitivity for all targets. Analytical specificity with isolates was 94.1%, 100%, and 99.5% for tox, Diph_rpoB, and CUP_rpoB targets, respectively. Twenty-nine NTTB Corynebacterium isolates, representing 5.9% of 494 nontoxigenic isolates tested, were detected by RT-PCR. Whole-genome sequencing of NTTB isolates revealed varied mutations putatively underlying their lack of toxin production, as well as eight isolates with no mutation in tox or the promoter region. This new Corynebacterium RT-PCR method provides a rapid tool to screen isolates and identify probable diphtheria cases directly from specimens.

As a result of the presence of a wide range of clinical manifestations specific to other infectious diseases, the use of laboratory test methods (LTM) is required to make a diagnosis. The presence of Q fever anthropurgic foci in the Novosibirsk region was described in the 90s of the last century, but due attention to its laboratory diagnostics is not paid in this region. The aim of the study was to identify genetic and serological markers of the causative agent, C. burnetii, in patients of the Novosibirsk region who were admitted for treatment with fever with suspected tick-borne infections (TBIs). DNA marker of the causative agent of Q fever was detected in blood samples by real time PCR in 9 out of 325 patients. In three patients, the presence of C. burnetii DNA was confirmed by sequencing of the IS1111 and htpB gene fragments. In ELISA tests, antibodies against the causative agent of coxiellosis were detected in the blood sera of 4 patients with positive results of PCR analysis. Contact with tick was registered in 7 out of 9 patients who had C. burnetii DNA and lacked markers of other TBIs.

In severe infection cases, mortality can range from 10% to 30%. Currently most epidemiological data available are based on outbreak investigations and hospital-based studies from endemic countries. The U.S. soldiers at military bases in these countries are highly vulnerable due to the fact that most of them are immunologically naive to these pathogens. No risk assessment of leptospirosis and rickettsial diseases among U.S. military personnel in Honduras is currently available. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of leptospirosis and rickettsial diseases in U.S. military personnel deployed to Honduras using serological assays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of pre- and post-deployment sera from the most recent 1,000 military personnel stationed in Honduras for at least 6 months between 2000 and 2016 was identified for this study. Serum specimens from these eligible subjects were retrieved. All post-deployment serum specimens were screened at a dilution of 1:100 for the presence of IgG antibodies to Leptospira and Rickettsia pathogens. The pre-deployment sera from those individuals with post-deployment IgG antibodies above cutoff (i.e., seropositive) were tested to determine seroconversion. Seroconversion was defined as conversion of an optical density value from below the cutoff (i.e., negative) in a pre-deployed specimen to above the cutoff (i.e., positive) in a post-deployed specimen at a titer of 100. RESULTS: The seropositive post-deployment specimens for antibodies against Leptospira (causing leptospirosis), Rickettsia typhi (causing murine typhus [MT]), spotted fever group rickettsioses (SFGR, causing SFG Rickettsia), Orientia tsutsugamushi (causing scrub typhus [ST]), and Coxiella burnetii (causing Q fever [QF]) were 11.6%, 11.3%, 6%, 5.6%, and 8.0%, respectively. The seroconverted rate in those assigned to Honduras from 2000 to 2016 was 7.3%, 1.9%, 3.9%, 4.3%, and 2.7% for leptospirosis, MT, SFGR, ST, and QF, respectively. Among the seroconverted specimens, 27 showed seroconversion of at least two antibodies. These seroconverted individuals accounted for 8.8% (3 out of 34) of the personnel who looked for medical attention during their deployment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a leptospirosis seroconversion rate of 7.3%, which is higher than the 0.9% and 3.9% seroconversion in Korea and Japan, respectively. The higher rate of seroconversion indicates potential risk of Leptospira exposure. Additional testing of water samples in the pools and pits around the training sites to locate the infected areas is important to eliminate or reduce future exposure to Leptospira during trainings. The rates of seroconversion for ST, MT, spotted fever Rickettsia, and QF were 4.3%, 1.9%, 3.9%, and 2.7%, respectively, indicating the potential exposure to a variety of rickettsial-related pathogens. Testing of vectors for rickettsial pathogens in the areas could inform effective vector control countermeasures to prevent exposure. Proper precaution and protective measures are needed to better protect military personnel deployed to Honduras.",1930-613X (Electronic) 0026-4075 (Linking),2021 Apr 16,,"['6228307 [pii]', '10.1093/milmed/usab120 [doi]']",['eng'],England,,"['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military', 'Surgeons of the United States 2021.

This study focused on three commercial ELISA tests with the following objectives (1) assess their sensitivity and specificity in sheep, goats and cattle, (2) assess the between- and within-herd seroprevalence distribution in these species, accounting for diagnostic errors, and (3) estimate optimal sample sizes considering sensitivity and specificity at herd level. We comparatively tested 1413 cattle, 1474 goat and 1432 sheep serum samples collected in France. We analyzed the cross-classified test results with a hierarchical zero-inflated beta-binomial latent class model considering each herd as a population and conditional dependence as a fixed effect. Potential biases and coverage probabilities of the model were assessed by simulation. Conditional dependence for truly seropositive animals was high in all species for two of the three ELISA methods. Specificity estimates were high, ranging from 94.8% [92.1; 97.8] to 99.2% [98.5; 99.7], whereas sensitivity estimates were generally low, ranging from 39.3 [30.7; 47.0] to 90.5% [83.3; 93.8]. Between- and within-herd seroprevalence estimates varied greatly among geographic areas and herds. Overall, goats showed higher within-herd seroprevalence levels than sheep and cattle. The optimal sample size maximizing both herd sensitivity and herd specificity varied from 3 to at least 20 animals depending on the test and ruminant species. This study provides better interpretation of three widely used commercial ELISA tests and will make it possible to optimize their implementation in future studies. The methodology developed may likewise be applied to other human or animal diseases.",1297-9716 (Electronic) 0928-4249 (Linking),2021 Apr 14,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6463-3796'],"['10.1186/s13567-021-00926-w [doi]', '10.1186/s13567-021-00926-w [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Bayesian', 'Cattle', 'Conditional dependence', 'Diagnostic accuracy', 'Goats', 'Herd sensitivity', 'Latent class model', 'Q fever', 'Sheep']",,,

C. burnetii has become one of the most important causes of abortion in livestock, which can lead to widespread abortions in these animals. There are very limited studies on the prevalence of C. burnetii infection in cases of animal abortion in Iran. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of C. burnetii in ruminant abortion samples in Iran. METHODS: Abortion samples from cattle, sheep and goats were collected from different parts of Iran and were tested using Real-time PCR targeting the IS1111 element of C. burnetii. RESULTS: In this study, 36 samples (24.7%) of the 146 collected samples were positive for C. burnetii. The prevalence of C. burnetii was 21.3% (20 of 94 samples) in sheep samples. Also, 10 of 46 cattle samples (21.7%) were positive. All six goat abortion samples were positive for C. burnetii. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study demonstrate that C. burnetii plays an important role in domestic ruminant abortions in Iran, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the role of C. burnetii in domestic animal abortions by veterinary organizations.

This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of C. burnetii in different animals and to assess the potential role of these species as reservoirs of infection and transmission to humans. A total of 592 blood samples (105 beef cattle, 61 dairy cattle, 110 Korean native goats, 83 Boer goats, and 233 horses) were collected in the Republic of Korea (ROK). The C. burnetii DNA was detected from blood samples using the transposon-like repetitive region (IS1111) by PCR method. The results showed that 22.7% of the Korean-native goats, 16.4% of the dairy cattle, 15.2% of the beef cattle, 6.0% of the Boer goats, and 5.2% of the horses were positive for C. burnetii. Significant differences were found between the animal species. The univariable binary logistic regression analysis revealed that the risk of contracting C. burnetii was significantly high by 5.4-fold in Korean-native goats (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.60%-11.27%, p = 0.000), 3.6-fold in dairy cattle (95% CI: 1.48%-8.82%, p = 0.005), and 3.3-fold in beef cattle (95% CI: 1.51%-7.28%, p = 0.003) compared with horses.

Ehrlichia translocated factor-1 (Etf-1), a type IV secretion system (T4SS) effector, is a primary virulence factor for an obligatory intracellular bacterium, Ehrlichia chaffeensis In this study, we developed Etf-1-specific nanobodies (Nbs) by immunizing a llama to determine if intracellular Nbs block Etf-1 functions and Ehrlichia infection. Of 24 distinct anti-Etf-1 Nbs, NbD7 blocked mitochondrial localization of Etf-1-GFP in cotransfected cells. NbD7 and control Nb (NbD3) bound to different regions of Etf-1. Size-exclusion chromatography showed that the NbD7 and Etf-1 complex was more stable than the NbD3 and Etf-1 complex. Intracellular expression of NbD7 inhibited three activities of Etf-1 and E. chaffeensis: up-regulation of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase, reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and inhibition of cellular apoptosis. Consequently, intracellular NbD7 inhibited Ehrlichia infection, whereas NbD3 did not. To safely and effectively deliver Nbs into the host cell cytoplasm, NbD7 was conjugated to cyclized cell-permeable peptide 12 (CPP12-NbD7). CPP12-NbD7 effectively entered mammalian cells and abrogated the blockade of cellular apoptosis caused by E. chaffeensis and inhibited infection by E. chaffeensis in cell culture and in a severe combined-immunodeficiency mouse model.

We recently reported that E. chaffeensis activates canonical Wnt signaling in monocytes to promote bacterial uptake and intracellular survival and that TRP120 was involved in this activation event. To identify the specific mechanism of pathway activation, we hypothesized that TRP120 is a Wnt signaling ligand mimetic that initiates Wnt pathway activity through direct interaction with the Wnt pathway Frizzled family of receptors. In this study, we used confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to demonstrate very strong colocalization between E. chaffeensis and Fzd2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 as well as coreceptor LRP5 at 1 to 3 h postinfection. Direct binding between TRP120 and multiple Fzd receptors was further confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Interfering RNA knockdown of Wnt receptors, coreceptors, and signaling pathway components significantly reduced E. chaffeensis infection, demonstrating that complex and redundant interactions are involved in Wnt pathway exploitation. We utilized in silico approaches to identify a repetitive short linear motif (SLiM) in TRP120 that is homologous to Wnt ligands and used mutant SLiM peptides and an alpha-TRP120-Wnt-SLiM antibody to demonstrate that the TRP120 Wnt SLiM activates the canonical Wnt pathway and promotes E. chaffeensis infection. This study reports the first example of bacterial mimicry of Wnt pathway ligands and highlights a pathogenic mechanism with potential for targeting by antimicrobial therapeutics.IMPORTANCE Upon infecting mammalian hosts, Ehrlichia chaffeensis establishes a replicative niche in microbe-eating immune system cells where it expertly orchestrates infection and spread. One of the ways Ehrlichia survives within these phagocytes is by activating evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways including the Wnt pathway; however, the molecular details of pathway hijacking have not been defined. This study is significant because it identifies an ehrlichial protein that directly interacts with components of the Wnt receptor complex, influencing pathway activity and promoting infection. Consequentially, Ehrlichia serves as a unique tool to investigate the intricacies of how pathogens repurpose human immune cell signaling and provides an opportunity to better understand many cellular processes in health and disease. Furthermore, understanding how this bacterium utilizes its small genome to survive within cells that evolved to destroy pathogens will facilitate the development of antibacterial therapeutics that could target Ehrlichia as well as other intracellular agents of human disease.",2379-5042 (Electronic) 2379-5042 (Linking),2021 Apr 21,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4360-3429', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2213-9551', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3335-1539']","['6/2/e00216-21 [pii]', '10.1128/mSphere.00216-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['Ehrlichia chaffeensis', 'SLiM', 'TRP120', 'Wnt ligand', 'tandem repeat']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Rogan et al.'],,

In this study, we describe the characterization of a cluster of seven genes spanning from ECH_0659 to ECH_0665, which contained four genes encoding bacterial phage proteins, including the ECH_0660 gene. Assessment of the promoter region upstream to the first gene of the seven genes (ECH_0659) in Escherichia coli demonstrated transcriptional enhancement under zinc and iron starvation. Further, transcription of the seven genes was significantly higher for E. chaffeensis having a mutation in the ECH_0660 gene compared to the wild-type pathogen under zinc and iron starving conditions. In contrast, transcription from the genes was mostly similar to wild-type or moderately downregulated for the ECH_0665 gene mutant with the function disruption. Recently, we reported that this mutation caused a minimal impact on the pathogen's in vivo growth, as it persisted similar to wild-type. The current study is the first in describing how zinc and iron contribute to E. chaffeensis biology.

For each pathogen, risk factors (i.e. geographical area, keeping condition, sex, age, breed, tick infestation, weekly sanitation of dog enclosures and application of ectoparasiticides) were evaluated by logistic regression approach. RESULTS: In total, 18.2% (n = 91, 95% CI 15.1-21.8) of dogs scored seropositive for at least one pathogen, the most frequent being Ehrlichia spp. (n = 56; 11.2%; 95% CI 8.7-14.3) followed by Anaplasma spp. (n = 33; 6.6%, 95% CI 4.7-9.1), Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.)

The life cycle of E. chaffeensis includes ticks and mammals, in which E. chaffeensis proteins are expressed differentially contributing to bacterial survival and infection. Among the E. chaffeensis P28-OMP outer membrane proteins, OMP-1B and P28 are predominantly expressed in tick cells and mammalian macrophages, respectively. The mechanisms regulating this differential expression have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we demonstrate that the transcriptional regulators EcxR and Tr1 regulate the differential expression of omp-1B and p28 in E. chaffeensis. Recombinant E. chaffeensis Tr1 bound to the promoters of omp-1B and p28, and transactivated omp-1B and p28 promoter-EGFP fusion constructs in Escherichia coli. The consensus sequence of Tr1 binding motifs was A(C)/TTATA as determined with DNase I footprint assay. Tr1 showed a higher affinity towards the p28 promoter than the omp-1B promoter as determined with surface plasmon resonance. EcxR activated the tr1 expression in response to a temperature decrease. At 37 degrees C low level of Tr1 activated the p28 expression. At 25 degrees C high level of Tr1 activated the omp-1B expression, while repressing the p28 expression by binding to an additional site upstream of the p28 gene. Our data provide insights into a novel mechanism mediated by Tr1 regulating E. chaffeensis differential gene expression, which may aid in the development of new therapeutics for HME.",2222-1751 (Electronic) 2222-1751 (Linking),2021 Dec,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1870-5338'],['10.1080/22221751.2021.1899054 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['Ehrlichia chaffeensis', 'P28-OMP outer membrane proteins', 'Tr1', 'differential gene expression', 'human monocytic ehrlichiosis']",,,

The most frequently identified cases of ehrlichiosis come from the southeastern and south central states of the United States. In this study, a molecular typing system was developed that allows for the genetic differentiation of E. chaffeensis isolates. This multi-locus typing system included sequencing and analyzing intergenic regions ECH0033-ECH0035 and ECH0217-ECH0218, plus, variable genes variable length PCR target, 28-kDa, 120-kDa, and hemE. We examined a total of 31 unique isolates from humans and white-tailed deer, and eight DNA samples extracted from infected A. americanum collected from multiple states. This is the largest evaluation of E. chaffeensis isolates and their genotypes. Our findings show that when sequences of all six loci were concatenated and compared, the 39 samples could be separated into 23 genotypes and further grouped into six phylogenetic clades. The data in this study show no clear pattern between the geographic alignment with the genetic differentiation between the strains. As a result, this poses a challenge to understanding the spread of E. chaffeensis in the United States. Interestingly, our findings indicate that multiple strains from distant geographic origins share the same mutations, which suggests that the strains are being moved from one site to another by their hosts or vectors. In addition, we are seeing a northward shift in the lone star tick distribution in the United States.

The hill tribe people is defined as vulnerable population for antibiotic resistance in Thailand due to poor economic and education status particularly the Lahu people who is the second greatest group of the hill tribe people in Thailand. The study aimed to estimate the prevalence, factors associated with, and typing major species of bacteria with antibiotic drugs resistance among the Lahu hill tribe people in northern Thailand. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to gather the information from the participants. A validated questionnaire was used for data collection. Participants who presented an illness related to infectious diseases were eligible to participate the study and were asked to obtain specific specimen; sputum, urine or stool. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by Kirbey Bauer's disc diffusion test. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to detect the associations between variables at the significant level of alpha = 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 240 participants were recruited into the study. The majority had urinary tract infection (67.9%) with two major pathogenic species of the infection; Escherichia coli (12.8%), and Enterobacter cloacae (8.0%). The prevalence of antibiotic resistance was 16.0%. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae species were found to have multidrug resistance that was greater than that of other species, while ampicillin was found to have the greatest drug resistance. It was found that those who had poor knowledge of antibiotic use had a 2.56-fold greater chance (95% CI = 1.09-5.32) of having antibiotic resistance than did those who had good knowledge of antibiotic use, and those who had poor antibiotic use behaviors had a 1.79-fold greater chance (95% CI = 1.06-4.80) of having antibiotic resistance than did those who had good antibiotic use behaviors.

As a natural example of active matter, swarming is also an essential biological phenotype associated with virulence, chemotaxis, and host pathogenesis. Physical changes like cell elongation and hyper flagellation have been shown to accompany the swarming phenotype. Less studied, however, are the contrasts of collective motion between the swarming cells and their counterpart planktonic cells of comparable cell density. Here, we show that confining bacterial movement in circular microwells allows distinguishing bacterial swarming from collective swimming. On a soft agar plate, a novel bacterial strain Enterobacter sp. SM3 in swarming and planktonic states exhibited different motion patterns when confined to circular microwells of a specific range of sizes. When the confinement diameter was between 40 mum and 90 mum, swarming SM3 formed a single swirl motion pattern in the microwells whereas planktonic SM3 formed multiple swirls. Similar differential behavior is observed across several other species of gram-negative bacteria. We also observed 'rafting behavior' of swarming bacteria upon dilution. We hypothesize that the rafting behavior might account for the motion pattern difference. We were able to predict these experimental features via numerical simulations where swarming cells are modeled with stronger cell-cell alignment interaction.

Multidrug-resistant E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the 48 bottled water. Treat assessment test revealed that 88.23% of the isolated E. coli produced beta hemolytic colonies, while 11.77% did not show hemolytic colonies, 100% E. aerogenes colonies were not able to develop hemolytic colonies and 100%, P. aeruginosa colonies gave beta hemolytic colonies, respectively. Chi-square test shows that there is a significant association (p </= .05) between fecal coliform and volume of the vessel (i.e., 20 and 1 L), bottle type (i.e., unscratched and undented and scratched and/or dented), season (i.e., monsoon and postmonsoon), and total coliform. Chi-square test shows that there is no significant (p > .05) association between Pseudomonas spp and season (i.e., monsoon and postmonsoon). Out of 100 samples, 48% of samples were found to be contaminated with total coliform. Microorganisms survive in bottled water as they have many nutrients required for the microorganism in ionic form.

However, most of the soils are P-deficient and the extensive use of P- chemical fertilizers constitute a serious threat to the environment. In this context, two field experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of co-inoculation of Mesorhizobium ciceri with phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB), Bacillus sp., and Enterobacter aerogenes, on chickpea as an alternative to chemical nitrogen (N) and phosphorous fertilizers in P-deficient soils in dry areas of Morocco. The results revealed that combined inoculation of chickpea with rhizobia and PSB showed a significant enhancement of chickpea nodulation, biomass production, yields and N, P, and protein content in grains as compared to single inoculation or single application of N or P. A significantly higher increase was obtained by inoculating chickpea with Mesorhizobium sp. MA72 combined with E. aerogenes P1S6. This combination allowed an enhancement of more than 270% in nodulation, 192% in shoot dry weight and 242% in grain yield. The effect of this combination was equivalent to the effect of combined application of N and P fertilizers.

Bacterial siderophores are small molecules with unmatched capacity to scavenge iron from proteins and the extracellular milieu, where it mostly occurs as insoluble Fe(3+). Siderophores chelate Fe(3+) for uptake into the cell, where it is reduced to soluble Fe(2+). Siderophores are key molecules in low soluble iron conditions. The ability of bacteria to synthesize proprietary siderophores may have increased bacterial evolutionary fitness; one way that bacteria diversify siderophore structure is by incorporating different polyamine backbones while maintaining the catechol moieties. RESULTS: We report that Serratia plymuthica V4 produces a variety of siderophores, which we term the siderome, and which are assembled by the concerted action of enzymes encoded in two independent gene clusters. Besides assembling serratiochelin A and B with diaminopropane, S. plymuthica utilizes putrescine and the same set of enzymes to assemble photobactin, a siderophore found in the bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens. The enzymes encoded by one of the gene clusters can independently assemble enterobactin. A third, independent operon is responsible for biosynthesis of the hydroxamate siderophore aerobactin, initially described in Enterobacter aerogenes. Mutant strains not synthesizing polyamine-siderophores significantly increased enterobactin production levels, though lack of enterobactin did not impact the production of serratiochelins. Knocking out SchF0, an enzyme involved in the assembly of enterobactin alone, significantly reduced bacterial fitness. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the natural occurrence of serratiochelins, photobactin, enterobactin, and aerobactin in a single bacterial species and illuminates the interplay between siderophore biosynthetic pathways and polyamine production, indicating routes of molecular diversification. Given its natural yields of diaminopropane (97.75 mumol/g DW) and putrescine (30.83 mumol/g DW), S. plymuthica can be exploited for the industrial production of these compounds.",1741-7007 (Electronic) 1741-7007 (Linking),2021 Mar 15,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3918-8923'],"['10.1186/s12915-021-00971-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12915-021-00971-z [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Natural products', 'Pathway elucidation', 'Polyamines', 'Siderophores']",,,

Partially purified beta-galactosidase was immobilized by entrapment method in agar-agar gel matrix. Agar-agar entrapped beads were prepared by dropping the enzyme-agar solution to ice-cooled toluene-chloroform ((3:1 (v/v)). 45.88+/-0.11% activity of partially purified beta-galactosidase was retained after immobilization (bead shape). Maximum immobilization yield was observed in the presence of 2.5% agar-agar concentration. After immobilization, optimum temperature required for the enzyme-substrate reaction was shifted from 50 to 60 degrees C and the optimum reaction time was shifted from 15 to 25 min. The optimum pH for both free and immobilized beta-galactosidase was pH 7. Free enzyme showed lower activation energy in comparison with the immobilized one. For free as well as immobilized beta-galactosidase thermal deactivation, rate constant (kd) increased with increasing temperature while the values of decimal reduction time (D-values) and half-lives (t1/2) decreased. Immobilization process increased the t1/2 and D-values of beta-galactosidase while it decreased the kd. Thermostability of immobilized beta-galactosidase was higher as they showed higher enthalpy (DeltaEta(0)) and Gibb's free energy (DeltaG(0))value than those of the free beta-galactosidase. The negative entropy (DeltaS(0)) of free and immobilized beta-galactosidase established that both were in a more ordered state within the temperature range (50 to 70 degrees C) studied.

This study was designed to determine the epidemiological characteristics of plasmid mediated colistin resistance and carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae from tertiary A hospital located in Hefei, China. Methods: Totally, 158 carbapenems resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were screened for antibiotic susceptibility, mcr-1, extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), and fosfomycin resistance genes using PCR and sequencing. The sequence types were identified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Plasmid profiles were determined by PCR based replicon typing (PBRT), and the plasmid sizes were confirmed by southern blotting. Results: The isolates showed high MIC50 and MIC90 for all antimicrobials, except tigecycline, meropenem, and colistin. The main Carbapenemase genes were bla KPC-2 (90.5%), bla NDM-1(3.7%), bla OXA-48(5.6%) and fosA3 (14.5%). The bla CTXM-15 found 36.7%, mcr-1 (3.7%) recorded in six isolates.

Among E. coli isolates, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX were detected in 20.8%, 4.53%, and 85.7% isolates, respectively. For both species, the most frequent genotype was blaCTX-M-15. Among Enterobacteriaceae, the most frequently detected carbapenemase-encoding gene was blaNDM-1 (81.5%), followed by blaOXA-232 (14.8%) and blaoxa-181(7.4%), in A. baumannii was blaOXA-24 (76%) and in P. aeruginosa, was blaIMP (25.3%), followed by blaGES and blaVIM (13.1% each). CONCLUSION: Our study reports that NDM-1 is the most frequent carbapenemase-encoding gene in Mexico in Enterobacteriaceae with the circulation of the oxacillinase genes 181 and 232. KPC, in contrast to other countries in Latin America and the USA, is a rare occurrence. Additionally, a high circulation of ESBL blaCTX-M-15 exists in both E. coli and K. pneumoniae.",1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),2021,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6580-2990', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7387-0937', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1259-7425', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9576-1950', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2720-8971', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8044-0094']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0248614 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-35071 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

In addition, data regarding antimicrobial use (AMU), farm hygiene, and farm management were collected in order to identify possible risks for ESBL occurrence. Ten farms participated in the study with a median of 781 milking cows (319-1701). All calves investigated were younger than two weeks with an average age of 6.8 (+/-3.9) days. The farms were visited and samples were collected twice at an interval of 7-11 months. Faecal samples diluted 1:10, were plated onto BrillianceTM ESBL agar in duplicates. After 24 hours at 37 degrees C, colonies were counted and total colony forming units (cfu)/ml calculated. Bacteria species were identified biochemically. ESBL-production was phenotypically confirmed using the MICRONAUT-S beta-Lactamases system. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using VITEK(R) 2 technology. Phylotyping of E. coli isolates and screening for bla genes was performed by PCR. ESBL-producing enterobacteria were detected on all farms and 96.5% of calves investigated shed ESBL-positive bacteria. Of all ESBL-producing isolates, the majority were E. coli (92.9%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (2.0%). The majority of E. coli isolates was clearly assigned to phylogroup C (25.0%), followed by phylogroups A (15.2%) and E (14.1%). CTX-M group 1 was most frequently detected (80.4%). E. cloacae contained blaCTX-M and blaTEM or blaSHV. K. pneumoniae harboured blaSHV only. Besides resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins, the majority of isolates was also resistant to one or more antibiotic classes, with a high proportion being resistant against fluoroqinolones. 52.5% of isolates were further characterised as threefold multidrug resistant gram-negative bacteria (3MDR-GNB) according to the German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention. None of the isolates were 4MDR-GNB, i.e. none revealed carbapenem-resistance. Penicillins were the most frequently administered antibiotics to calves on most farms and were the predominant substance class at herd level on all farms. Overall, the number of calves treated prior to sampling was rather low (11.7%). Analyses of data regarding the farm management identified weaknesses in biosecurity and cleaning and disinfection. Besides beta-lactam antibiotics being the most commonly used antibiotics no other risk factors could be identified. In summary, the prevalence of ESBL-carriers in dairy calves was exceptionally high and should be motivation to develop strategies for the reduction of multidrug-resistant bacteria in farm animals.",1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),2021,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1275-9586'],"['10.1371/journal.pone.0248291 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-33463 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

In the DRC, neonatal sepsis causes 15.6% of this mortality, but data on the bacterial etiology and associated drug susceptibility are lacking. METHODS: Hemocultures of 150 neonates with possible early onset neonatal sepsis (pEOS) were obtained at the Hopital Provincial General de Reference de Bukavu (HPGRB, Bukavu, DRC). The newborns with pEOS received an empirical first-line antimicrobial treatment (ampicillin, cefotaxime and gentamicin), based on the synopsis of international guidelines for the management of EOS which are in line with WHO recommendations. Isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrophotometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Antibiotic resistance was assessed using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: A total of 50 strains was obtained from 48 patients and identified. The three most prevalent species were Enterobacter cloacae complex (42%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%) and Serratia marcescens (12%). Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to all first-line antibiotics. All K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens isolates were resistant to ampicillin, and the majority of the K. pneumoniae and half of the S. marcescens isolates were resistant to both cefotaxime and gentamicin. All E. cloacae complex strains, 89% of the K. pneumoniae and half of S. marcescens had an extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype.

Taniborbactam (VNRX-5133) is a newly developed beta-lactamase inhibitor with a wide spectrum of activity covering both serine and metallo enzymes. We therefore evaluated cefepime-taniborbactam activity against ESBL-producing isolates and determined the concentrations to be used in MIC determinations in the clinical laboratory. The in vitro activity of cefepime (0.06 to 256 mg liter(-1)) combined with taniborbactam (0.03 to 32 mg liter(-1)) against 129 clinically and molecularly well-documented ESBL-producing isolates (42 Escherichia coli, 39 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 28 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 Citrobacter freundii, and 2 Enterobacter aerogenes) was tested with a broth microdilution checkerboard method based on the ISO standard. The MICs of cefepime alone and in combination, together with percentage resistance at different concentrations of taniborbactam, were calculated for each species and resistance mechanism. The median (range)/MIC90 of cefepime was 32 (0.125 to 256)/256 mg liter(-1) for all Enterobacterales isolates (n = 101), with 72% being resistant, and 32 (8 to 256)/128 mg liter(-1) for the 28 P. aeruginosa isolates, with 86% being resistant. The median (range)/90th percentile concentration of taniborbactam required to restore Enterobacterales susceptibility to cefepime (MIC </=1 mg liter(-1)) was 0.06 (</=0.03 to 32)/4 mg liter(-1) and P. aeruginosa susceptibility to increased exposure to cefepime (MIC </=8 mg liter(-1)) 1 (</=0.032 to 32)/32 mg liter(-1) At a fixed concentration of 4 mg liter(-1) of taniborbactam, cefepime median (range)/MIC90 were reduced to 0.125 (0.06 to 4)/1 mg liter(-1) for Enterobacterales with no resistant isolates found, and to 8 (2 to 64)/16 mg liter(-1) for P. aeruginosa isolates, where 36% remained resistant.

The presence of both extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- (ESBL) and carbapenemase-encoding genes has notably been reported in wild birds, that can act as sentinels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) contamination but also as long-distance spreaders in case of migratory birds. Here, 424 wild birds brought to a rescue center in France were sampled over a 6-month period. These birds encompassed 62 different sedentary or migratory species. A further 16 wild mammals present in the center were also investigated. No carbapenemase-producer was found, but we identified a surprisingly high proportion (24.1%) of ESBL-positive isolates. A total of 144 non-duplicate isolates were collected, including Escherichia coli (n = 88), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 51), and Citrobacter freundii (n = 5), of which 123 carried the bla CTX-M- 9 gene. PFGE, phylogroup, and MLST revealed the presence of a limited number of ESBL-positive clones circulating in these animals, all presenting multiple associated resistances. Next-generation sequencing on a subset of isolates, followed by Southern blot hybridization, showed the wide dissemination of an IncHI2/ST1 plasmid carrying the bla CTX-M- 9, bla SHV- 12 and mcr-9 genes. In all, our results undoubtedly reflect cross transmissions of ESC-resistance (ESC-R) Enterobacteriaceae within the rescue center - similarly to nosocomial spreads observed at hospital, rather than the true bacterial flora of birds. We also showed that the spread of ESC-R in this rescue center did not only rely on clonal but also on a highly successful plasmidic transmission.

Transcription of all four genes associated with the biosynthesis and immunity of enterocin P and enterocin TW21 were confirmed by RT-PCR. However, Sanger sequencing confirmed a truncation of the structural gene of enterocin TW21 due to one base pair deletion (A/T). Thus, although E. faecium E86 was shown to carry two bacteriocinogenic gene clusters, only one cluster encodes a functional bacteriocin, enterocin P.

While treating sepsis, bacterial clearance must be achieved to ensure patient survival, and the hepatic immune response is responsible for this process. In particular, Kupffer cells play a crucial role in the hepatic immune response against infectious agents. Recently, two populations of Kupffer cells have been described: liver-resident macrophages (Mvarphi) (F4/80(+) CD11b(-) CD68(+) cells) and hepatic Mvarphi derived from circulating monocytes (F4/80(+) CD11b(+) CD68(-) cells). We examined the properties of both types of hepatic Mvarphi obtained from irradiated and normal mice and their role in sepsis. Hepatic F4/80(+) CD11b(-) CD68(+) cells from both normal and irradiated mice did not show any antibacterial activity. However, F4/80(+) CD11b(+) CD68(-) cells from normal mice behaved as effector cells against sepsis by Enterococcus faecalis, although those from irradiated mice lost this ability. Moreover, hepatic F4/80(+) CD11b(+) CD68(-) cells from normal infected mice were shown to be IL-12(+) IL-10(-) CD206(-) CCL1(-) (considered M1Mvarphi), and hepatic F4/80(+) CD11b(-) CD68(+) cells from the same mice were shown to be IL-12(-) IL-10(+) CD206(+) CCL1(-) (considered M2aMvarphi). When normal mice were exposed to radiation, hepatic F4/80(+) CD11b(+) CD68(-) cells altered their phenotype to IL-12(-) IL-10(+) CD206(-) CCL1(+) (considered M2bMvarphi), independent of infection, but hepatic F4/80(+) CD11b(-) CD68(+) cells remained IL-12(-) IL-10(+) CD206(+) CCL1(-) (M2aMvarphi). In addition, hepatic F4/80(+) CD11b(+) CD68(-) cells from irradiated mice acquired antibacterial activity upon treatment with CCL1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Therefore, the characteristics of hepatic F4/80(+) CD11b(+) CD68(-) cells play a key role in the antibacterial response against gut-associated sepsis.",1938-3673 (Electronic) 0741-5400 (Linking),2021 May,,['10.1002/JLB.4A0820-550RR [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['monocytes/macrophage', 'radiation', 'rodent', 'sepsis']",['(c)2021 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],,

Changes in the gut microbiota are closely related to the occurrence and development of human diseases, but few studies have focused on taxonomic composition of gut microbiota in septic patients. Knowledge of changes in the gut microbiota is a key issue in intensive care. Clinicians must understand how an altered gut microbiota affects the susceptibility and prognosis of septic patients. Measurements and Main Results: In the single-center case control study, 20 septic patients and 20 healthy children were recruited. The taxonomic composition of gut microbiota was determined via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Gut microbiota diversity in children with sepsis was significantly reduced compared with that in healthy children. The taxonomic composition of gut microbiota can effectively distinguish children with sepsis from healthy children. Thirteen taxa of gut microbiota were significantly increased in the guts of children with sepsis compared with those of healthy children. The increased abundances of Enterococcaceae, Enterococcus, and Enterococcus durans in gut of septic patients were significantly positively correlated with blood inflammation indicators CRP and WBC. The abundances of seven bacteria were significantly decreased in the guts of septic children compared with those of healthy children. The decreased abundance of Bifidobacteriales in gut of septic patients is significantly negatively correlated with blood inflammation index WBC. A machine-learning classifier was built for distinguishing sepsis and achieved the AUC value of 81.25%. It shows that the composition of gut microbiota has certain potential for diagnosis of sepsis. Conclusions: Gut microbiota alterations in septic patients exhibit proliferation of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, the massive reduction of the commensal flora, and the significant decrease in the diversity of the gut microbiota. Dysbiosis may also account for some changes in the inflammation indexes.",2296-2360 (Print) 2296-2360 (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fped.2021.645060 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['16S rRNA gene', 'Enterococcus', 'gut microbiota', 'sepsis', 'short-chain fatty acids']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Wang, Chen, Ma, Peng, Zhang, Wang, Yan and Lu.']",,

In addition, in the face of the global issue of antimicrobial resistance, the isolated bacterial strains were evaluated for their antibiotic susceptibility profile. The pathogenic bacterial community was predominantly of Gram-negative strains (66.66%). The most common species were Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus sp., Raoutella sp., Klebsiella ozaenae and Pseudomonas sp. However, except for the healthy control group, Staphylococcus spp. was isolated from all stages of periodontitis. Multidrug resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was observed for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Raoutella sp. and Enterococcus avium. Here, we verify a statistically significant relationship between periodontitis stages and the diversity of the bacterial community. Patients with periodontitis showed a more diverse and numerous bacterial community compared to healthy patients. In this sense, we reinforce that biofilms that harbour multidrug-resistant bacteria are a major concern in relation to restoring patient health.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have become an important cause of nosocomial infection. In this study, we analyzed the incidence, antibiotic resistance, and outcomes of enterococcal bacteremia in living donor liver transplant recipients and the risk factors for VRE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-center, retrospective review included 536 patients who underwent liver transplant between January 2008 and December 2017. RESULTS: Among 536 patients, 42 (7.8%) experienced a total of 58 enterococcal bacteremic episodes (37 Enterococcus faecium, 17 Enterococcus faecalis, 2 Enterococcus casseliflavus, 1 Enterococcus. avium, and 1 Enterococcus raffinosus). Most cases of enterococcal bacteremia (46/58, 79.3%) occurred within 6 months after transplant; among the 26 cases of VRE bacteremia, 50% occurred within 1 month after transplant. E. faecium isolates had the highest rate of vancomycin resistance (25/37, 67.5%), whereas all E. faecalis isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. According to multivariate analysis, post-transplant dialysis (odds ratio, 3.95; 95% CI, 1.51-10.34; P = .005) and length of post-transplant hospital stay (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.009-1.04; P = .004) were significantly associated with VRE bacteremia.

Usage of antibiotics in food production and in human or veterinary medicine has resulted in the emergence of commensal antibiotic resistant bacteria in the human gut. The incidence of erythromycin-resistant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the feces of healthy vegans, ovo-lacto vegetarians and omnivores was analyzed. Overall, 155 LAB were isolated and characterized for their phenotypic and genotypic resistance to erythromycin. The isolates belonged to 11 different species within the Enterococcus and Streptococcus genera. Enterococcus faecium was the dominant species in isolates from all the dietary categories. Only 97 out of 155 isolates were resistant to erythromycin after Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) determination; among them, 19 isolates (7 from vegans, 4 from ovo-lacto vegetarians and 8 from omnivores) carried the erm(B) gene. The copresence of erm(B) and erm(A) genes was only observed in Enterococcus avium from omnivores. Moreover, the transferability of erythromycin resistance genes using multidrug-resistant (MDR) cultures selected from the three groups was assessed, and four out of six isolates were able to transfer the erm(B) gene. Overall, isolates obtained from the omnivore samples showed resistance to a greater number of antibiotics and carried more tested antibiotic resistance genes compared to the isolates from ovo-lacto vegetarians and vegans.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifteen faecal samples were collected from wild and laboratory rabbits. One hundred and eight isolates were collected and tested for their inhibitory power against eight pathogenic bacteria. Among them, 43 Enterococcus isolates were able to inhibit at least one pathogen. Enterocine genes entA, entB and entP were detected in 14, 17 and 22 isolates, respectively. These isolates were tested for their antibiotic susceptibility and genes encoding virulence factors. Relevant phenotypes of antibiotic resistance were observed especially for ampicillin, vancomycin and linezolid. The following virulence genes were detected (number of positive isolates): hyl (5), esp (8), gelE (30), agg (2), ace (21), efa (6), CylLL/s (5), cob (26), cpd (32) and ccf (33).

Here we report the isolation and characterization of pathogenic Vibrio spp. and lactic acid bacteria from an intensive culture system of Litopenaeus vannamei and natural ecosystem, respectively. The pathogen isolated from the gut of L. vannamei showing the symptoms of white gut disease were identified as V. parahaemolyticus and V. campbelli. Both the pathogens expressed the virulence genes, rtxA, and tcpA and were showing multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of more than 0.5. The lactic acid bacteria isolated from the sediment and gut of benthic organisms (shrimp and polychaetes) collected from a tropical estuary were classified as member of 9 OTUs such as Pediococcus stilessi, Lactobacillus fermentum, L. rhamnosus, Weissella cibaria, Enterococcus durans, E. fecalis, Streptococcus gallolyticus and L. garvieae. Majority of these isolates were facultative in nature and were able to tolerate gastric juice and bile salt. Out of 83 bacteria isolated from sediment and gut, 36 showed abilities to reduce the pH of culture medium to less than five. Many of these isolates (34 Nos.) showed production of hydrolytic enzymes and secondary metabolites with antagonistic activity against both the pathogens (1 No.) or separately toward V. parahaemolyticus (9 Nos.) and V. campbelli (11 Nos.). Overall, the current study proposes a natural ecosystem as a potential source of lactic acid bacteria with probiotic potentials to prevent the vibriosis disease outbreaks in shrimp aquaculture systems.

The comparative genomic analysis revealed that the strain is distantly related to potentially pathogenic Enterococcus spp. The genome was devoid of genes encoding acquired antibiotic resistance or marker virulence factors associated with Enterococcus spp. Phenotypically, the bacterium is susceptible to vancomycin, ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and aminoglycosides and does not have any hemolytic or gelatinase activity, or cytotoxic effect on Caco-2 cells. Altogether, these findings confirm the lack of hazardous traits in E. durans OSY-EGY. Mining E. durans OSY-EGY genome, for probiotic-related sequences, revealed genes associated with acid and bile salts tolerance, adhesion, competitiveness, antioxidant activitiy, antimicrobial activity, essential amino acids production, and vitamins biosynthesis. Phenotypically, E. durans OSY-EGY was tolerant to acidic pH (3.0), and presence of 0.3% bile salts. The bacterium showed adhesion capability to Caco-2 cells, cholesterol-lowering effect, DPPH scavenging activity, and antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria.

Their resistance to antibiotics such as vancomycin has led to life-threatening and difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections. The true prevalence in clinical settings in Nigeria is not well known due to the lack of a comprehensive antibiotic surveillance system.

Methods: Databases (PubMed, African Journal Online, and Google scholar) were searched following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 statements for articles reporting VRE prevalence, and were published before August 5, 2020. Data from the studies were extracted and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA 3.0), respectively. The pooled prevalence of VRE was estimated with the random-effects model and the 95% confidence interval (CI). The heterogeneity level was assessed using Cochran Q and I (2) tests. Results: A total of 35 articles were scanned for eligibility, among which 7 were included in the study after fulfilling the eligibility criteria.

The protein is involved in stress response via the RIP pathway which is crucial for pathogenic enterococci to evade host immune attacks during infection. Eep serves also as a receptor for the bacteriocins enterocin K1 and enterocin EJ97. The bacteriocins kill Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, respectively, and their antibiotic resistant derivatives including vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). This functional duality of Eep makes these two enterocins very promising as options in the prospective treatment of enterococcal infections because wildtype enterococcal cells (with an intact Eep) are sensitive to the bacteriocins while bacteriocin-resistant-mutants (without a functional Eep) become less virulent. As a first step to explore their therapeutic potential in the treatment of systemic enterococcal infections, we investigated the compatibility of the bacteriocins with human blood, and the phenotypic changes of eep-mutants toward different stress conditions. We found that the bacteriocins were compatible with blood, as they did not cause haemolysis and that the bacteriocins retained most of their antibacterial effect when incubated in blood. The bacteriocins were autoclavable which is a crucial criterium for the development of parenteral administration. Eep-mutants, which became resistant to the bacteriocin were, as expected, less capable to withstand stress conditions such as exposure to lysozyme and desiccation. Further, their ability to chain, a trait implicated in niche adaptation as well as being necessary for genetic transfer via conjugation, was also severely affected. Together, these results indicate that the bacteriocins are promising for treatment of VRE infection.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fmicb.2021.649339 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Eep', 'EntEJ97', 'EntK1', 'VRE infection', 'bacteriocin', 'enterococci']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Reinseth, Tonnesen, Carlsen and Diep.']",,

There is a paucity of data on VRE in many countries of Asia as well as limited pooled estimates. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate a pooled prevalence of VRE in Asia. METHODS: A literature search in electronic databases like PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar and manual searching of references and grey literature, comprising the information on the prevalence of VRE with at least two species of enterococci, conducted in different countries of Asia from January 1, 2000, to September 20, 2020, was done. The random-effect model and 95% CIs was used to calculate the pooled prevalence. Subgroup, sensitivity and meta-regression analyses were performed to address heterogeneity while Egger's test for publication bias. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: We identified 39 studies, comprising a total of 11,875 enterococcal isolates. The result of the analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of VRE in Asia was 8.10% (95% CI; 7-9; I(2) = 93.79%; p < 0.001). Resistance to vancomycin was greater among strains of E. faecium compared to the strains of E. faecalis (22.40% vs. 3.70%). Amongst various regions of Asia, the highest prevalence of VRE was found in the Western Asian region and the lowest in the South-east Asian region. Moreover, the rate of VRE was higher than most European countries and lower than USA.

We found that the transfer of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis increased more than 30-fold upon treatment by streptomycin. Notably, treatment with an antibiotic caused the bacteria to become resistant to another. The response was even stronger in the well-studied plasmid pCF10 and the number of transconjugants increased about 100,000-fold. We tested four different antibiotics, and all of them induced conjugal response. Through a mathematical model based on gene regulation, we found a plausible explanation.

Our study aims to characterize the epidemiology, associated conditions, and outcomes of VRE infections among hospitalized patients in the U.S. military health system (MHS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with VRE infection using the MHS database. Cases included all patients admitted to a military treatment facility for >/=2 days from October 2008 to September 2015 with a clinical culture growing Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus species (unspecified), reported as resistant to vancomycin. Co-morbid conditions and procedures associated with VRE infection were identified by multivariable conditional logistic regression. Patient case-mix adjusted outcomes including in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospitalization cost were evaluated by high-dimensional propensity score adjustment. RESULTS: During the seven-year study period and among 1,161,335 hospitalized patients within the MHS, we identified 577 (0.05%) patients with VRE infection. A majority of VRE infections were urinary tract infections (57.7%), followed by bloodstream (24.7%), other site/device-related (12.9%), respiratory (2.9%), and wound infections (1.8%). Risk factors for VRE infection included invasive gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and urologic procedures, indwelling devices, and exposure to 4th generation cephalosporins, but not to glycopeptides. Patients hospitalized with VRE infection had significantly higher hospitalization costs (attributable difference [AD] $135,534, P<0.001), prolonged hospital stays (AD 20.44 days, P<0.001, and higher in-hospital mortality (case-mix adjusted odds ratio 5.77; 95% confidence interval 4.59-7.25). CONCLUSIONS: VRE infections carry a considerable burden for hospitalized patients given their impact on length of stay, hospitalization costs, and in-hospital mortality. Active surveillance and infection control efforts should target those identified as high-risk for VRE infection. Antimicrobial stewardship programs should focus on limiting exposure to 4th generation cephalosporins.",1930-613X (Electronic) 0026-4075 (Linking),2021 Jan 25,,"['6119441 [pii]', '10.1093/milmed/usaa229 [doi]']",['eng'],England,,"['Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military', 'Surgeons of the United States 2021.

Combination antibiotic therapies have a distinct advantage over monotherapies in terms of their synergistic effect. In the study, it was aimed to investigate in vitro activity of vancomycin combined with fosfomycin by agar dilution method against VRE strains. METHODS: A total of 30 clinical VRE strains were included in the study. Bacterial identifications of the strains were undertaken using conventional routine methods. The resistance to vancomycin was investigated using the broth microdilution method compared to fosfomycin by agar dilution method, and the results were interpreted in accordance with the CLSI guidelines. All experiments contained 25 mg/mL glucose-6-phosphate for fosfomycin. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indexes (FICI) were interpreted as synergism, FICI </= 0.5. Additionally, two strains in 30 VRE were studied to determine the time-kill curves to verify the synergistic results. Both antibiotics were studied at 1 x MIC in the tests. Viable counts were determined at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24-hour intervals. Time-kill curves were constructed by plotting mean colony forming unit counts versus time. RESULTS: Susceptibility rate to fosfomycin was found at 16.6% (5/30). The MIC50,90 and MICrange values of antimi-crobials were 512, 512, and 512 - 1,024 mg/L for vancomycin, and 128, 128, and 64 - 160 mg/L for fosfomycin. The rate of synergism was found as 100%.

In this prospective study we analysed if vanB-mediated vancomycin resistance can be reliably detected by Vitek2. METHODS: One thousand, three hundred and forty-four enterococcal isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested by Vitek2 (bioMerieux, Nurtingen, Germany). Additionally, a bacterial suspension (with a turbidity equivalent to that of a 0.5 McFarland standard) was inoculated on chromID VRE screening agar (bioMerieux) and incubated for 48 h. If vancomycin tested susceptible by Vitek2 but growth was detected on the screening agar, PCR for vanA/vanB was performed (GeneXpert vanA/B test, Cepheid, Frankfurt, Germany). For isolates that tested susceptible to vancomycin by Vitek2 but were vanA/B positive, MICs were determined before and after cultivation in broth with increasing concentrations of vancomycin. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six out of 491 E. faecium were VRE and were predominantly vanB positive (81.0%). Of these, Vitek2 did not identify 14 as VRE (sensitivity 91.0%). By broth microdilution 9/14 isolates demonstrated high MICs (>/=32 mg/L) and 5/14 showed low vancomycin MICs, which did not increase despite vancomycin exposure. Three of the 14 isolates demonstrated growth on chromID VRE; after vancomycin exposure seven additional isolates were able to grow on chromID VRE. CONCLUSIONS: Vitek2 fails to detect vanB-mediated vancomycin resistance consistently, especially, but not limited to, low-level resistance. As this may lead to treatment failure and further dissemination of vanB VRE, additional methods (e.g. culture on VRE screening agar or PCR) are necessary to reliably identify vanB-positive enterococci in clinical routine.",1460-2091 (Electronic) 0305-7453 (Linking),2021 Apr 14,,"['6225960 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkab101 [doi]']",['eng'],England,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

To control hospital-associated infections, skin antisepsis and bathing utilizing chlorhexidine is recommended for VRE patients in acute care hospitals. Previously, we reported that exposure to inhibitory chlorhexidine levels induced the expression of vancomycin resistance genes in VanA-type Enterococcus faecium. However, vancomycin susceptibility actually increased for VanA-type E. faecium in the presence of chlorhexidine. Hence, a synergistic effect of the two antimicrobials was observed. In this study, we used multiple approaches to investigate the mechanism of synergism between chlorhexidine and vancomycin in the VanA-type VRE strain E. faecium 1,231,410. We generated clean deletions of 7 of 11 pbp, transpeptidase, and carboxypeptidase genes in this strain (ponA, pbpF, pbpZ, pbpA, ddcP, ldtfm, and vanY). Deletion of ddcP, encoding a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase, altered the synergism phenotype. Furthermore, using in vitro evolution, we isolated a spontaneous synergy escaper mutant and utilized whole genome sequencing to determine that a mutation in pstB, encoding an ATPase of phosphate-specific transporters, also altered synergism. Finally, addition of excess D-lactate, but not D-alanine, enhanced synergism to reduce vancomycin MIC levels.

The resistance towards glycopeptide antibiotics is mediated by the so-called van genes. Currently, the most common resistance type in Germany is the vanB-type. Little data are available on the molecular epidemiology in Germany. Therefore, an epidemiological typing of Enterococcus faecium isolates with vanB-type resistance from two German hospitals in Essen and Nuremberg was performed. Two outbreaks and 104 sporadic cases were investigated. Methods: All 128 isolates with vanB-type resistance were collected between 2011-2012 and 2017-2018. They were characterized using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: ST 117 was the most common sequence type (ST) in both hospitals, especially since 2017. PFGE divided the isolates of this study into 68 PFGE types and showed a broad genetic diversity. Two epidemiologically assumed in-hospital outbreaks were genetically confirmed. Apart from that, in-hospital transmissions were rare events. Conclusion: The results obtained by MLST confirmed the previously described allocation of STs in Germany. PFGE showed a broad genetic diversity of vanB VRE between the two hospitals and also within each hospital. In-hospital transmissions were rare, but outbreaks did occur.

This study aimed to explore whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based approaches in epidemiological typing of VRE by investigating a collection of ST80 strains. METHODS: In total, 41 VRE ST80 isolates in three suspected transmission chains were subjected to WGS. The genetic relationship of the isolates was analysed by core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based typing. The published genome sequence of a predominant ST80 clone in Copenhagen was also included in the analyses. RESULTS: Group 1 isolates (n = 10) were recovered in the same geographic area, including two isolates from an outbreak of vanA genotype. Group 2 isolates (n = 4) were detected from another outbreak. Group 3 consisted of 3 non-outbreak isolates and 24 representative isolates from an outbreak of vanB genotype. Our findings indicated >/=24 allelic difference and >16 SNPs as the cut-off for excluding VRE strains from an outbreak. cgMLST identified >200 differing alleles between genomes of the Copenhagen clone and outbreak strains in this study. Our findings also demonstrated that SNP analysis was not suitable for typing samples from different groups, even with the same ST, owing to lack of an optimal reference genome.

The aim of this study was to provide baseline data on VRE intestinal carriage among high-risk patients in Serbian university hospitals, to determine the phenotypic/genotypic profiles of the isolated VRE, to obtain knowledge of local resistance patterns and bridge the gaps in current VRE surveillance. METHODS: The VRE reservoir was investigated using stool samples from 268 inpatients. Characterization of isolated VRE stains consisted of BD Phoenix system, genotypic identification, glycopeptide and quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D) resistance probing, virulence gene (esp, hyl, efaA, asa1, gelE, cpd) detection and MLVA.

Administration of E. hirae UPM02 had significant effects on the specific growth rate (SGR), feed utilization efficiency, body indices (P < 0.05), and gut villus physiology of the catfish. E. hirae UPM02 application also significantly increased the complete blood cell counts, phagocytic activity, respiratory burst, lysozyme activity, and alternative complement pathway hemolytic (ACH50) activity in tested catfish throughout the experimental periods (P < 0.05). Dietary E. hirae UPM02 at both concentrations significantly increased the expression levels of the alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha2M), CC chemokines, CXC chemokines, lysozyme c (LYZC), myeloperoxidase (MYE), NF-kappa-B1 p105 subunit (NF-K), and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPIP) genes in the head kidney, liver, and spleen (P < 0.05) at days 80, 100 and 120 after application. However, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene expression was slightly downregulated in these organs. Interestingly, fish fed the diets containing 2 x 10(5) and 2 x 10(7) CFU/g E. hirae UPM02 exhibited a significantly lower (P < 0.05) postchallenge mortality rates (32% and 30%, respectively) after 14 days of A. hydrophila challenge than the control fish (58%). In short-term (28 days) application to juvenile catfish, the two concentrations of E. hirae did not affect all growth parameters. Nevertheless, these concentrations markedly elevated all tested immune parameters, similarly to long-term application. Immune-related gene expression was significantly upregulated at day 28 in the head kidney, at day 14 in the liver, and at day 7 in the spleen in fish treated with the two concentrations of the probiotics (P < 0.05).

Comparative genomic analyses with related and clinically significant enterococci were further undertaken to infer the evolutionary history of the bacterium and identify genes both novel and absent. The genome had a G + C content of 35.1%, consisted of a circular chromosome, no plasmids, and was 2,419,934 bp in length (2,321 genes, 47 tRNAs, and 13 rRNAs). Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of multiple E. lacertideformus samples revealed they were effectively indistinguishable from one another and highly clonal. E. lacertideformus was found to be located within the Enterococcus faecium species clade and was closely related to Enterococcus villorum F1129D based on 16S rDNA and MLST house-keeping gene analysis. Antimicrobial resistance (DfreE, EfrB, tetM, bcrRABD, and sat4) and virulence genes (Fss3 and ClpP), and genes conferring tolerance to metals and biocides (n = 9) were identified. The detection of relatively few genes encoding antimicrobial resistance and virulence indicates that this bacterium may have had no exposure to recently developed and clinically significant antibiotics. Genes potentially imparting beneficial functional properties were identified, including prophages, insertion elements, integrative conjugative elements, and genomic islands. Functional CRISPR-Cas arrays, and a defective prophage region were identified in the genome. The study also revealed many genomic loci unique to E. lacertideformus which contained genes enriched in cell wall/membrane/envelop biogenesis, and carbohydrate metabolism and transport functionality. This finding and the detection of putative enterococcal biofilm determinants (EfaAfs, srtC, and scm) may underpin the novel biofilm phenotype observed for this bacterium. Comparative analysis of E. lacertideformus with phylogenetically related and clinically significant enterococci (E. villorum F1129D, Enterococcus hirae R17, E. faecium AUS0085, and Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF) revealed an absence of genes (n = 54) in E. lacertideformus, that encode metabolic functionality, which potentially hinders nutrient acquisition and/or utilization by the bacterium and precludes growth in vitro.

The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in hospital-adapted enterococci had been thought to originate from livestock. However, this association between livestock and hospital-adapted enterococci is currently unclear. This study investigates the antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococci isolated from pig cecal samples and compares the genomic characteristics of Enterococcus faecium from pigs to those of isolates from meat chickens and from human sepsis cases. From 200 cecal samples, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for E. faecium (n = 84), E. hirae (n = 36), and E. faecalis (n = 17). Whole-genome sequencing was performed for all E. faecium isolates, and the sequences were compared to those of previously studied isolates from meat chickens and human sepsis cases through bioinformatics analysis. Resistance (non-wild type) to erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, ampicillin, daptomycin, virginiamycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin was identified. More importantly, except for a single isolate harboring the vanC operon, no resistance was observed in the three species to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid, which are critically important antimicrobials used to treat enterococcal infections in humans. The E. faecium isolates from chickens were genetically distinct from human and pig isolates, which were more closely related. Human strains that were closely related to pig strains were not typical ""hospital-adapted strains"" as previously identified. The results of this study show that enterococci from Australian finisher pigs are not a source of resistance to critically important antimicrobials and that E. faecium from pigs is not part of the current human hospital-adapted population.IMPORTANCE Resistance to the critically important antimicrobials vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid is not found in enterococci collected from Australian finisher pigs. However, some antimicrobial resistance was observed. In particular, resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin, a combination of two streptogramin class antimicrobials, was identified despite the absence of streptogramin use Australia-wide since 2005. Other observed resistance among enterococci from pigs include chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistance. Genomic comparison of E. faecium from Australian pigs to isolates collected from previous studies on chickens and humans indicate that E. faecium from pigs are genetically more similar to those of humans than those from chickens. Despite the increased genetic similarities, E. faecium strains from pigs are phylogenetically distinct and did not belong to the dominant sequence types found in hospital-adapted strains causing sepsis in humans. Therefore, the results indicate that Australian finisher pigs are not a source of hospital-adapted E. faecium in Australia.",1098-5336 (Electronic) 0099-2240 (Linking),2021 Apr 27,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5456-3162', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7362-8323', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0950-2317']","['AEM.03037-20 [pii]', '10.1128/AEM.03037-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['agriculture', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'enterococci', 'genetics', 'pigs', 'porcine']",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society for Microbiology.'],,

In this study, we investigated the occurrence of linezolid-resistant enterococci in marine samples from two coastal areas in Italy. Isolates grown on florfenicol-supplemented Slanetz-Bartley agar plates were investigated for their carriage of optrA, poxtA, and cfr genes; optrA was found in one Enterococcus faecalis isolate, poxtA was found in three Enterococcus faecium isolates and two Enterococcus hirae isolates, and cfr was not found. Two of the three poxtA-carrying E. faecium isolates and the two E. hirae isolates showed related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. Two E. faecium isolates belonged to the new sequence type 1710, which clustered in clonal complex 94, encompassing nosocomial strains. S1 PFGE/hybridization assays showed a double (chromosome and plasmid) location of poxtA and a plasmid location of optrA Whole-genome sequencing revealed that poxtA was contained in a Tn6657-like element carried by two plasmids (pEfm-EF3 and pEh-GE2) of similar size, found in different species, and that poxtA was flanked by two copies of IS1216 in both plasmids. In mating experiments, all but one strain (E. faecalis EN3) were able to transfer the poxtA gene to E. faecium 64/3. The occurrence of linezolid resistance genes in enterococci from marine samples is of great concern and highlights the need to improve practices aimed at limiting the transmission of linezolid-resistant strains to humans from environmental reservoirs.IMPORTANCE Linezolid is one of the few antimicrobials available to treat severe infections due to drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria; therefore, the emergence of linezolid-resistant enterococci carrying transferable resistance determinants is of great concern for public health. Linezolid resistance genes (cfr, optrA, and poxtA), often plasmid located, can be transmitted via horizontal gene transfer and have the potential to spread globally. This study highlights the detection of enterococci carrying linezolid resistance genes from sediment and zooplankton samples from two coastal urban areas in Italy.

Notably, fecal enterococci are suitable indicators for monitoring antimicrobial resistance dissemination. Resistant bacterial strains recovered from the fecal samples of wild animals can highlight important aspects of environmental disturbances. In this report, we investigated antimicrobial susceptibility as well as resistance and virulence genes in fecal enterococci isolated from wild Pampas foxes (Lycalopex gymnocercus) (n = 5) and Geoffroy's cats (Leopardus geoffroyi) (n = 4) in the Brazilian Pampa biome. Enterococci were isolated from eight out of nine fecal samples and Enterococcus faecalis was identified in both animals. However, E. faecium and E. durans were only detected in Pampas foxes, while E. hirae was only detected in Geoffroy's cats. Antimicrobial susceptibility analysis showed resistance to rifampicin (94%), erythromycin (72.6%), ciprofloxacin/norfloxacin (40%), streptomycin (38%), and tetracycline (26%). The high frequency of multidrug-resistant enterococci (66%) isolated in this study is a matter of concern since these are wild animals with no history of therapeutic antibiotic exposure. The tetM/tetL and msrC/ermB genes were detected in most tetracycline- and erythromycin-resistant enterococci, respectively. The gelE, ace, agg, esp, and clyA virulence genes were also detected in enterococci. In conclusion, our data suggest that habitat fragmentation and anthropogenic activities in the Pampa biome may contribute to high frequencies of multidrug-resistant enterococci in the gut communities of wild Pampas foxes and Geoffroy's cats.

In this article, we report the first case of urinary tract infection-related bacteremia due to E. hirae from Turkey. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old male patient with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic renal failure was admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain, dysuria, and fever. The urine sample collected from the urinary catheter resulted as ampicillin-sensitive E. hirae. On the 4th day of hospitalization, E. hirae growth with the same sensitivity pattern was also reported in blood culture. Intravenous ampicillin 4x2 g/day treatment was initiated. There was no growth in subsequent blood and urine cultures. Fever resolved and general condition improved. The patient was discharged on the thirteenth day with clinical improvement after moxifloxacin treatment for four days and ampicillin treatment for nine days. DISCUSSION: The patient's medical history included risk factors for enterococcal bacteremia. There are a limited number of reports in the literature describing human infections caused by E. hirae. The reason for the rare isolation of E. hirae from clinical specimens may be the difficulty of identifying with standard diagnostic approaches.

In contrast to other mammalian in vivo infection models, even one of PdpC, PdpD or OpiA T6SS effectors is sufficient to kill G. mellonella larvae while sheath recycling by ClpB is dispensable. We further demonstrate that treatment by polyethylene glycol (PEG) activates Francisella T6SS in liquid culture and that this is independent of the response regulator PmrA. PEG-activated IglC secretion is dependent on T6SS structural component PdpB but independent of putative effectors PdpC, PdpD, AnmK and OpiB1-3.

Due to its extremely high virulence, ease of spread by aerosolization, and the potential to be used as a bioterror agent, F. tularensis is classified by the CDC as a Tier 1 Category A Select Agent. Previous studies have demonstrated the roles of inflammasome sensors; absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and NLRP3, in the generation of innate immune responses to F. tularensis infection. However, contributions of both the AIM2 and NLRP3 in the development of vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses against F. tularensis are not known. This study determined the contributions of Aim2 and Nlrp3-inflammasome sensors in vaccine-induced immune responses in a mouse model of respiratory tularemia. We developed a model to vaccinate the Aim2 and Nlrp3-deficient mice (Aim2(-/-) and Nlrp3(-/-) ) using the emrA1 mutant of F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS). The results demonstrate that the innate immune responses in Aim2(-/-) and Nlrp3(-/-) mice vaccinated with the emrA1 mutant differ from their wild-type counterparts. However, despite these differences in the innate immune responses, both Aim2(-/-) and Nlrp3(-/-) mice are fully protected against an intranasal lethal challenge dose of F. tularensis LVS. Moreover, the lack of both Aim2 and Nlrp3 inflammasome sensors does not affect the production of the vaccination-induced antibody and cell-mediated responses.

Its full potential as a target for tuberculosis treatment has not yet been exploited because of the lack of potent inhibitors available. By screening over 1500 small molecules, we have identified new potent and selective inhibitors of SapM with an uncompetitive mechanism of inhibition. The best inhibitors share a trihydroxy-benzene moiety essential for activity. Importantly, the inhibitors significantly reduce mycobacterial burden in infected human macrophages at 1 microM, and they are selective with respect to other mycobacterial and human phosphatases. The best inhibitor also reduces intracellular burden of Francisella tularensis, which secretes the virulence factor AcpA, a homologue of SapM, with the same mechanism of catalysis and inhibition. Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of SapM with small molecule inhibitors is efficient in reducing intracellular mycobacterial survival in host macrophages and confirm SapM as a potential therapeutic target.

The highest seroprevalence was for WNV with 71% (20/28) of coyotes testing antibody-positive. Seroprevalence of CDV and plague were lower, 27% and 13%, respectively. No evidence of active infection with tularemia or heartworm was seen in the coyotes sampled. As this study did not sample black-footed ferrets themselves, the definitive cause for the decline of this population cannot be determined. However, the presence of coyotes seropositive for two diseases, plague and CDV, lethal to black-footed ferrets, indicated the potential for exposure and infection. The high seroprevalence of WNV in the coyotes indicated a wide exposure to the virus; therefore, exposure of black-footed ferrets to the virus is also likely. Due to the ability of WNV to cause fatal disease in other species, studies may be useful to elucidate the impact that WNV could have on the success of reintroduced black-footed ferrets as well as factors influencing the spread and incidence of the disease in a prairie ecosystem.",1943-3700 (Electronic) 0090-3558 (Linking),2021 Apr 1,,"['449733 [pii]', '10.7589/JWD-D-20-00015 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['Black-footed ferret', 'West Nile virus', 'canine distemper virus', 'coyote', 'plague', 'serosurvey']",['(c) Wildlife Disease Association 2021.'],,

The study of ubiquitination has become essential to learning about host-pathogen interactions, and a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms through which pathogens affect ubiquitination processes in host cell will contribute to vaccine development and effective treatment of diseases. Pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Salmonella enterica, Legionella pneumophila and Shigella flexneri) encode many effector proteins, such as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), targeting the host ubiquitin machinery and thus disrupting pertinent ubiquitin-dependent anti-bacterial response. We focus here upon the host ubiquitination system as an integral unit, its interconnection with the regulation of inflammation and autophagy, and primarily while examining pathogens manipulating the host ubiquitination system. Many bacterial effector proteins have already been described as being translocated into the host cell, where they directly regulate host defense processes. Due to their importance in pathogenic bacteria progression within the host, they are regarded as virulence factors essential for bacterial evasion. However, in some cases (e.g., Francisella tularensis) the host ubiquitination system is influenced by bacterial infection, although the responsible bacterial effectors are still unknown.",2076-2607 (Print) 2076-2607 (Linking),2021 Mar 19,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3734-1023', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3263-4107']","['microorganisms9030638 [pii]', '10.3390/microorganisms9030638 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs)', 'effector protein', 'host-pathogen interaction', 'ubiquitination']",,,

Signs/symptoms associated with GSM may occur during any reproductive stage from multiple etiologies but are most common during menopause due to low estrogen. Vaginal microbiota, particularly Lactobacillus spp., are beneficial to the female genital tract; however, their abundance declines during menopause. We aimed to longitudinally assess vaginal microbiota characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and GSM-associated endpoints across reproductive stages. In a two-year cohort study of 750 women aged 35-60 years at enrollment and 2,111 semiannual person-visits, low-Lactobacillus vaginal microbiota communities were observed at 21.2% (169/798), 22.9% (137/597), and 49.7% (356/716) of person-visits among pre-, peri-, and postmenopausal women, respectively (p<.001).

BV is a highly prevalent disorder of the vaginal microbiota among women of reproductive age globally. BV is confirmed to be associated with adverse gynecologic and obstetric outcomes, such as sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and preterm birth. Gardnerella vaginalis is the most common microorganism identified from BV. It is the predominant microbe in polymicrobial biofilms that could shelter G. vaginalis and other BV-associated microbes from adverse host environments. Many efforts have been made to increase our understanding of the vaginal microbiome in health and BV.

Mounting evidence collected using diverse methodologies points to the conclusion that BV is associated with a reduction in intact sialoglycans in cervico-vaginal secretions. Here we review evidence for the contributions of vaginal bacteria, especially Gardnerella, in the processes of mucosal sialoglycan degradation, uptake, metabolism, and depletion.

It is currently unknown which parameters of the vaginal environment are affected and how smoking triggers the disease. AIM OF THE STUDY: The primary objective is to estimate the effect size of smoking on vaginal pH and the Nugent score in patients with chronic vulvovaginal discomfort prior to the development of episode of vaginosis. The secondary goal is to investigate the effect of smoking on individual microscopic parameters of the vaginal environment and on subjectively reported symptoms of vaginal discomfort. METHODS: Smoking reported by patients was tested as a predictor, using multivariate logistic and ordinal logistic regression analysis on a dataset from the first visit of a randomized trial NCT04171947, which enrolled patients with intermediate vaginal environment. We tested the primary hypothesis (odds ratio (OR) for vaginal pH &gt; 4.5 and Nugent score &gt; 3 in smokers) at the significance level a = 5%. For exploratory analyses of the effect of smoking on the parameters of the vaginal environment, a was corrected as per Bonferoni. RESULTS: In a cross-sectional sample of 250 women after adjusting for other risk factors, smoking had an impact on the Nugent score (OR = 3.3 (1.3-8.5), P = 0.011), while pH was not affected (OR = 1.2 (0.5-2.8), P = 0.698).

The objective of this paper is to present, to new generations of the specialty in the Greater Maghreb, this leading teacher from the Center-East of Tunisia (Monastir), through the testimonies of his companions, and his indexed publications. All the colleagues of the late SOLTANI testified to his high human and professional qualities, particularly perseverance, commitment, forward thinking, integrity and professionalism. The scientific life of the late Professor Soltani was oriented towards two major themes: Public Health and Family Medicine. Indeed, the deceased has developed several new preventive activities in first-line structures such as anonymous and free HIV screening, family planning, rational use of drugs, breast cancer screening, smoking cessation, prevention of rheumatic heart disease. Pr SOLTANI welcomed general practitioners from the Monastir region to the Faculty's Community Medicine Department, creating with them a movement to advocate for the academic and professional development of general medicine into an authentic specialty of family medicine. Out of the 34 publications of Professor SOLTANI, indexed on PubMed, 11 were signed by himself in first position, mainly relating to maternal health (prenatal surveillance, education for maternal health, pregnancy referral system) and infant (low birth weight, vaccination, mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B, meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae). Thus, with a life prospering by innovations and research in public health, Professor SOLTANI will always remain a model for young people in the specialty of Preventive and Community Medicine.

Inflammatory diseases of periodontal tissues, in particular generalized forms of periodontitis, reach 80% in the world. The tendency of increasing the prevalence rate of these diseases in Ukraine, 60-99%, is being observed nowadays. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity of three gel-based medicinal products, being widely used in periodontology: Abigel, an herbal remedy, containing fir oil and oak bark extract; Fitoron, which contains oak bark extract, and President gel with chlorhexidine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, belonging to different taxonomic groups: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 and Proteus vulgaris ATCC 4636, Candida albicans ATCC 885-653, were as a substrate for further examinations. Preparing the suspensions of microorganisms with a defined optical density of microbial cells was executed using the turbidity standard (0.5 McFarland standard). The Densi-La-Meter device (made by ""PLIVA-Lachema"", Czech Republic; wavelength = 540 nm) was used. The suspension was prepared in accordance with the device guidance and the information sheet on innovations in the health care system No. 163-2006 ""Standardization of preparation of microbial suspensions"". RESULTS: The highest activity against Staphylococcus aureus is being observed in President gel with chlorhexidine (24 mm and 25 mm), followed by Abigel gel (20, 21, 22 mm) and Fitoron has the minimum activity (17 and 18 mm). The growth zone of Bacillus subtilis is maximally inhibited by President gel with chlorhexidine (25 and 26 mm), Fitoron's inhibition zone is of 23 and 24 mm, and in the last place is Abigel gel - 20 and 21 mm. President gel with chlorhexidine has a pronounced antifungal effect with the inhibition zone of 20, 21 and 22 mm, Fitoron's inhibition zone is of 19 and 20 mm, and one of Abigel gel - of 16 and 17 mm. Concerning Enterococcus faecalis, the highest activity was established in President gel with chlorhexidine (the inhibition zone of 22 and 23 mm), Abigel gel had inhibition zone of 20 and 21 mm, whereas one of Fitoron was of 18 and 19 mm. Haemophilus influenzae was maximally influenced by President gel with chlorhexidine with the inhibition zone of 19 and 20 mm, Abigel gel caused the growth inhibition by 17 and 18 mm, and the lowest growth inhibition was of Fitoron - 16 mm. President gel with chlorhexidine (19, 20, 21 mm) and Abigel gel (19 mm) had almost the same influence on the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas these figures of Fitoron were 16 and 17 mm. Abigel gel had a pronounced activity against Streptococcus mutans with the inhibition zone of 20 mm, one of President gel with chlorhexidine was of 19 and 20 mm, and of Fitoron - 17 and 18 mm. The growth of Neisseria sp was maximally inhibited by President gel with chlorhexidine (18, 19, 20 mm), in the second place was Abigel gel (18, 19 mm) and the lowest results were of Fitoron (16, 17 mm). CONCLUSIONS: President gel with chlorhexidine, Fitoron and Abigel gel have pronounced antimicrobial properties as to the testing cultures of microorganisms under study.

Here we used an integrated approach including X-ray crystallography, genetics and molecular biology to investigate the function and structure of YhcB. The E. coli yhcB knock-out strain does not grow at 45 degrees C and is hypersensitive to cell-wall acting antibiotics, even in stationary phase. The deletion of yhcB leads to filamentation, abnormal FtsZ ring formation, and aberrant septa development. The Z-ring is essential for the positioning of the septa and the initiation of cell division. We found that YhcB interacts with proteins of the divisome (e.g., FtsI, FtsQ) and elongasome (e.g., RodZ, RodA). Seven of these interactions are also conserved in Yersinia pestis and/or Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, we mapped the amino acid residues likely involved in the interactions of YhcB with FtsI and RodZ. The 2.8 A crystal structure of the cytosolic domain of Haemophilus ducreyi YhcB shows a unique tetrameric alpha-helical coiled-coil structure likely to be involved in linking the Z ring to the septal peptidoglycan synthesizing complexes. In summary, YhcB is a conserved and conditionally essential protein that plays a role in cell division, and consequently affects envelope biogenesis. Based on these findings, we propose to rename YhcB to ZapG (Z-ring associated protein G).

Whilst many studies have reported the aetiology of pneumonia in Western countries, the epidemiology of pneumonia in Malaysia remains poorly understood. As carriage is a prerequisite for disease, we sought to improve our understanding of the carriage and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of respiratory tract pathogens in Malaysia. The rural communities of Sarawak are an understudied part of the Malaysian population and were the focus of this study, allowing us to gain a better understanding of bacterial epidemiology in this population. METHODS: A population-based survey of bacterial carriage was undertaken in participants of all ages from rural communities in Sarawak, Malaysia. Nasopharyngeal, nasal, mouth and oropharyngeal swabs were taken. Bacteria were isolated from each swab and identified by culture-based methods and antimicrobial susceptibility testing conducted by disk diffusion or E test. RESULTS: 140 participants were recruited from five rural communities. Klebsiella pneumoniae was most commonly isolated from participants (30.0%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (20.7%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (9.3%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%) and Neisseria meningitidis (5.0%). Of the 21 S. pneumoniae isolated, 33.3 and 14.3% were serotypes included in the 13 valent PCV (PCV13) and 10 valent PCV (PCV10) respectively. 33.8% of all species were resistant to at least one antibiotic, however all bacterial species except S. pneumoniae were susceptible to at least one type of antibiotic. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first bacterial carriage study undertaken in East Malaysia. We provide valuable and timely data regarding the epidemiology and AMR of respiratory pathogens commonly associated with pneumonia. Further surveillance in Malaysia is necessary to monitor changes in the carriage prevalence of upper respiratory tract pathogens and the emergence of AMR, particularly as PCV is added to the National Immunisation Programme (NIP).",2200-6133 (Print) 2200-6133 (Linking),2021 Apr 25,,"['10.1186/s41479-021-00084-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s41479-021-00084-9 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['AMR', 'Carriage', 'Malaysia', 'Pathogen', 'Pneumonia', 'Respiratory']",,,

This study compared the oral and esophageal microbiota of patients with achalasia before and after peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). It also compared patients with achalasia to those with ESCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study prospectively examined 6 patients with achalasia and 14 with superficial ESCC. Oral samples obtained from the buccal mucosa using a swab and esophageal samples obtained from the mid-esophagus using a brush via endoscopy were analyzed by 16S rRNA metagenome sequencing. Additionally, endoscopic and histological findings of patients with achalasia before and after POEM were prospectively compared. RESULTS: In patients with achalasia, Streptococcus was most abundant in both the oral and the esophageal microbiota, and these microbiota were significantly different. Although the overall structure of the oral and esophageal microbiota did not change after POEM, the relative abundance rate of Haemophilus and Neisseria increased in the esophagus, and endoscopic findings of inflammation improved after POEM (P = .04). The relative abundance of microbiota was not different among patients with achalasia from those with ESCC. CONCLUSIONS: The oral and esophageal microbiota were significantly different in patients with achalasia, and some of the composition of the esophageal microbiota changed after POEM.

We aimed to assess the prevalence of the species in clinical specimens, and characterise population structure and resistance to aminopenicillins by whole genome sequencing.We assessed the point prevalence by entering the database records of 1 day in Denmark and examined the genome sequences of nationwide, collected isolates from the same day. The prevalence of H. influenzae in clinical samples on the 10th of January 2018 was 1.78 per 100,000 person-days (all samples), and 2.47 per 1000 hospital bed-days (hospital samples). Of 2009 bacteria deemed clinically relevant and collected in a concerted action by the Danish departments of clinical microbiology, 62 (3.1%) were H. influenzae. All 62 isolates belonged to phylogenetic group I and were unencapsulated. Three strains from separate Danish regions had identical core genome sequences, but a small number of intergenic mutations testified to circulating clones, rather than individual cases of patient-to-patient transmission. The TEM-1 beta-lactamase gene was present in 24 strains, while 13 strains were genetically categorised as ampicillin-resistant due to substitutions in penicillin-binding protein 3; shared patterns of amino acid substitutions in unrelated strains indicated putative lateral transfer of chromosomal resistance. Circulating clones of H. influenzae are frequent, and host factors, rather than direct transmission of epidemic strains, may be the primary cause of infection.

We therefore characterized the conjunctival microbiome of T2DM patients and the influence of topical levofloxacin to investigate whether a dysbiosis is associated with this phenomenon. Methods: Conjunctival microbiome of 79 T2DM patients and 113 non-diabetic controls was profiled using the 16S rDNA sequencing approach. Furthermore, 21 T2DM and 14 non-diabetic patients who underwent cataract surgeries were followed up perioperatively and the influence of pre- and post-operative levofloxacin on the conjunctival microbiome was further investigated prospectively and compared longitudinally. Results: The alpha-diversity of the conjunctival microbiota was significantly higher in T2DM patients than in controls (P < 0.05). Significant differences in both composition and function of the conjunctival microbiome were identified on the ocular surface of T2DM patients as compared to non-diabetic controls. Particularly, phylum Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, genus Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, and Empedobacter were enriched, while genus Streptococcus was reduced on the T2DM ocular surface. Microbial genes functioning of bacterial chemotaxis was elevated in the conjunctival microbiome of T2DM patients. Furthermore, compared to the initial status, several genera including Staphylococcus were more abundant in the conjunctival microbiome of T2DM patients after 3-days use of preoperative levofloxacin topically, while no genus was more abundant in the non-diabetic follow-up group. No difference was observed between initial status and 7 days after ceasing all postoperative medications in both diabetic and non-diabetic follow-up groups. Conclusions: The conjunctival microbiome of T2DM patients was more complex and may respond differently to topical antibiotics.",2296-858X (Print) 2296-858X (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fmed.2021.605639 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Staphylococcus', 'cataract surgery', 'conjunctival microbiota', 'levofloxacin', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhu, Wei, Rong, Zhang, Zhang, Wen, He, Zhang, Chen, Wei and', 'Lu.']",,

In previous studies, we demonstrated that the active Cdt subunit, CdtB, is a potent phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3,4,5-triphosphate phosphatase. Moreover, AaCdt-treated cells exhibit evidence of PI-3-kinase (PI-3K) signaling blockade characterized by reduced levels of PIP3, pAkt, and pGSK3beta. We have also demonstrated that PI-3K blockade is a requisite of AaCdt-induced toxicity in lymphocytes. In this study, we extended our observations to include assessment of Cdts from Haemophilus ducreyi (HdCdt) and Campylobacter jejuni (CjCdt). We now report that the CdtB subunit from HdCdt and CjCdt, similar to that of AaCdt, exhibit potent PIP3 phosphatase activity and that Jurkat cells treated with these Cdts exhibit PI-3K signaling blockade: reduced levels of pAkt and pGSK3beta. Since non-phosphorylated GSK3beta is the active form of this kinase, we compared Cdts for dependence on GSK3beta activity. Two GSK3beta inhibitors were employed, LY2090314 and CHIR99021; both inhibitors blocked the ability of Cdts to induce cell cycle arrest. We have previously demonstrated that AaCdt induces increases in the CDK inhibitor, p21(CIP1/WAF1), and, further, that this was a requisite for toxin-induced cell death via apoptosis. We now demonstrate that HdCdt and CjCdt also share this requirement. It is also noteworthy that p21(CIP1/WAF1) was not involved in the ability of the three Cdts to induce cell cycle arrest. Finally, we demonstrate that, like AaCdt, HdCdt is dependent upon the host cell protein, cellugyrin, for its toxicity (and presumably internalization of CdtB); CjCdt was not dependent upon this protein.

Pathogenesis is dependent on avoiding phagocytosis and exploiting the suppurative granuloma-like niche, which contains a myriad of innate immune cells and memory T cells. Despite this immune infiltrate, long-lived immune protection does not develop against repeated H. ducreyi infections-even with the same strain. Most of what we know about infectious skin diseases comes from naturally occurring infections and/or animal models; however, for H. ducreyi, this information comes from an experimental model of infection in human volunteers that was developed nearly three decades ago. The model mirrors the progression of natural disease and serves as a valuable tool to determine the composition of the immune cell infiltrate early in disease and to identify host and bacterial factors that are required for the establishment of infection and disease progression. Most recently, holistic investigation of the experimentally infected skin microenvironment using multiple ""omics"" techniques has revealed that non-canonical bacterial virulence factors, such as genes involved in central metabolism, may be relevant to disease progression. Thus, the immune system not only defends the host against H. ducreyi, but also dictates the nutrient availability for the invading bacteria, which must adapt their gene expression to exploit the inflammatory metabolic niche. These findings have broadened our view of the host-pathogen interaction network from considering only classical, effector-based virulence paradigms to include adaptations to the metabolic environment. How both host and bacterial factors interact to determine infection outcome is a current focus in the field. Here, we review what we have learned from experimental H. ducreyi infection about host-pathogen interactions, make comparisons to what is known for other skin pathogens, and discuss how novel technologies will deepen our understanding of this infection.",1664-3224 (Electronic) 1664-3224 (Linking),2020,,['10.3389/fimmu.2020.615402 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Haemophilus ducreyi', 'immune response', 'interactome', 'metabolome', 'skin']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Brothwell, Griesenauer, Chen and Spinola.']",,

In this work, we investigated the presence of T. p. pertenue and H. ducreyi DNA in skin ulcers in children living in yaws-endemic regions in Cameroon. Skin lesion swabs were collected from children presenting with yaws-suspected skin lesions during three outbreaks, two of which occurred in 2017 and one in 2019. DNA extracted from the swabs was used to amplify three target genes: the human beta2-microglobulin gene to confirm proper sample collection and DNA extraction, the polA gene, highly conserved among all subspecies of T. pallidum, and the hddA gene of H. ducreyi. A fourth target, the tprL gene was used to differentiate T. p. pertenue from the other agents of human treponematoses in polA-positive samples. A total of 112 samples were analysed in this study. One sample, negative for beta2-microglobulin, was excluded from further analysis. T. p. pertenue was only detected in the samples collected during the first 2017 outbreak (12/74, 16.2%). In contrast, H. ducreyi DNA could be amplified from samples from all three outbreaks (outbreak 1: 27/74, 36.5%; outbreak 2: 17/24, 70.8%; outbreak 3: 11/13, 84.6%). Our results show that H. ducreyi was more frequently associated to skin lesions in the examined children than T. p. pertenue, but also that yaws is still present in Cameroon. These findings strongly advocate for a continuous effort to determine the aetiology of ulcerative skin lesions during these recurring outbreaks, and to inform the planned mass treatment campaigns to eliminate yaws in Cameroon.",1935-2735 (Electronic) 1935-2727 (Linking),2021 Feb,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3757-7340', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0091-9792', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3889-7274', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2235-6038']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0009180 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-20-01295 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

Using mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin, a yaws eradication campaign on Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea reduced but failed to eradicate yaws; IU rates remained constant throughout the campaign. To identify potential etiologies of IU, we obtained swabs of CU lesions (n = 279) and of the skin of asymptomatic controls (AC; n = 233) from the Lihir Island cohort and characterized their microbiomes using a metagenomics approach. CU bacterial communities were less diverse than those of the AC. Using real-time multiplex PCR with pathogen-specific primers, we separated CU specimens into HD-positive (HD+), TP+, HD+TP+, and IU groups. Each CU subgroup formed a distinct bacterial community, defined by the species detected and/or the relative abundances of species within each group. Streptococcus pyogenes was the most abundant organism in IU (22.65%) and was enriched in IU compared to other ulcer groups. Follow-up samples (n = 31) were obtained from nonhealed ulcers; the average relative abundance of S. pyogenes was 30.11% in not improved ulcers and 0.88% in improved ulcers, suggesting that S. pyogenes in the not improved ulcers may be azithromycin resistant. Catonella morbi was enriched in IU that lacked S. pyogenes As some S. pyogenes and TP strains are macrolide resistant, penicillin may be the drug of choice for CU azithromycin treatment failures. Our study will aid in the design of diagnostic tests and selective therapies for CU.IMPORTANCE Cutaneous ulcers (CU) affect approximately 100,000 children in the tropics each year. While two-thirds of CU are caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue and Haemophilus ducreyi, the cause(s) of the remaining one-third is unknown. Given the failure of mass drug administration of azithromycin to eradicate CU, the World Health Organization recently proposed an integrated disease management strategy to control CU. Success of this strategy requires determining the unknown cause(s) of CU. By using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of swabs obtained from CU and the skin of asymptomatic children, we identified another possible cause of skin ulcers, Streptococcus pyogenes Although S. pyogenes is known to cause impetigo and cellulitis, this is the first report implicating the organism as a causal agent of CU.

Two leading models of this process have been put forth: the hybrid barrel model, which claims that a lateral gate in BamA's beta-barrel can serve as a template for incoming OMPs, and the passive model, which claims that a thinned membrane near the lateral gate of BamA accelerates spontaneous OMP insertion. To examine the key elements of these two models, we have carried out 45.5 mus of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of BamA with and without POTRA domains from Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, together with BamA's homolog, TamA from E. coli, in their native, species-specific outer membranes. In these equilibrium simulations, we consistently observe membrane thinning near the lateral gate for all proteins. We also see occasional spontaneous lateral gate opening and sliding of the beta-strands at the gate interface for N. gonorrhoeae, indicating that the gate is dynamic. An additional 14 mus of free-energy calculations shows that the energy necessary to open the lateral gate in BamA/TamA varies by species, but is always lower than the Omp85 homolog, FhaC. Our combined results suggest OMP insertion utilizes aspects of both the hybrid barrel and passive models.",1553-7358 (Electronic) 1553-734X (Linking),2020 Oct,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2217-1233', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1510-7842']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008355 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-20-01208 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,"['0 (Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins)', '0 (BamA protein, E coli)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)']","['*Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', '*Cell Membrane/chemistry/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Protein Conformation, beta-Strand', 'Protein Folding']"

World Health Organization (WHO) aims at total eradication of this disease through mass treatment of suspected cases followed by an intensive follow-up program. However, effective diagnosis is pivotal in the successful implementation of this control program. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique offers a wider range of differentiation of pathogens including those isolated from chronic skin ulcers with similar characteristics such as Haemophilus ducreyi (H. ducreyi). We have developed a RPA assay for the simultaneous detection of Treponema pallidum (T. pallidum) and H. ducreyi (TPHD-RPA). The assay demonstrated no cross-reaction with other pathogens and enable detection of T. pallidum and H. ducreyi within 15 min at 42 degrees C. The RPA assay was validated with 49 clinical samples from individuals confirmed to have yaws by serological tests. Comparing the developed assay with commercial multiplex real-time PCR, the assay demonstrated 94% and 95% sensitivity for T. pallidum and H. ducreyi, respectively and 100% specificity. This simple novel TPHD-RPA assay enables the rapid detection of both T. pallidum and H. ducreyi in yaws-like lesions.

HiMtsZ belongs to a group of structurally and spectroscopically uncharacterized S/N-oxide reductases, all of which are found in bacterial pathogens. Here, we have solved the crystal structure of HiMtsZ, which reveals that the HiMtsZ substrate-binding site encompasses a previously unrecognized part that accommodates the MetSO side chain via interaction with His182 and Arg166. Charge and amino acid composition of this side-chain binding region vary and, as indicated by electrochemical, kinetic and docking studies, could explain the diverse substrate specificity seen in the closely related enzymes of this type. The HiMtsZ Mo active site has an underlying structural flexibility, where dissociation of the central Ser187 ligand affected catalysis at low pH. Unexpectedly, the two main HiMtsZ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) species resembled not only a related DMSO reductase but also a structurally unrelated nitrate reductase that possesses an Asp-Mo ligand. This suggests that contrary to current views, the geometry of the Mo center and its primary ligands, rather than the specific amino acid environment, is the main determinant of the EPR properties of mononuclear Mo-enzymes. The flexibility in the electronic structure of the Mo centers is also apparent in two of three HiMtsZ EPR-active Mo(V) species being catalytically incompetent off-pathway forms that could not be fully oxidized.",1083-351X (Electronic) 0021-9258 (Linking),2021 Apr 19,,"['S0021-9258(21)00461-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100672 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['Haemophilus influenzae', 'electrochemistry', 'electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR )', 'enzyme kinetics', 'enzyme specificity', 'enzyme structure', 'methionine sulfoxide', 'molybdenum']",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Defective macrophage phagocytosis in COPD drives inflammation, but how defective macrophage function contributes to exacerbations is not clear. This study investigated the association between macrophage phagocytosis and exacerbation frequency, LABC and clinical parameters. METHODS: Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were generated from 92 stable COPD patients, and at the onset of exacerbation in 39 patients. Macrophages were exposed to fluorescently labelled Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae for 4 h, then phagocytosis measured by fluorimetry and cytokine release by ELISA. Sputum bacterial colonisation was measured by PCR. RESULTS: Phagocytosis of H. influenzae was negatively correlated with exacerbation frequency (r = 0.440, p < 0.01), and was significantly reduced in frequent vs. infrequent exacerbators (1.9 x 10(3) RFU vs. 2.5 x 10(3) RFU, p < 0.01). There was no correlation for S. pneumoniae. There was no association between phagocytosis of either bacteria with age, lung function, smoking history or treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, or long-acting bronchodilators. Phagocytosis was not altered during an exacerbation, or in the 2 weeks post-exacerbation. In response to phagocytosis, MDM from exacerbating patients showed increased release of CXCL-8 (p < 0.001) and TNFalpha (p < 0.01) compared to stable state.

METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by microdilution. Fifty-five MDR strains were subjected to WGS and were phylogenetically compared with all the available H. parainfluenzae genomes from the NCBI database. The identification of the capsular bexA gene was performed by PCR in 266 non-MDR strains. RESULTS: In 31 of the 42 ampicillin-resistant strains, blaTEM-1 located within Tn3 was identified. beta-Lactamase-negative cefuroxime-resistant strains (n = 12) presented PBP3 substitutions. The catS gene (n = 14), the tet(M)-MEGA element (n = 18) and FolA substitutions (I95L and F154V/S) (n = 41) were associated with resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline plus macrolides, and co-trimoxazole, respectively. Thirty-seven isolates had a Tn10 harbouring tet(B)/(C)/(D)/(R) genes with (n = 15) or without (n = 22) catA2. Putative transposons (Tn7076-Tn7079), including aminoglycoside and co-trimoxazole resistance genes, were identified in 10 strains (18.2%).

METHODS: Sixty-eight young patients with obesity were stratified for percentile distribution of MS abnormalities. A MS risk score was defined as low, medium, and high MS risk. High WBCs were defined as a count >/= 7.0 10(3)/microL; severe obesity as body mass index Z-score >/= 2 standard deviations; IR as homeostatic assessment model algorithm of IR (HOMA) >/= 3.7. Stool samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA-based metagenomics. RESULTS: We found reduced bacterial richness of fecal microbiota in patients with IR and high diastolic blood pressure (BP). Distinct microbial markers were associated to high BP (Clostridium and Clostridiaceae), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Lachnospiraceae, Gemellaceae, Turicibacter), and high MS risk (Coriobacteriaceae), WBCs (Bacteroides caccae, Gemellaceae), severe obesity (Lachnospiraceae), and impaired glucose tolerance (Bacteroides ovatus and Enterobacteriaceae).

We assessed the composition of the asthmatic airways microbiome in asthma patients taking low and high dose ICS and the stability of the microbiome over a 2 week period. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 55 individuals with asthma. Of these, 22 were on low-dose ICS and 33 on high-dose ICS (16 on budesonide, 17 on fluticasone propionate). Sputum from each subject underwent DNA extraction, amplification and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial component of the microbiome. 19 subjects returned for further sputum induction after 24 h and 2 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 5,615,037 sequencing reads revealed 167 bacterial taxa in the asthmatic airway samples, with the most abundant being Streptococcus spp. No significant differences in sputum bacterial load or overall community composition were seen between the low- and high-dose ICS groups. However, Streptococcus spp. showed significantly higher relative abundance in subjects taking low-dose ICS (p = 0.002). Haemophilus parainfluenzae was significantly more abundant in subjects on high-dose fluticasone propionate than those on high-dose budesonide (p = 0.047). There were no statistically significant changes in microbiota composition over a 2-week period. DISCUSSION: Whilst no significant differences were observed between the low- and high-dose ICS groups, increased abundance of the potential pathogen H. parainfluenzae was observed in patients taking high-dose fluticasone propionate compared to those taking high-dose budesonide. The microbiota were stable over fourteen days, providing novel evidence of the established community of bacteria in the asthmatic airways.

The human oral microbiome with its diverse habitats and abundant, relatively well-characterized microbial inhabitants presents an opportunity to investigate bacterial population structures at an ecosystem scale. RESULTS: Here, we employ a metapangenomic approach that combines public genomes with Human Microbiome Project (HMP) metagenomes to study the diversity of microbial residents of three oral habitats: tongue dorsum, buccal mucosa, and supragingival plaque. For two exemplar taxa, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and the genus Rothia, metapangenomes reveal distinct genomic groups based on shared genome content. H. parainfluenzae genomes separate into three distinct subgroups with differential abundance between oral habitats. Functional enrichment analyses identify an operon encoding oxaloacetate decarboxylase as diagnostic for the tongue-abundant subgroup. For the genus Rothia, grouping by shared genome content recapitulates species-level taxonomy and habitat preferences. However, while most R. mucilaginosa are restricted to the tongue as expected, two genomes represent a cryptic population of R. mucilaginosa in many buccal mucosa samples. For both H. parainfluenzae and the genus Rothia, we identify not only limitations in the ability of cultivated organisms to represent populations in their native environment, but also specifically which cultivar gene sequences are absent or ubiquitous. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insights into population structure and biogeography in the mouth and form specific hypotheses about habitat adaptation.

In the gene expression assays, the health-associated species mostly downregulated CD36, a gene that plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis, while P. gingivalis upregulated it.

Then, the imbalanced enzyme expression levels of L-lysine decarboxylase from Escherichia coli (EcCA), putrescine aminotransferase (KpcPA) and gamma-aminovaleraldehyde dehydrogenase (KpcPD) from Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the poor catalytic efficiency of KpcPA were identified as the rate-limiting bottlenecks. To this end, ribosome binding site regulation was employed to coordinate the enzyme molar ratio of EcCA:KpcPA:KpcPD at approximately 4:8:7 (the optimum ratio obtained in vitro), and volume scanning and hydrophobicity scanning were applied to increase KpcPA activity toward cadaverine from 15.89 +/- 0.52 to 75.87 +/- 1.51 U.mg(-1). Furthermore, the extracellular accumulation of 5-aminovalerate (5AVA) was considerably reduced by overexpressing gabP encoding the 5AVA importer. Combining these strategies into the engineered strain Glu-02, 77.62 g/L glutarate, the highest titer by E. coli to date, was produced from 100 g/L L-lysine in 42 h, with a yield and productivity of 0.78 g/g L-lysine and 1.85 g/L/h, respectively, at a 5-L scale. The results presented here provide a novel and potential enzymatic process at industrial-scale to produce glutarate from cheaper amino acids.

METHODS: 165 non-duplicate non-consecutive isolates of K. pneumoniae and E. coli were collected from hospitalized patients admitted to Iran's tertiary care hospitals from September 2016 to August 2018. The isolates were cultured from different clinical specimens, including wound, urine, blood, and tracheal aspirates. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion and microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) genes, carbapenemase genes, as well as fosfomycin resistance genes, and colistin resistance genes was also examined by PCR-sequencing. The ability of biofilm formation was assessed with crystal violet staining method. The expression of colistin resistance genes were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis to evaluate the association between gene upregulation and colistin resistance. Genotyping was performed using the multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST). RESULTS: Colistin and tigecycline were the most effective antimicrobial agents with 90.3% and 82.4% susceptibility. Notably, 16 (9.7%) isolates showed resistance to colistin. Overall, 33 (20%), 31 (18.8%), and 95 (57.6%) isolates were categorized as strong, moderate, and weak biofilm-producer, respectively.

In this respect, recent studies have proposed bacteriophage (phage) therapy as a potential alternative against MDR Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) because the resistance mechanism of phages differs from that of antibiotics and few side effects have been reported for them. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis are the most common uropathogenic bacteria against which phage therapy has been used. Phages, in addition to lysing bacterial pathogens, can prevent the formation of biofilms. Besides, by inducing or producing polysaccharide depolymerase, phages can easily penetrate into deeper layers of the biofilm and degrade it. Notably, phage therapy has shown good results in inhibiting multiple-species biofilm and this may be an efficient weapon against catheter-associated UTI. However, the narrow range of hosts limits the use of phage therapy. Therefore, the use of phage cocktail and combination therapy can form a highly attractive strategy. However, despite the positive use of these treatments, various studies have reported phage-resistant strains, indicating that phage-host interactions are more complicated and need further research. Furthermore, these investigations are limited and further clinical trials are required to make this treatment widely available for human use.

METHODS: Between 2007 and 2018, a total of 974 genital ulcer specimens with no previously identified sexually transmitted (STI) pathogens were selected from STI aetiological surveys conducted in all nine provinces of South Africa. Giemsa-stained ulcer smears from the same participants had previously been routinely analysed for the presence of typical Donovan bodies within large mononuclear cells. A Klebsiella screening assay targeting the phoE (phosphate porin) gene was used in combination with restriction digest analysis and sequencing to confirm the presence of K. granulomatis. RESULTS: The Klebsiella screening assay tested positive in 19/974 (2.0%) genital ulcer specimens.

GUD aetiological studies have been conducted in Johannesburg since 2007. We report on GUD pathogen prevalence, sero-prevalence of STI co-infections and aetiological trends among GUD patients presenting to a community-based primary healthcare facility in Johannesburg over a 9-year period. METHODS AND FINDINGS: GUD surveys were conducted from January to April each year. Consecutive genital ulcers were sampled from consenting adults. Swab-extracted DNA was tested by multiplex real-time PCR assays for herpes simplex virus (HSV), Treponema pallidum (TP), Haemophilus ducreyi (HD) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). HSV-positive DNA extracts were further subtyped into HSV-1 and HSV-2 using a commercial PCR assay; CT-positive extracts were tested with an in-house PCR assay specific for serovars L1-L3 (lymphogranuloma venereum). Sera were tested for HIV, HSV-2, and syphilis co-infections. Giemsa-stained ulcer smears were screened for Klebsiella granulomatis by microscopy. Data were analysed with STATATM version 14. Of 771 GUD specimens, 503 (65.2%) had a detectable pathogen: HSV 468 (60.7%); TP 30 (3.9%); CT L1-3 7 (0.9%); HD 4 (0.5%). No aetiological agents were detected in 270 (34.8%) ulcer specimens. Seroprevalence rates were as follows: HIV 61.7%; HSV-2 80.2% and syphilis 5.8%. There was a strong association between GUD pathogen detection and HIV seropositivity (p < 0.001); 68% of cases caused by HSV were co-infected with HIV.

The AgNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, dye degradation, blood anticoagulation, and blood clot dissolution (thrombolytic) activities. The crystalline polydispersed AgNPs with size range of 12.5-95.55 nm absorbed maximally at 428 nm and showed anisotropic structures of sphere, triangle, hexagon, rod, and rhombus. The FTIR data showed prominent peaks at 3426 and 1641 cm(-1), which indicate the involvement of phenolics compounds and proteins in the synthesis of AgNPs. The prominence of Ag in the EDX spectra showed that indeed, AgNPs were formed. The AgNPs showed potent antibacterial activities (12-35 mm) against three multi-drug strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella granulomatis. While the growth of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger was completely suppressed, the AgNPs produced growth inhibition of 75.61 % against Aspergillus fumigatus at 100 microg/ml.

This work aims to identify the determinants of resistance produced by Gram-negative bacteria in the influent and effluent of two WWTPs in Portugal. A total of 96 wastewater samples were obtained between 2016 and 2019. The numbers of total aerobic and fecal contamination bacteria were evaluated, and genomic features were searched by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Enterobacteriaceae corresponded to 78.6% (n = 161) of the 205 isolates identified by 16sRNA. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia spp. (57.1%, n = 117), followed by Aeromonas spp. (16.1%, n = 33) and Klebsiella spp. (12.7%, n = 26). The remaining 29 isolates (14.1%) were distributed across 10 different genera. Among the 183 resistant genes detected, 54 isolates produced extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), of which blaCTX-M-15 was predominant (37 isolates; 68.5%). A KPC-3 carbapenemase-producing K. oxytoca was identified (n = 1), with blaKPC-3 included in a transposon Tn4401 isoform b. A higher number of virulence genes (VG) (19 genes) was found in the E. coli 5301 (O25b-ST131-B2) isolate compared with a commensal E. coli 5281 (O25b-ST410-A) (six genes). Both shared five VG [Enterobactin; Aerobactin, CFA/1 (clade alpha); Type1 (clade gamma1); Type IV].

The aim of this study was to describe the phenotypic and molecular characterization of OXA-48-producing K. oxytoca isolates that caused an outbreak in a hospital in Tunisia. METHODS: Nineteen OXA-48-producing K. oxytoca were isolated from 2013 to 2016 in the University Hospital Farhat Hached, Sousse, Tunisia. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution. Carbapenemase activity was investigated using the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM). Phenotypic tests were also carried out to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. PCR was used to test for the presence of carbapenemase genes (blaIMP, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaSPM, blaAIM, blaDIM, blaGIM, blaSIM, blaKPC, blaBIC and blaOXA-48). Genetic relatedness among isolates was investigated using rep-PCR. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in three representative isolates. RESULTS: mCIM was positive in all isolates. None of the isolates presented an ESBL phenotype. All strains were susceptible to cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, meropenem, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and colistin, and resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, ertapenem, ticarcillin and ampicillin-sulbactam. All isolates presented the blaOXA-48 gene located in a ca. 63 kb IncL plasmid, which carried no additional resistance genes. They belonged to the new ST220. CONCLUSION: Isolates from this study did not co-express an ESBL, which could complicate their detection in clinical laboratories.

METHODS: A total of 839 individual rectal swabs from pigs on 164 farms and 271 faecal samples of humans working on pig farms and persons living in the same household in Khon Kaen, Thailand were screened for gut colonization by KP. Genomic sequences were investigated for antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Phylogenetic analyses were performed in addition to comparison with isolates from previous studies from Thailand. RESULTS: KP was detected in approximately 50% of pig and human samples. In total, 253 KP isolates were obtained: 39% from pigs, 34% from farmers and 26% from individuals living on the same farm but without animal contact. MLST revealed high genetic diversity with 196 different STs distributed over four phylogroups (Kp1 to Kp4). Low prevalence of ESBL-KP (7.5%) and colistin-resistant KP (3.2%) was observed among pigs and humans. Remarkably, four convergent MDR and hypervirulent strains were observed: one from pigs (ST290) and three from humans [ST35, ST3415 (strain 90CP1), ST17 (strain 90CM2)]. Sharing of KP clones among pigs and humans was identified for some STs including ST4788, ST661, ST3541 and ST29.

Given that there is currently no all-round solution to eliminate colonization with MDR bacteria, it is particularly important to understand the dynamic process of colonization to aid the development of novel decolonization strategies. The aim of our present study was to perform metataxonomic analyses of gut microbiota dynamics during colonization with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ECKP) strain in mice; additionally, to ascertain the effects of antibiotic administration (ampicillin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin) on the establishment and elimination of ECKP intestinal colonization. We have found that the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were most dominant in all of the treatment groups; however, Bacteroidetes was more common in the groups treated with antibiotics compared to the control group. Significant differences were observed among the different antibiotic-treated groups in beta but not alpha diversity, implying that the difference is the relative abundance of some bacterial community members. Bacteria from the Lachnospiraceae family (including Agathobacter, Anaerostipes, Lachnoclostridium 11308, Lachnospiraceae UCG-004, Lachnospiraceae NK3A20 group 11318, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group 11319, Roseburia, and Tyzzerella) showed an inverse relationship with the carriage rate of the ECKP strain, whereas members of Enterobacteriaceae and the ECKP strain have shown a correlational relationship. Our results suggest that the composition of the microbial community plays a primary role in the MDR-colonization rate, whereas the antibiotic susceptibility of individual MDR strains affects this process to a lesser extent. Distinct bacterial families have associated into microbial clusters, collecting taxonomically close species to produce survival benefits in the gut. These associations do not develop at random, as they may be attributed to the presence of specific metabolomic networks. A new concept should be introduced in designing future endeavors for MDR decolonization, supplemented by knowledge of the composition of the host bacterial community and the identification of bacterial clusters capable of suppressing or enhancing the invader species.",2079-6382 (Print) 2079-6382 (Linking),2021 Mar 7,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1307-7387', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9585-8397', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6022-4792']","['antibiotics10030268 [pii]', '10.3390/antibiotics10030268 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'MDR', 'antibiotic-induced microbiota alteration', 'colonization', 'decolonization', 'gut microbiota', 'metataxonomic analysis', 'microbiota-cluster']",,,

The challenges posed by these hypermucoviscous strains of K. pneumoniae with regard to their optimal treatment, management, and control policies are yet to be answered. We studied a series of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae ST5235 isolates with resistance to carbapenems and polymyxins causing neonatal sepsis in a tertiary care hospital in India. A total of 9 K. pneumoniae isolates from 9 cases of neonatal sepsis were studied with respect to their clinical relevance, antimicrobial susceptibility profile, presence of extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) production, and responsible genes, carbapenemases (classes A, B, and D), and aminoglycoside-resistant genes. Hypervirulence genes encoding hypermucoid nature, iron uptake, and siderophores were detected by multiplex PCR. The plasmid profile was studied by replicon typing. Isolates were typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR to study the sequence types (STs) and clonal relation, respectively. The neonates in the studied cases had history of pre-maturity or low birth weight with maternal complications. All the cases were empirically treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin followed by imipenem/meropenem and vancomycin and polymyxin B as a last resort. However, all the neonates finally succumbed to the condition (100%). The studied isolates were XDR including resistance to polymyxins harboring multiple ESBL genes and carbapenemase genes (bla NDM and bla OXA-48). Hypervirulence genes were present in various combinations with rmpA/A2 genes present in all the isolates. IncFI plasmids were detected in these isolates. All belonged to ST5235.

Methods: Consumption of 3GCs, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems in association with ertapenem and fluoroquinolone-resistant KP isolates, were analyzed in 21 months by autoregressive integrated moving average models. A follow-up analysis was performed 5 years later. Results: Consumption of 3GCs decreased significantly during the postintervention period. Their restriction was associated with a decrease in ertapenem-resistant KP isolates by 17.5%. Fluoroquinolone, 3GCs, and carbapenem use did not significantly predict the percentage of ertapenem-resistant KP isolates. Fluoroquinolone, but not cephalosporin use, significantly predicted the percentage of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, with an increase of 1 defined daily dose (DDD) of fluoroquinolone/100 occupied bed-days (OBDs) corresponding to a 0.32% increase of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates (p = 0.008).

A total of 770 clinical samples were collected and identified using the conventional biochemical tests following the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed using the standardized Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. The screening test for ESBL producers was performed as recommended by the CLSI and the confirmatory test was performed phenotypically using the E-test. RESULTS: Out of the 92 isolates, 84 (91.3%) were multidrug-resistant, and 47 (51.1%) were found to be potential ESBL producers. Of these, 16 isolates were confirmed ESBL producers by the E-test. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the predominant isolates and were also the major ESBL producers. Besides polymyxin B (100% sensitive), meropenem and imipenem showed high efficacy against the ESBL producers. CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistance was very high; however, ESBL production was low.

C/T is of particular importance as an agent for the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. The current study summarizes 2018-2019 data from the United States on lower respiratory tract isolates of Gram-negative bacilli from the SMART global surveillance program. The CLSI reference broth microdilution method was used to determine in vitro susceptibility of C/T and comparators against isolates of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales. RESULTS: C/T inhibited 96.0% of P. aeruginosa (n = 1237) at its susceptible MIC breakpoint (</=4 mug/ml), including > 85% of meropenem-nonsusceptible and piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T)-nonsusceptible isolates and 76.2% of MDR isolates.

We determined the genetic relationships among carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKp) strains causing infections in hospitalized pets in a veterinary clinic and those found in the environment. METHODS: WGS was performed with both the Illumina and Nanopore platforms. Searches of genetic features were performed using several databases and bioinformatics tools, and phylogeny was assessed by whole-genome MLST (wgMLST) using SeqSphere and SNP calling with Snippy. RESULTS: WGS analysis of the CPKp strains identified all environmental and almost all animal strains as the high-risk clone ST11, with the exception of two strains that belonged to ST307. All CPKp belonged to novel complex types (CTs) and carried a conjugative 63 kb IncL plasmid encoding the carbapenemase gene blaOXA-48, yersiniabactin and other virulence factors. Although all CPKp ST11 strains carried additional similar IncR plasmids harbouring multiple antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), such as the plasmid-mediated blaDHA-1 AmpC gene, some structural variations were observed. The two ST307 strains carried identical 156 kb MDR IncFIB(K) plasmids with several ARGs, including the blaCTX-M-15 ESBL gene. Both wgMLST and cgSNP analysis confirmed that CPKp strains of the same ST were genetically highly related independent of the source of isolation.

In this study, we have performed a microbiological and genomic investigation of critical priority pathogens resistant to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and showing endophytic lifestyles in fresh vegetables sold in a country with high endemicity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). We report the isolation of international high-risk clones of CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli, belonging to clonal complexes CC38 and CC648, and Klebsiella pneumoniae of complex CC307 from macerated tissue of surface-sterilized leaves of spinach, cabbage, arugula, and lettuce. Regardless of species, all ESBL-positive isolates were able to endophytically colonize common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seedlings, showed resistance to acid pH, and had a multidrug-resistant (MDR) profile to clinically relevant antibiotics (i.e., broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones). Genomic analysis of CTX-M-producing endophytic Enterobacterales revealed a wide resistome (antibiotics, biocides, disinfectants, and pesticides) and virulome, and genes for endophytic fitness and for withstanding acidic conditions. Transferable IncFIB and IncHI2A plasmids carried bla CTX-M-15 genes and, additionally, an IncFIB plasmid (named pKP301cro) also harbored genes encoding resistance to heavy metals. These data support the hypothesis that fresh vegetables marketed for consumption can act as a figurative Trojan horse for the hidden spread of international clones of critical WHO priority pathogens producing ESBLs, and/or their resistance genes, to humans and other animals, which is a critical issue within a food safety and broader public and environmental health perspective.IMPORTANCE Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales are a leading cause of human and animal infections, being classified as critical priority pathogens by the World Health Organization. Epidemiological studies have shown that spread of ESBL-producing bacteria is not a problem restricted to hospitals, but also represents a growing problem involving environmental and food safety. In this regard, CTX-M-type beta-lactamases have become the most widely distributed and clinically relevant ESBLs worldwide. Here, we have investigated the occurrence and genomic features of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales in surface-sterilized fresh vegetables. We have uncovered that international high-risk clones of CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae harboring a wide resistome and virulome, carry additional genes for endophytic fitness and resistance to acidic conditions. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that these CTX-M-15-positive isolates are able to endophytically colonize plant tissues.

As the most important ingredient, salt has crucial effects on the bacterial community and volatile compounds of paocai. In order to reveal the effects of salt on the fermentation of paocai, the bacterial composition and volatile compounds were investigated by using high-throughput sequencing and GC-MS. RESULTS: The salt had no significant effects on the bacterial community at the phylum level. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes gradually decreased during the fermentation, while Firmicutes gradually increased as the dominant bacteria in the late stage of fermentation. At the genus level, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus gradually increased in relative abundance during the fermentation and became the dominant bacteria in paocai. High salt can contribute to the growth of Lactobacillus became the dominant genus in paocai. The salt concentration affected the profiles of volatile compounds in paocai after fermentation. A total of 42 volatile components were detected by GC-MS, among which phenols, aldehydes and nitriles were the main ones. High salt concentration will increase the content of volatile compounds, mainly aldehydes and alcohols, and improve the flavor of paocai. At the same time, the electronic tongue analysis also showed that high salt concentration had a great contribution to the flavor of paocai.

The gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing followed by absolute and relative quantitation analyses. Results: Nineteen genera were altered during glioma progression with the most dramatic changes in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. During glioma growth, Lactobacillus abundance decreased in the early stage (T1) and then gradually increased (T2, T3); Intestinimonas abundance exhibited a persistent increase; Anaerotruncus showed a transient increase (T2) and then a subsequent decrease (T3). Similar longitudinal changes in Intestinimonas and Anaerotruncus abundance were observed in TMZ-treated mice, but the decrease of Anaerotruncus at T3 in the TMZ-treated group was less than that in the vehicle-treated group. No significant change in Lactobacillus was observed after TMZ treatment. Additionally, compared to vehicle control, TMZ treatment led to an enrichment in Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium. Conclusion: Glioma development and progression altered the composition of gut microbiota. Induction of Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium as well as the prevention of the reduction in Anaerotruncus may contribute to the anti-tumor effect of TMZ. This study helps to reveal the association between levels of specific microbial species in the gut and the anti-tumor effect of TMZ.",1177-8881 (Electronic) 1177-8881 (Linking),2021,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5812-6624'],"['10.2147/DDDT.S298261 [doi]', '298261 [pii]']",['eng'],New Zealand,"['epigenetics', 'glioma', 'gut microbiota', 'temozolomide', 'tumor microenvironment']",['(c) 2021 Li et al.'],,

It is now well accepted that a ""healthy"" vaginal microbiome is dominated by Lactobacillus species. Disturbances in this microbial community can lead to several adverse outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease and bacterial vaginosis (BV), as well as increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, miscarriage, and preterm births. However, vaginal communities, especially those of women in the developing world, can be comprised of a diverse set of microorganisms in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. The implications of these diverse vaginal microbiomes for women's health remain poorly understood. Rhesus macaques are an excellent translational animal model to address these questions due to significant physiological and genetic homology with humans. In this study, we performed a longitudinal analysis of clinical and microbiome data from 16 reproductive-age female rhesus macaques. At both the taxonomic and functional levels, the rhesus macaque vaginal microbiome was most similar to that of women who harbor a diverse vaginal community associated with asymptomatic/symptomatic bacterial vaginosis. Specifically, rhesus macaque vaginal microbiomes harbored a diverse set of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, including Sneathia, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Mobiluncus Interestingly, some animals were transiently colonized by Lactobacillus and some with Gardnerella Our in-depth and comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of the model to understand the health implications of a diverse vaginal microbiome and test interventions for manipulating this community.IMPORTANCE It is widely accepted that the ""healthy"" vaginal microbiome of women in the developed world is dominated by Lactobacillus species.

The main cause of spontaneous PTB (sPTB) is the activation of an inflammatory response as a result of ascending genital tract infection. Despite various studies on the effects of the vaginal microbiome on PTB, a practical method for its clinical application has yet to be developed. METHOD OF STUDY: In this case-control study, 94 Korean pregnant women with PTB (n=38) and term birth (TB; n=56) were enrolled.

Dietary CG increased the jejunal weight (linear and quadratic terms, p < 0.05) but decreased the ileal weight (linearly, p < 0.05). There was mostly statistical interaction between dietary CG and specific activity of intestinal digestive enzymes with similar patterns for dietary CG treatments (p < 0.05). A positive linear correlation was observed with in vitro protein digestibility by using the crude enzyme extract from dietary CG supplementation. Dietary CG decreased the caecal Escherichia coli population while the Lactobacillus spp.: E. coli ratio increased (quadratic fit, p < 0.05). CG supplementation, on the other hand, significantly altered intestinal morphology by increasing the height of duodenal and ileal villi (linearly, p < 0.05). Also, duodenal antioxidant capacity observed via remaining reducing power improved linearly (p < 0.05). This suggests that CG, unlike garlic oils without encapsulation, may be a good candidate for feed supplementation in commercial egg production.

Different cell encapsulation methods exist, yielding shells with different interfacial-interactions with encapsulated, bacterial surfaces. However, the impact of interfacial-interactions on the protection offered by different shells is unclear and can vary for bacteria with different surface composition. Probiotic bacteria require protection against gastro-intestinal fluids and antibiotics. Here, we encapsulated two probiotic strains using ZIF-8 (zeolitic imidazolate framework) biomineralization (strong-interaction by coordinate-covalent bonding), alginate gelation (intermediate-interaction by hydrogen bonding) or protamine-assisted packing of SiO2 nanoparticles yielding a yolk-shell (weak-interaction across a void between shells and bacterial surfaces). The surface of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus was rich in protein, yielding a hydrophilic, positively-charged surface below and a negatively-charged one above pH 4.0. Probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis had a hydrophilic, uncharged surface, rich in polysaccharides with little proteins. Although amino groups are required for coordinate-covalent bonding of zinc and hydrogen bonding of alginate, both L. acidophilus and B. infantis could be encapsulated using ZIF-8 biomineralization and alginate gelation. Weakly, intermediately and strongly interacting shells all yielded porous shells. The strongly interacting ZIF-8 biomineralized shell made encapsulated bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics, presumably due to the cell wall damage already inflicted during Zif-8 biomineralization. Overall, weakly interacting yolk-shells and intermediately interacting alginate gels protected best and maintained probiotic activity of encapsulated bacteria. The impact of interfacial-interactions between shells and encapsulated bacteria on different aspect of protection described here, contributes to the further development of effective surface-engineered shells and its application for protecting bacteria.",2040-3372 (Electronic) 2040-3364 (Linking),2021 Apr 21,,['10.1039/d0nr09204e [doi]'],['eng'],England,,,,

Nevertheless, antibiotics are known to disrupt the hindgut microbiota, affecting the fibrolytic activity of bacteria and the intestinal immune balance, leading to diseases. This in vivo study used a general and comprehensive approach for characterizing the hindgut ecosystem of 9 healthy horses over 28 days in response to a 5-day challenge with oral trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (TMS), with a special emphasis on microbial fibrolytic activity and the host immune response. Horses were supplemented with two doses of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Ligilactobacillus salivarius (formerly L. salivarius), and Bifidobacterium lactis blend or a placebo in a 3 x 3 Latin square design. Changes in fecal microbiota were investigated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Clostridioides difficile was quantified in feces using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Anaerobic microbiological culture was used to enumerate functional bacterial groups (cellulolytic, amylolytic, and lactic acid-utilizing). The environmental dimensions were assessed by measuring the concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and lactic acid using biochemical methods, and changes in pH and dry matter weight. Systemic and local inflammation was evaluated by determination of cytokine and immunoglobulin (Ig)A concentrations in the serum and secretory IgA (SIgA) concentrations in the feces using immuno-enzymatic methods. Oral TMS treatment strongly altered the whole hindgut ecosystem by 2 days after the first administration. Bacterial diversity decreased in proportion to the relative abundance of fibrolytic genera, which coincided with the decrease in the concentration of cellulolytic bacteria. At the same time, the composition of microbiota members was reorganized in terms of relative abundances, probably to support the alteration in fibrolysis.

However, the added probiotics must overcome the challenges of processing and storage conditions and the harsh gastrointestinal environment. The study aimed to overcome these challenges using two different formulations of cocoa powder as alternative encapsulants along with Na-alginate (A1 ) and Na-alginate and fructooligosaccharides (A2 ). Seven different probiotic strains were encapsulated individually using the new formulations and viabilities of these encapsulated probiotics were assessed prior to and after they were added to chocolates. The highest achieved encapsulation efficiencies were 93.40% for formulation A1 (with Lactobacillus casei) and 95.36% for formulation A2 (with Lactobacillus acidophilus La5). The encapsulated probiotics with the new formulations maintained higher viability than the recommended therapeutic level (10(7) colony forming unit [CFU]/g) for up to 180 and 120 days of storage at 4 and 25 degrees C, respectively. The tested encapsulants improved probiotics survival when subjected to thermal stress and maintained about 9.0 Logs CFU/g at 60 degrees C. Additionally, the viable numbers of probiotics in fortified chocolates showed higher than 7 Logs CFU/g after 90 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Both formulations exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) high survivability of probiotics (8.0 Logs CFU/g) during the in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. This study demonstrated that cocoa powder along with Na-alginate and FOS has the potential to be used as a probiotic encapsulating material, and chocolates could be an excellent carrier for the development of healthy probiotic chocolate products.

While sparse data are available on the affinity of EPS-milk protein interactions, structural information on BLG-EPS complexes, including the EPS binding sites, is completely lacking. Here, binding sites on BLG variant A (BLGA), for oligosaccharides prepared by mild acid hydrolysis of two EPS produced by Streptococcus thermophilus LY03 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus CNRZ 1187, respectively, are identified by NMR spectroscopy and supplemented by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and molecular docking of complexes. Evidence of two binding sites (site 1 and site 2) on the surface of BLGA is achieved for both oligosaccharides (LY03-OS and 1187-OS) through NMR chemical shift perturbations, revealing multivalency of BLGA for EPS. The affinities of LY03-OS and 1187-OS for BLGA gave K D values in the mM range obtained by both NMR (pH 2.65) and ITC (pH 4.0). Molecular docking suggested that the BLGA and EPS complexes depend on hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.

Probiotics like Lactobacillus may regulate the balance of the intestinal flora and play an active role in preventing and treating depression. Methods: Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice (n=32) were randomly and equally divided into a normal control group, a control + Lac group, a model group, and a model + Lac group. The model and model + Lac groups were intraperitoneally injected with 1.2 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide for 7 days, and the behavior of the mice was assessed 24 hours later. The normal and model groups received intragastric administration of saline daily, while the control + Lac and model + Lac groups were given 10(9) cfu Lac intragastrically daily for 7 days. The inhibitory effect of Lac and its fermentation products on depression-related bacteria were examined in vitro. Results: Lac effectively inhibited the production of depression-like behaviors in mice. The expression levels of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and E-cadherin in the small intestine in the model group were significantly decreased, but Lac abrogated this effect. Overactivation of microglia and decreased expression of dopamine transporter (DAT) in brain tissues, which are closely related to depression, were also abrogated by Lac treatment. Furthermore, the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nod-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3), as well as the level of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) in the intestine and brain, were all significantly increased; however, these effects were subsequently abrogated by Lac.

The present study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with Lactobacillus delbrueckii (LAB) on intestinal integrity and oxidative damage in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged piglets. A total of 36 crossbred weaned piglets (Duroc x Landrace x Large Yorkshire) were randomly divided into three groups: (1) non-challenged controls (CON), (2) LPS-challenged controls (LPS), and (3) 0.2% LAB (2.01 x 10(10) CFU/g) + LPS treatment (LAB + LPS). On the 29th day of the experiment, the LPS and CON groups were injected intraperitoneally with LPS and saline at 100 ug/kg body weight, respectively. The results show that the LPS-induced elevation of the serum diamine oxidase (DAO) level and small intestinal crypt depth (CD) were reversed by the dietary addition of LAB, which also markedly increased the ileal expression of tight junction proteins (occludin, ZO-1, and claudin-1) in the LPS-challenged piglets. Furthermore, LAB supplementation normalized other LPS-induced changes, such as by decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) in both the serum and intestinal mucosa and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the jejunal mucosa, increasing glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in both the serum and intestinal mucosa, and increasing glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the jejunal mucosa. LAB also activated Toll-like receptor (TLR)-Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2) signaling pathways in the intestine, suggesting that it plays a vital role in the ameliorative antioxidant capacity of weaned piglets.

Methods: Vasculitis was induced via Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE) injection in 5-week-old male mice. Groups of mice were injected with LCWE alone, LCWE and IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra, or saline for controls. Upper heart tissue was assessed by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis.

Results: STAT3 was highly expressed and phosphorylated in cardiac tissue of LCWE-injected mice, and reduced following anakinra treatment. Il6 and Stat3 gene expression was enhanced in abdominal aorta of LCWE-injected mice and reduced with Anakinra treatment. IL-6 serum levels were enhanced in LCWE-injected mice and normalized by anakinra. However, neither inhibition of STAT3 nor blockade of IL-6 altered disease development.

Male BALB/c mice (7-8 weeks, weight 20-24 g) were treated with amounts of Lact. casei IMV B-7280 strain: 5 x 10(6), 5 x 10(8), or 5 x 10(9) CFU/animal once per day during 7 days, or in the amount of 1 x 10(10) CFU/animal once per day during 3 days (most of the proposed probiotic doses for humans-from 10(8) to 10(9) CFU) and monitored during 14 days. Blood tests and serum biochemistry were conducted; the cecal content from mice of the experimental and control groups were freshly collected and analyzed. At the end of the experiments (15th day), the presence of LAB in the heart, liver, kidney, and mesenteric lymph nodes and peripheral blood was determined; histology of the brain, liver, heart, fragments of the small and large intestine, and mesenteric lymph nodes was conducted. Survival rate of BALB/c mice treated with Lact. casei IMV B-7280 strain in different concentrations in toxicity experiments during 14 days was 100%. We observed no signs of toxicity as changes in gait, lethargy, sleep, somatomotor activity as well as changes in fur, eyes, skin and mucous membranes, tremors, behavior pattern, convulsions, salivation, diarrhea, and local injuries in mice from all experimental groups. After administration of probiotic strain, the number of opportunistic bacteria in cecal contents, such as Staphylococcus spp., Candida spp., Pseudomonas spp., and total aerobic and optionally anaerobic bacteria decreased compared to controls; the population of beneficial bacteria such as lactobacilli increased in cecal contents of these mice. LAB were not detected in the peripheral blood, heart, liver, kidneys, and mesenteric lymph nodes after administration of this strain to intact mice. Lact. casei IMV B-7280 strain is safe at dose up to 10(10) CFU/animal during 3- and 7-day oral administration to mice and has a positive effect on the gut microbiota composition; it could be potentially considered as safe probiotic for humans.",1867-1314 (Electronic) 1867-1306 (Linking),2021 Apr 20,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3148-9884'],"['10.1007/s12602-021-09789-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12602-021-09789-1 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,"['In vivo', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lactobacillus casei IMV B-7280', 'Mouse model', 'Probiotic strain', 'Safety']",,,

However, the clinical evidence is absent. The objective is to investigate the effect of adjunctive Lactobacillus casei on tuberculosis-drug-induced liver injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: A post hoc analysis was conducted for a previous randomized controlled trial. The trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR-IOR-17013210). 429 patients were allocated to receive standard tuberculosis therapy alone (control group), or together with 1 x 10(10) colony-forming units (CFU) per day (low-dose group), or 2 x 10(10) CFU per day of L. casei (high-dose group) during tuberculosis treatment. The L. casei supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of the abnormal increase of cholestasis-related liver indices including alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.024) and bilirubin (p = 0.013). Plasma lipopolysaccharide (p = 0.02), intestinal permeability biomarkers including zonula occludens-1 (p = 0.001) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (p = 0.002) were significantly reduced. The gut microbiota composition was dramatically altered with a reduction of Bacteroidetes (p<0.001) and a corresponding increase of Actinobacteria (p<0.001) and Firmicutes (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: L. casei supplementation is beneficial for suppressing abnormally elevated cholestasis-related liver indices during tuberculosis treatment, which may be related to its modification on blood lipopolysaccharide, intestinal barrier function and gut microbiota.

At first, the antioxidant properties and degree of hydrolysis (DH) of GPH were determined using the microbial protease enzymes (alcalase and flavourzyme), the results showed that alcalase enzyme can produce GPH with higher DH and antioxidant properties (p < .05). Also, increasing the hydrolysis time had a positive effect on these properties (p < .05). The DH, free radical scavenging DPPH, and ferric reducing power for GPH by alcalase at 30 min was 21.51%, 88.68%, and 0.33 mumol ferrous/ g, respectively. Therefore, this treatment was used for further experiments. In the next part, the mentioned GPH was added to the stirred yogurt with three concentrations (0.5, 1.5, and 1.5%) and physicochemical properties and viability of Lactobacillus casei and sensory properties were measured during 15 days of storage. The results showed that the GPH treatment had higher pH, viscosity, and texture firmness and less acidity and syneresis compared with the control sample (p < .05). Also, in these samples, the decreasing trend of L. casei viability was slower than the control treatment during the storage period (p < .05). In most parameters, better results were observed with increasing the concentration GPH and all the treatments were acceptable in terms of sensory properties. Therefore, by producing yogurt containing GPH, a new functional food can be provided for consumers of dairy products, which in addition to the desired taste, good nutritional properties can be also achieved from its consumption.",2048-7177 (Print) 2048-7177 (Linking),2021 Apr,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6383-2814'],"['10.1002/fsn3.2188 [doi]', 'FSN32188 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,"['alcalase', 'antioxidant', 'bioactive peptides', 'flavourzyme', 'physicochemical', 'probiotic yogurt']","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Principal component analysis, heatmap plots, and Spearman correlation results showed that Zhang alone had a greater effect on volatile and nonvolatile metabolomic profiles than M8 alone. The combination of Zhang and M8 had additive effects on the production of metabolites. For volatile metabolites, the levels of acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin, and acetic acid were higher for the combination of Zhang and M8 compared with either single probiotic culture.

During the last years, a series of vectors based on promiscuous replicons of the pMV158 family have been developed for their employment in a variety of Gram-positive bacteria and proved to be useful for all above applications in lactic acid bacteria. A proper use of the plasmid vectors requires detailed knowledge of their main replicative features under the changing growth conditions of the studied bacteria, such as the acidification of the culture medium by lactic acid production. Initiation of pMV158 rolling-circle replication is catalyzed by the plasmid-encoded RepB protein, which performs a sequence-specific cleavage on one of the parental DNA strands and, as demonstrated in this work, establishes a covalent bond with the 5'-P end generated in the DNA. This covalent adduct must last until the leading-strand termination stage, where a new cleavage on the regenerated nick site and a subsequent strand-transfer reaction result in rejoining of the ends of the cleaved parental strand, whereas hydrolysis of the newly-generated adduct would release the protein from a nicked double-stranded DNA plasmid form. We have analyzed here the effect of pH on the different in vitro reactions catalyzed by RepB and on the in vivo replication ability of plasmid pMV158. We show that acidic pH greatly impairs the catalytic activity of the protein and reduces hydrolysis of the covalent RepB-DNA adduct, as expected for the nucleophilic nature of these reactions. Conversely, the ability of pMV158 to replicate in vivo, as monitored by the copy number and segregational stability of the plasmid in Lactococcus lactis, remains almost intact at extracellular pHs ranging from 7.0 to 5.0, and a significant reduction (by approximately 50%) in the plasmid copy number per chromosome equivalent is only observed at pH 4.5. Moreover, the RepB to pMV158 molar ratio is increased at pH 4.5, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that operate in vivo to allow pMV158 replication at pH values that severely disturb the catalytic activity of the initiator protein.",2296-889X (Print) 2296-889X (Linking),2021,,"['10.3389/fmolb.2021.634461 [doi]', '634461 [pii]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['covalent RepB-DNA adduct', 'endonuclease activity', 'nucleophilic attack', 'promiscuous plasmid pMV158', 'rolling circle replication (RCR)', 'strand-transfer activity']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Valdelvira, Bordanaba-Ruiseco, Martin-Huestamendia, Ruiz-Maso', 'and del Solar.']",,

CASE PRESENTATION: It is a 27-year-old male patient without history who presented the right hypochondrium pain over 10 days. The physical examination noted right hypochondrium pain and hepatomegally. The ultrasound showed hepatomegaly with liver abcess for the segments IV and V as well as VII and VIII measuring 13 x 8 cm and 7.6 x 4.3 cm respectively. A computed tomography (CT) revealed an abscess for segments IV and V and VI and VII measuring respectively 107 x 89 mm and 55 x 50 mm. He underwent a surgical drainage after a radiologic drainage and antibiotherapy failure with success. DISCUSSION: Liver abscesses are rare; affect men over 60 years with co-morbidities and those due to L. Lactis ssp lactis are exceptional. Their prevalence is 0.29-1.47% in series of autopsies and 0.008 to 0.16% in hospitalized patients. The most frequently found germs are gram-negative bacilli (40-60%) and anaerobic bacteria (40-50%). Ultrasound and CT scan make the diagnosis in 90% of cases and orients to the etiology. Percutaneous drainage is the first line for treatment, surgical drainage is reserved for percutaneous drainage failures. CONCLUSION: Liver abscess due to Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis is very rare. The clinic, diagnostic methods and treatment of this abscess are identical to other abscesses due to other etiologies. The antibiotics and percutaneous drainage of abscesses have improved the death rate from 40% to 10%-25%.",2210-2612 (Print) 2210-2612 (Linking),2021 Apr,,"['S2210-2612(21)00332-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijscr.2021.105831 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Lactococcus lactis spp lactis', 'Liver abcess', 'Liver abcess aetiologies']",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Consequently, novel vaccines are required to facilitate a reduction in Mtb morbidity and mortality. PilVax is a peptide delivery strategy for the generation of highly specific mucosal immune responses and is based on the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis that is used to express selected peptides engineered within the Streptococcus pyogenes M1T1 pilus, allowing for peptide amplification, stabilisation, and enhanced immunogenicity. In the present study, the dominant T cell epitope from the Mtb protein Ag85B was genetically engineered into the pilus backbone subunit and expressed on the surface of L. lactis. Western blot and flow cytometry confirmed formation of pilus containing the peptide DNA sequence. B cell responses in intranasally vaccinated mice were analysed by ELISA while T cell responses were analysed by flow cytometry. Serum titres of peptide specific IgG and IgA were detected, confirming vaccination produced antibodies against the cognate peptide. Peptide-specific IgA was also detected across several mucosal sites sampled. Peptide-specific CD4(+) T cells were detected at levels similar to those of mice immunised with BCG. PilVax immunisation resulted in an unexpected increase in the numbers of CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) (double negative, DN) T cells in the lungs of vaccinated mice. Analysis of cytokine production following stimulation with the cognate peptide showed the major cytokine producing cells to be CD4(+) T cells and DN T cells. This study provides insight into the antibody and peptide specific cellular immune responses generated by PilVax vaccination and demonstrates the suitability of this vaccine for conducting a protection study.",1440-1711 (Electronic) 0818-9641 (Linking),2021 Apr 18,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4802-7048', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9275-5042']",['10.1111/imcb.12462 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'PilVax', 'TB', 'peptide', 'vaccine']",['This article is protected by copyright.

To produce (R)-acetoin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, acetoin biosynthetic genes encoding alpha-acetolactate synthase (AlsS) and alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase (AlsD) from Bacillus subtilis and water-forming NADH oxidase (NoxE) from Lactococcus lactis were integrated into delta-sequences in JHY605 strain, where the production of ethanol, glycerol, and (R,R)-2,3-butanediol (BDO) was largely eliminated.

Ara1, Ypr1, and Ymr226c (named Ora1) were identified as (S)-alcohol-forming reductases, which can reduce (R)-acetoin to meso-2,3-BDO in vitro. However, only Ara1 and Ypr1 contributed to meso-2,3-BDO production in vivo.

The pool of c-di-AMP is fine-tuned through diadenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities, and direct binding of c-di-AMP to proteins and riboswitches allows the regulation of a broad spectrum of cellular processes. c-di-AMP has a significant impact on intrinsic beta-lactam antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive bacteria; however, the reason for this is currently unclear. In this work, genetic studies revealed that suppressor mutations that decrease the activity of the potassium (K(+)) importer KupB or the glutamine importer GlnPQ restore cefuroxime (CEF) resistance in diadenylate cyclase (cdaA) mutants of Lactococcus lactis Metabolite analyses showed that glutamine is imported by GlnPQ and then rapidly converted to glutamate, and GlnPQ mutations or c-di-AMP negatively affects the pools of the most abundant free amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) during growth. In a high-c-di-AMP mutant, GlnPQ activity could be increased by raising the internal K(+) level through the overexpression of a c-di-AMP-insensitive KupB variant. These results demonstrate that c-di-AMP reduces GlnPQ activity and, therefore, the level of the major free anions in L. lactis through its inhibition of K(+) import. Excessive ion accumulation in cdaA mutants results in greater spontaneous cell lysis under hypotonic conditions, while CEF-resistant suppressors exhibit reduced cell lysis and lower osmoresistance. This work demonstrates that the overaccumulation of major counter-ion osmolyte pools in c-di-AMP-defective mutants of L. lactis causes cefuroxime sensitivity.IMPORTANCE The bacterial second messenger cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a global regulator of potassium homeostasis and compatible solute uptake in many Gram-positive bacteria, making it essential for osmoregulation. The role that c-di-AMP plays in beta-lactam resistance, however, is unclear despite being first identified a decade ago. Here, we demonstrate that the overaccumulation of potassium or free amino acids leads to cefuroxime sensitivity in Lactococcus lactis mutants partially defective in c-di-AMP synthesis. It was shown that c-di-AMP negatively affects the levels of the most abundant free amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) in L. lactis Regulation of these major free anions was found to occur via the glutamine transporter GlnPQ, whose activity increased in response to intracellular potassium levels, which are under c-di-AMP control. Evidence is also presented showing that they are major osmolytes that enhance osmoresistance and cell lysis. The regulatory reach of c-di-AMP can be extended to include the main free anions in bacteria.",2150-7511 (Electronic),2021 Apr 8,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4947-0519', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3128-1330', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2770-852X']","['mBio.00324-21 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00324-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['*Lactococcus', '*antibiotic resistance', '*cyclic di-AMP', '*lactic acid bacteria', '*osmolyte', '*osmolytes', '*osmoregulation', '*regulation', '*second messenger']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Pham et al.'],,

SjS results from autoimmune attack on exocrine (salivary and lacrimal) glands, and women are nine times more likely to be affected than men. To date, no vaccine or therapeutic exists to treat SjS, and patients must rely on lifelong therapies to alleviate symptoms. METHODS: Oral treatment with the adhesin from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) fimbriae protects against several autoimmune diseases in an antigen (Ag)-independent manner. Lactococcus lactis, which was recently adapted to express CFA/I fimbriae (LL-CFA/I), effectively suppresses inflammation by the induction of infectious tolerance via Ag-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs), that produce IL-10 and TGF-beta. To test the hypothesis that CFA/I fimbriae can offset the development of inflammatory T cells via Treg induction, oral treatments with LL-CFA/I were performed on the spontaneous, genetically defined model for SjS, C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice to maintain salivary flow. RESULTS: Six-week (wk)-old C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice were orally dosed with LL-CFA/I and treated every 3 wks; control groups were given L. lactis vector or PBS. LL-CFA/I-treated mice retained salivary flow up to 28 wks of age and showed significantly reduced incidence of inflammatory infiltration into the submandibular and lacrimal glands relative to PBS-treated mice. A significant increase in Foxp3(+) and IL-10- and TGF-beta-producing Tregs was observed.

It features two extra-cytoplasmic substrate-binding domains (SBDs) that are linked in tandem to the transmembrane domain of the transporter. The two SBDs differ in their ligand specificities, binding affinities and their distance to the transmembrane domain. Here, we elucidate the effects of the tandem arrangement of the domains on the biochemical, biophysical and structural properties of the protein. For this, we determined the crystal structure of the ligand-free tandem SBD1-2 protein from Lactococcus lactis in the absence of the transporter and compared the tandem to the isolated SBDs. We also used isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the ligand-binding affinity of the SBDs and single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to relate ligand binding to conformational changes in each of the domains of the tandem. We show that substrate binding and conformational changes are not notably affected by the presence of the adjoining domain in the wild-type protein, and changes only occur when the linker between the domains is shortened. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we combine smFRET with protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE-FRET) and show that a decrease in SBD linker length is observed as a linear increase in donor-brightness for SBD2 while we can still monitor the conformational states (open/closed) of SBD1. These results demonstrate the feasibility of PIFE-FRET to monitor protein-protein interactions and conformational states simultaneously.",2046-2441 (Electronic) 2046-2441 (Linking),2021 Apr,,['10.1098/rsob.200406 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['ABC transporter', 'Forster resonance energy transfer', 'protein-induced fluorescence enhancement', 'single-molecule spectroscopy', 'substrate-binding protein', 'tandem substrate-binding domains']",,,

Unusual bacteria (UB) have been described by new isolation techniques recently in the respiratory samples of CF patients. The aim is to investigate the effects of the presence of UB in the respiratory cultures of CF patients on clinical outcomes, necessity of treatment and prognosis. METHODS: The UB were identified by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight) mass spectrometry technology. RESULTS: Rhizobium radiobacter were detected in 2, Chyrseobacterium species (gleum and indolgenes) in 5, Aeromonas hydrophila in 1, Orchobacterium anthropy in 1,Wautersiella falsenii in 1, Leclercia adecarboxylata in 1, Delftia acidovorans in 1, Cupriavidus Gilardi in 1, R.radiobacter twith Elizabethkingia miricola in 1 and R.radiobacter with C.gleum in 1 patient. Median age of the first UB growth was 3 years. After the first UB growth, the median follow-up time was 15 months. Before the UB growth, 60.0% of the patients had respiratory colonization with methicillin-susceptible S.aureus (MSSA). UB growth were accompanied with MSSA in 66.6% of the patients. Median percentage of FEV1 before and during the UB growth for patients who could perform spirometry, were 80 and 102, respectively. Median body mass index before and during the UB growth were 16 and 16.2, respectively. These UB were not detected during the follow-ups except in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The UB growth did not cause any additional symptoms and decrease in BMI and FEV1 in patients with CF.

It is an emerging pathogen that affects immunocompromised patients, including patients with hematological malignancies or those receiving chemotherapy. Generally, L. adecarboxylata is considered a low-virulence pathogen with an excellent susceptibility profile, but some strains may be resistant to multiple antibiotics, such as b-lactams. Moreover, L. adecarboxylata is usually isolated as a part of polymicrobial cultures in immunocompetent individuals, but there have been cases where it was the only isolate. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old woman who was non-immunosuppressed and had multiple comorbidities was admitted with acute decompensated heart failure due to pneumonia. She was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics including amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin for pneumonia, but her infection worsened, and she had cardiopulmonary arrest. After resuscitation, she was stable for several days but suddenly became confused and hypotensive. The septic screen showed L. adecarboxylata bacteremia without a clear source, which was treated successfully with meropenem for 14 days. After the meropenem course, the patient developed diarrhea and was found to have severe Clostridium difficile infection. She did not respond to oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole and died. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrated an infection in a non-immunosuppressed individual by an organism that is considered an opportunistic pathogen, mainly affecting immunocompromised patients. The patient's blood culture grew L. adecarboxylata, which was sensitive to all antibiotics but resolved with meropenem treatment. Owing to increasing L. adecarboxylata infections, we recommend further studies to understand the organism's pathogenesis, risk factors, and resistance pattern.",1941-5923 (Electronic) 1941-5923 (Linking),2021 Mar 30,,"['929537 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.929537 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

METHODS: For 10 days, 25 patients who received intravenous TPN from the same batch of a formula developed sepsis and had blood cultures positive for L. adecarboxylata. Antimicrobial susceptibility and carbapenemase production were performed in 31 isolates, including one from an unopened bottle of TPN. Carbapenemase-encoding genes, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-encoding genes were screened by PCR, and plasmid profiles were determined. Horizontal transfer of carbapenem resistance was performed by solid mating. Clonal diversity was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The resistome was explored by whole-genome sequencing on two selected strains, and comparative genomics was performed using Roary. RESULTS: All 31 isolates were resistant to aztreonam, cephalosporins, carbapenems, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and susceptible to gentamicin, tetracycline, and colistin. Lower susceptibility to levofloxacin (51.6%) and ciprofloxacin (22.6%) was observed. All the isolates were carbapenemase producers and positive for blaNDM-1, blaTEM-1B, and blaSHV-12 genes. One main lineage was detected (clone A, 83.9%; A1, 12.9%; A2, 3.2%). The blaNDM-1 gene is embedded in a Tn125-like element. Genome analysis showed genes encoding resistance for aminoglycosides, quinolones, trimethoprim, colistin, phenicols, and sulphonamides and the presence of IncFII (Yp), IncHI2, and IncHI2A incompatibility groups. Comparative genomics showed a major phylogenetic relationship among L. adecarboxylata I1 and USDA-ARS-USMARC-60222 genomes, followed by our two selected strains.

METHODS: The residual platelet concentrate was cultured, with the detected microorganisms undergoing 16S genotype sequencing. Separate pathogen reduction studies were performed on the recovered bacteria, including assessment for amotosalen photoproducts. The storage container was subjected to pressure testing and microscopic examination. Environmental culture screening was performed at the hospital. RESULTS: Gram negative rods were detected in the platelet unit and cultures of both platelet component and the patient's blood grew Acinetobacter baumannii complex, Leclercia adecarboxylata and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. These strains were effectively inactivated with >7.2, 7.7, and >7.1 log10 kill, respectively. The platelet storage container revealed a leak visible only on pressure testing.

As a result of this exposure, fractures are colonized by different microorganisms, including different types of bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, causing osteomyelitis in many cases. For this reason, antibiotic treatment is common. However, carrying out antibiotic treatment without carrying out a previous antibiogram may contribute to increased resistance against antibiotics, especially in migratory wild birds. In this paper, bacterial counts regarding fracture type, bacterial identification and antibiotic resistance have been analysed in wild birds from wildlife rehabilitation centres in Spain. The results obtained showed that open fractures had higher bacterial counts (CFU/mL) than closed ones. Bacteria in family Enterobacteriaceae, identified were Escherichia spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella spp., Hafnia alvei, Proteus mirabilis, Leclercia adecarboxylata and Pantoea agglomerans. Other bacteria present in wild birds' fractures were Aeromonas spp., Enterococcus spp. Bacillus wiedmannii and Staphylococcus sciuri. All species found presented resistance to at least one of the antibiotics used. Wild birds can be implicated in the introduction, maintenance and global spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria and represent an emerging public health concern.

Comparative analysis of the labelling patterns revealed the substrate preferences, metabolic pathways, and relative carbon fluxes of the intracellular bacteria and their amoebal host during the time course of the infection cycle. Generally, the bacterial infection increased the usage of exogenous glucose via glycolysis by A. castellanii. In contrast, carbon fluxes via the amoebal citrate cycle were not affected. During the whole infection cycle, intracellular L. pneumophila incorporated amino acids from their host into the bacterial proteins. However, partial bacterial de novo biosynthesis from exogenous (13)C-Ser and, at minor rates, from (13)C-glucose could be shown for bacterial Ala, Asp, Glu, and Gly. More specifically, the catabolic usage of Ser increased during the post-exponential phase of intracellular growth, whereas glucose was utilized by the bacteria throughout the infection cycle and not only late during infection as assumed on the basis of earlier in vitro experiments. The early usage of (13)C-glucose by the intracellular bacteria suggests that glucose availability could serve as a trigger for replication of L. pneumophila inside the vacuoles of host cells.",1618-0607 (Electronic) 1438-4221 (Linking),2021 Apr 19,,"['S1438-4221(21)00033-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijmm.2021.151504 [doi]']",['eng'],Germany,"['Acanthamoeba castellanii', 'Bipartite metabolism', 'Host-pathogen interaction', 'Legionella pneumophila', 'Patho-metabolism', 'Stable isotope labelling']","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

This method is time-consuming (up to 15 days) and the specificity of the confirmation step is questionable. This study proposes the use of multiplex PCR to confirm presumptive Legionella colonies directly from the culture plate, this shortens the response time by 2 to 5 days while still reporting results in colony forming units (CFU). METHODS AND RESULTS: Two laboratories analyzed a total of 290 colonies to compare the confirmation step of Legionella spp. and Legionella pneumophila in accordance with ISO 11731 by culture growth and agglutination versus multiplex PCR. Discordant results were resolved by the swiss national reference laboratory. The data were evaluated following ISO 16140 and showed that the PCR-technique had higher specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The confirmation of Legionella spp., Legionella pneumophila and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 by multiplex PCR allows detection of positive colonies more rapidly and with higher specificity.

Yet, the dynamics of the secretion systems activity remains poorly understood, especially when machineries deal with the export of numerous effectors. We address the question of multi-effector secretion by focusing on the Legionella pneumophila Icm/Dot T4SS that translocates a record number of 300 effectors. We set up a kinetic translocation assay, based on the beta-lactamase translocation reporter system combined with the effect of the protonophore CCCP. When used for translocation analysis of Icm/Dot substrates constitutively produced by L. pneumophila, this assay allows a fine monitoring of the secretion activity of the T4SS, independently of the expression control of the effectors. We observed that effectors are translocated with a specific timing, suggesting a control of their docking/translocation by the T4SS. Their delivery is accurately organized to allow effective manipulation of the host cell, as exemplified by the sequential translocation of effectors targeting Rab1, namely SidM/DrrA, LidA, LepB. Remarkably, the timed delivery of effectors does not depend only on their interaction with chaperone proteins but implies cyclic-di-GMP signaling, as the diguanylate cyclase Lpl0780/Lpp0809, contributes to the timing of translocation.",1089-8638 (Electronic) 0022-2836 (Linking),2021 Apr 9,,"['S0022-2836(21)00186-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2021.166985 [doi]']",['eng'],England,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate the molecular and serological characteristics of Leptospira spp. isolated from wild animals and a dog in Amami Oshima Island. We obtained seven Leptospira strains by culturing kidney tissues of wild animals, such as black rats (2), wild boars (3), and rabbit (1) as well as blood from a symptomatic dog. Using flaB sequencing and microscopic agglutination test with antisera for 18 serovars, the isolates were identified as Leptospira borgpetersenii serogroups Javanica (black rat), L. interrogans serogroup Australis (black rat and dog), and L. interrogans serogroup Hebdomadis (wild boar and rabbit). The sequence type (ST) of L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica was determined to be ST143 via multilocus sequence typing (MLST) using seven housekeeping genes. For L. interrogans, MLST and multiple-locus variable-tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) revealed identical ST and MLVA types in rat and canine isolates, whereas two STs and MLVA types were identified in wild boar isolates. The STs and MLVA types of rabbit and one of the wild boars were identical. Bacterial culture and flaB-nested polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a high rate of Leptospira infection in wild boars (58.3%, 7/12), whereas Leptospira spp. were detected in 4.8% of black rats (2/42). This study revealed diverse Leptospira genotype and serotype maintenance in wild mammals on Amami Oshima Island. MLST and MLVA indicated that black rats were a source of canine infection.

Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic infection, mainly caused by Leptospira interrogans, and its dissemination across host cell barriers is essential for its pathogenesis. However, the mechanism of bacterial dissemination across epithelial cell barriers remains poorly characterized. In this study, we analyzed the interaction of L. interrogans with renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) and found that at 24 h post-infection, L. interrogans remains in close contact with the plasma membrane of the RPTEC by extracellularly adhering or crawling. L. interrogans cleaved E-cadherin and induced its endocytosis with release of the soluble N-terminal fragment into the extracellular medium. Concomitantly, a gradual decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), mislocalization of AJC proteins (occludin, claudin-10, ZO-1, and cingulin), and cytoskeletal rearrangement were observed. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated E-cadherin endocytosis prevented the decrease in TEER. We showed that disassembly of AJCs in epithelial cells and transmigration of bacteria through the paracellular route are important for the dissemination of L. interrogans in the host.

Leptospirosis in CSL is associated with a high fatality rate in rehabilitation. Evidence-based tools for estimating prognosis and guiding early euthanasia of animals with a low probability of survival are critical to reducing the severity and duration of animal suffering. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis of clinical data was used to predict survival outcomes of CSL with leptospirosis in rehabilitation. Classification tree outputs are binary decision trees that can be readily interpreted and applied by a clinician. Models were trained using data from cases treated from 2017 to 2018 at The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, CA, and tested against data from cases treated from 2010 to 2012. Two separate classification tree analyses were performed, one including and one excluding data from euthanized animals. When data from natural deaths and euthanasias were included in model-building, the best classification tree predicted outcomes correctly for 84.7% of cases based on four variables: appetite over the first 3 days in care, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and sodium at admission. When only natural deaths were included, the best model predicted outcomes correctly for 87.6% of cases based on BUN and creatinine at admission. This study illustrates that CART analysis can be successfully applied to wildlife in rehabilitation to establish evidence-based euthanasia criteria with the goal of minimizing animal suffering. In the context of a large epizootic that challenges the limits of a facility's capacity for care, the models can assist in maximizing allocation of resources to those animals with the highest predicted probability of survival.

Although Canicola is responsible for determining chronic disease in dogs, when affected by incidental serogroups such as Icterohaemorrhagiae, acute disease may occur with a predominance of clinical signs with hepatic and renal changes. In endemic areas, it is a serious public health problem. Thus, this study aims to estimate the incidence and duration of elimination of leptospires in the urine of dogs, taking another step from a previous study of our group, by a longitudinal, long-term and molecular approach. (2) Methods: A total of 125 dogs without apparent symptoms of leptospirosis were included in the study. The dogs were all PCR-negative and seronegative at the beginning of the study. Blood samples were collected for hematological examinations and urine for amplification of the lipL32 gene by PCR at five different time points during one year. (3) Results: Out of the 125 dogs, 62 became lipL32 PCR-positive (48.8% (95% CI, 47.9-49.7%)) at some point during the study, distributed as follows: at day 0, all negative; day 90, 18/125 (14.4% (95% CI, 13.5-15.3%)); day 180, 18/125 (14.4% (95% CI, 13.5-15.3%)); day 270, 12/125 (9.6% (95% CI, 8.7-10.5%)); and day 365, 14/125 (11.2% (95% CI, 10.3-12.1%)).

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the microdilution broth technique upon methanol extract (ME), aqueous extract (AE), and antibiotics against the Leptospira interrogans serovars Australis, Bataviae, Canicola, and Javanica, to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). The results were analyzed using an ELISA microplate reader combined with microscopic analysis. Synergy testing using a checkerboard assay was performed to determine the fractional inhibitory concentration index values of extracts combined with antibiotics against leptospires. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate morphological changes of leptospires caused by potential anti-leptospiral agents alone and combined with antibiotics. The MICs and MBCs for P. amarus extracts ranged from 100 to 400 microg/mL for AEs and from 400 to 800 microg/mL for MEs.

Due to the large dengue epidemics that has occurred in Brazil in recent years, it is possible that cases of leptospirosis were unreported. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study to detect leptospirosis in patients who were tested for dengue, but whose laboratory diagnoses were negative. Methods: Sera samples from 2,017 patients from 48 cities located in the central region of Sao Paulo state, Brazil, were studied. All samples were subjected to the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), 305 of which were taken from patients five days or less since the onset of symptoms, and were additionally subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The overall prevalence of leptospirosis cases was 21 (1.04%), with 20 through MAT (18 for Icterohaemorrhagiae and two for the Cynopteri serogroup) and one through PCR (amplicon sequencing compatible with Leptospira interrogans). According to previously established criteria, eight cases of leptospirosis were classified as ""confirmed"" and 13 as ""probable"". The Brazilian notification system for health surveillance had no records for 16 patients positive for leptospirosis and, thus, they were considered unreported cases. Statistical analyses revealed that the prevalence of leptospirosis was higher in men (1.56%) than in women (0.56%), and the mean age was higher in positive patients (43.7 years) than in negative ones (32.3 years). Conclusion: The results indicated that patients suspected of dengue fever had evidence of leptospirosis or Leptospira infection, and most of these cases were unreported in the Brazilian notification system.

Next generation sequencing is of great value to understand cases with infection of unknown cause, which could help in the diagnosis of uncertain Leptospira infection. CASE SUMMARY: We recently managed a patient with fever, cough and dyspnea on admission that progressed into persistent adult respiratory distress syndrome, hemoptysis and hematuria after admission. In this case, the rare Leptospira infection was clouded by the positive influenza tests at admission, delaying early Leptospira-targeted antibiotics administration. Next generation sequencing, a novel molecular diagnostic tool, provided a key hint to uncover the crucial pathogen, Leptospira interrogans, further supported by the possible occupational exposure history. Subsequent conventional penicillin and mechanical respiratory support were administrated to cure the patient successfully without any sequela.

Here, 91 stool samples from semicaptive bonobos and bonobos reintroduced in the wild, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, were screened for different infectious agents: viruses, bacteria and parasites. We showed the presence of potentially zoonotic viral, bacterial or parasitic agents in stool samples, sometimes coinfecting the same individuals. A high prevalence of Human mastadenoviruses (HAdV-C, HAdV-B, HAdV-E) was observed. Encephalomyocarditis viruses were identified in semicaptive bonobos, although identified genotypes were different from those identified in the previous fatal myocarditis epidemic at the same site in 2009. Non-pallidum Treponema spp. including symbiotic T. succinifaciens, T. berlinense and several potential new species with unknown pathogenicity were identified. We detected DNA of non-tuberculosis Mycobacterium spp., Acinetobacter spp., Salmonella spp. as well as pathogenic Leptospira interrogans. Zoonotic parasites such as Taenia solium and Strongyloides stercoralis were predominantly present in wild bonobos, while Giardia lamblia was found only in bonobos in contact with humans, suggesting a possible exchange. One third of bonobos carried Oesophagostomum spp., particularly zoonotic O. stephanostomum and O. bifurcum-like species, as well as other uncharacterized Nematoda. Trypanosoma theileri has been identified in semicaptive bonobos. Pathogens typically known to be transmitted sexually were not identified.

Rats are traded as food in the Mekong Delta, where Cambodia exports tons of rats to Vietnam. Handling wild rats is a potential health risk, but the information on Leptospira spp. carried by rats traded in the region remains limited. In this study, we investigated the carriage of Leptospira spp. in rats exported from Cambodia to Vietnam using bacterial culture, nested PCR and DNA sequencing. Isolates were then assessed using serological analysis and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and Leptospira DNA detected in rat kidney tissues was also analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Seventy-two rats (2 Bandicota indica, 57 Rattus argentiventer, 11 R. losea, 1 R. norvegicus and 1 R. rattus) were subjected to bacterial culture, and three L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica isolates were obtained from R. argentiventer (5.3%). WGS revealed that although Cambodian isolates were genetically related to L. borgpetersenii serogroup Javanica strains widely distributed in East and South-East Asian countries, they formed a different cluster from other strains. In addition to the three L. borgpetersenii sequences, the flaB sequence of L. interrogans was detected in 18 R. argentiventer and 7 R. losea kidney tissue samples (38.9%) using nested PCR followed by DNA sequencing. The L. interrogans flaB-positive samples were further analysed by MLST, revealing that seven housekeeping genes (glmU, pntA, sucA, tpiA, pfkB, mreA and caiB) contained novel sequences with distinct lineages from other sequence types.

Here, we systematically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce D-lactic acid from glucose, a renewable carbon source, at near theoretical yield. Specifically, we screened D-lactate dehydrogenase (DLDH) variants from lactic acid bacteria in three different genera and identified the Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides variant (LpDLDH) as having the highest activity in yeast. We then screened single-gene deletions to minimize the production of the side products ethanol and glycerol as well as prevent the conversion of D-lactic acid back to pyruvate. Based on the results of the DLDH screening and the single-gene deletions, we created a strain called ASc-d789M which overexpresses LpDLDH and contains deletions in glycerol pathway genes GPD1 and GPD2 and lactate dehydrogenase gene DLD1, as well as downregulation of ethanol pathway gene ADH1 using the L-methionine repressible promoter to minimize impact on growth. ASc-d789M produces D-lactic acid at a titer of 17.09 g/L in shake-flasks (yield of 0.89 g/g glucose consumed or 89% of the theoretical yield). Fed-batch fermentation resulted in D-lactic acid titer of 40.03 g/L (yield of 0.81 g/g glucose consumed).

As natural structure-forming agent, dextran has proven useful as food additive, improving the properties of several raw materials with poor technological quality, such as cereal by-products, fiber-and protein-rich matrices, enabling their use in food applications. In this study, we assessed dextran biosynthesis in situ during fermentation of brewers spent grain (BSG), the main by-product of beer brewing industry, with Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides DSM20193 and Weissella confusa A16. The starters performance and the primary metabolites formed during 24 h of fermentation with and without 4% sucrose (w/w) were followed. RESULTS: The starters showed similar growth and acidification kinetics, but different sugar utilization, especially in presence of sucrose. Viscosity increase in fermented BSG containing sucrose occurred first after 10 h, and it kept increasing until 24 h concomitantly with dextran formation. Dextran content after 24 h was approximately 1% on the total weight of the BSG. Oligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization were formed together with dextran from 10 to 24 h. Three dextransucrase genes were identified in L. pseudomesenteroides DSM20193, one of which was significantly upregulated and remained active throughout the fermentation time. One dextransucrase gene was identified in W. confusa A16 also showing a typical induction profile, with highest upregulation at 10 h. CONCLUSIONS: Selected lactic acid bacteria starters produced significant amount of dextran in brewers' spent grain while forming oligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization. Putative dextransucrase genes identified in the starters showed a typical induction profile. Formation of dextran and oligosaccharides in BSG during lactic acid bacteria fermentation can be tailored to achieve specific technological properties of this raw material, contributing to its reintegration into the food chain.",1475-2859 (Electronic) 1475-2859 (Linking),2021 Jan 22,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8319-6680'],"['10.1186/s12934-021-01515-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12934-021-01515-4 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"[""Brewers' spent grain"", 'Dextran', 'Fermentation', 'Lactic acid bacteria']",,,

LAB have the capability to metabolize a large variety of carbohydrates, but such metabolism only relies on few metabolic routes, conferring on them a high fermentation potential. One example of these pathways is that involving phospho-beta-glucosidase genes, which are present in high redundancy within LAB genomes. This enzymatic activity undertakes an ambivalent role during fermentation of plant-based foods related to the release of a wide range of phenolic compounds, from their beta-D-glycosylated precursors and the degradation of beta-glucopyranosyl derived carbohydrates. We proposed a novel phenomic approach to characterize the metabolism drift of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides caused by a lignocellulosic by-product, such as the brewers' spent grain (BSG), in contrast to Rich De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) broth. We observed an increased metabolic activity for gentiobiose, cellobiose and beta-glucoside conjugates of phenolic compounds during BSG fermentation. Gene expression analysis confirmed the importance of cellobiose metabolism while a release of lignin-derived aglycones was found during BSG fermentation. We provided a comprehensive view of the important role exerted by LAB 6-phospho-beta-glucosidases as well the major metabolic routes undertaken during plant-based fermentations.

However, the lack of gluten of legume flours can restrict their use due to their poor technological properties. To overcome such issue, the in situ production of bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) during fermentation has been proposed. In this study, an EPS-producing lactic acid bacteria for in situ production in chickpea sourdough was isolated. After several backsloppings of the spontaneously fermented chickpea flour dough, a dominant strain of Weissella confusa was isolated and identified. W. confusa Ck15 was able to produce linear dextran with 2.6% alpha-(1 --> 3) linked branches, from sucrose. Temperature of 30 degrees C, dough yield of 333, and 2% of sucrose addition were used to produce fermented chickpea sourdoughs. The acidification and rheology of the sourdoughs inoculated with W. confusa Ck15, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides DSM 20193, as positive control, and Lactobacillus plantarum F8, as negative control, were compared. The in situ dextran production by W. confusa Ck15 fermentation led to the highest viscosity increase (5.90 Pa.s) and the highest EPS percentage in the doughs (1.49%), compared to the other doughs.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the microbial dynamics and volatilome profile occurring during kefir production through traditional and backslopping methods by using five kefir grains that were collected in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The results from conventional pour plating techniques and amplicon-based sequencing were combined. The kefir drinks have also been characterized in terms of their physico-chemical and colorimetric parameters. A bacterial shift from Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens to Acetobacter syzygii, Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides from kefir grains in traditional kefir to backslopped kefir was generally observed. Despite some differences within samples, the dominant mycobiota of backslopped kefir samples remained quite similar to that of the kefir grain samples. However, unlike the lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria, the yeast counts decreased progressively from the grains to the backslopped kefir. The backslopped kefir samples showed higher protein, lactose and ash content and lower ethanol content compared to traditional kefir samples, coupled with optimal pH values that contribute to a pleasant sensory profile. Concerning the volatilome, backslopped kefir samples were correlated with cheesy, buttery, floral and fermented odors, whereas the traditional kefir samples were correlated with alcoholic, fruity, fatty and acid odors. Overall, the data obtained in the present study provided evidence that different kefir production methods (traditional vs backslopping) affect the quality characteristics of the final product.

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an example of an emerging virus that has become a significant concern worldwide because of its association with severe congenital malformations and neurological disorders in adults. Several polyphenol-rich extracts from plants were used as nutraceuticals which exhibit potent in vitro antiviral effects. Here, we demonstrated that the papaya pulp extracted from Carica papaya fruit inhibits the infection of ZIKV in human cells without loss of cell viability. At the non-cytotoxic concentrations, papaya pulp extract has the ability to reduce the virus progeny production in ZIKV-infected human cells by at least 4-log, regardless of viral strains tested. Time-of-drug-addition assays revealed that papaya pulp extract interfered with the attachment of viral particles to the host cells.

The average crystallite sizes of the fluorite phase obtained from X-ray diffraction were between 7 and 16 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis further confirmed the synthesis of CeO2 and Sn-doped CeO2 NPs. Almost spherical shapes of the nanomaterials with an average particle size of 12-17 nm were determined using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies. Photoantioxidant activities of the synthesized materials showed enhanced photoantioxidant response under visible light irradiation in comparison with those under dark conditions in both dose- and time-dependent manner. The CeO2 NPs exhibited a significant concentration-dependent antibiofilm activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes). Only the 10% Zr/Sn-dual doped-CeO2 NPs were found to inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation at higher concentrations. All Zr/Sn-dual doped CeO2 NPs exhibited a concentration-dependent biofilm inhibition of L. monocytogenes and also bactericidal activity towards S. aureus. These nanomaterials exhibited enhanced photoantioxidant activities and antibacterial properties, which make them suitable for various biological applications.",2047-4849 (Electronic) 2047-4830 (Linking),2021 Apr 28,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6033-6284', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4902-3188', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9830-4306', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3073-6281', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2465-8013', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8633-7493']",['10.1039/d1bm00298h [doi]'],['eng'],England,,,,

A food product can become contaminated with L. monocytogenes anywhere along the pathway of food production during planting, harvesting, packaging, distribution and serving. The aim of this work was to assess the microbiological risks associated with consumption of ready- to- eat fruit such as melon, pineapple, coconut and fruit salad. The presence of Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes was also evaluated. Microbiological challenge tests were carried out for the evaluation of the L. monocytogenes growth potential in RTE fruit stored at 4 and 8 degrees C. E. coli counts resulted under the detection limit of 10 CFU g(-1), Salmonella and L. monocytogenes were not detected (absence in 25g). The growth potential values in coconut and melon (delta>0.5) showed the growth capacity of Listeria at the temperatures considered. A low initial load, also derived from good hygiene practices, and correct storage temperatures are essential to reduce bacterial growth in RTE fruit. The challenge test showed how each type of RTE fruit has a different commercial life based on its specific growth potential and that food should be stored at temperatures not higher than 4 degrees C for a short period.",2239-7132 (Print) 2239-7132 (Linking),2021 Mar 11,,['10.4081/ijfs.2021.9337 [doi]'],['eng'],Italy,"['Growth Potential', 'Listeria monocytogenes', 'challenge test', 'fresh fruit', 'ready-toeat (RTE)']",['(c)Copyright: the Author(s).'],,

The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify Listeria species, assess factors for contamination of beef, and antibiogram of Listeria monocytogenes in Ambo and Holeta towns, Central Ethiopia. Materials and Methods: A total of 450 meat samples were collected from abattoirs (n=150), butchers (n=150), and restaurants (n=150) for isolation and identification of Listeria species. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the occurrence of Listeria species in meat and potential risk factors. The antimicrobial susceptibility test was done using the Kirby Bauer test. Results: The overall occurrence of Listeria species in Ambo and Holeta towns was 28.4% (128/450; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 24.3-32.9%). The isolation rate of Listeria monocytogenes was 4.4%, Listeria ivanovii 2.2%, Listeria seeligeri 1.8%, Listeria welshimeri 3.8%, Listeria innocua 6.2%, and Listeria grayi 10.2%. The probability of contamination of meat in butchers and restaurants was higher in Holeta than Ambo [OR=3.4; 95%; p=0.001], in dry than wet season [OR=5.2; p=0.009], and where the hygiene of cutting boards was poor (OR=7.7; p=0.008). Of the 20 Listeria monocytogenes isolates, 80%, 70%, 60%, and 55% were resistant to oxacillin, amikacin, and nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline, respectively. The Listeria monocytogenes isolates were 95%, 90%, and 85% susceptible to amoxicillin, vancomycin, and clindamycin, respectively. About 95% of Listeria monocytogenes isolates were multidrug-resistant. One isolate (5%) had developed resistance to 10 classes of antimicrobial drugs. Conclusion: Listeria species are widespread and study towns, season, and hygiene of cutting boards are independent predictors of isolation of Listeria species. Multidrug resistance among Listeria monocytogenes was very high.

Although L. monocytogenes may be transferred from the environment to vegetables during farming, contamination of food products most commonly occurs in food processing facilities, where L. monocytogenes has the ability to establish and persist on processing equipment. The current study was undertaken to collect data on the occurrence of L. monocytogenes and the identity of the endogenous microbiota in a fresh produce processing facility, for which information has remained scarce. L. monocytogenes was not detected in the facility. Experiments simulating conditions in the processing environment were performed, including examination of bacterial growth in nutrients based on vegetables (salad juice) compared to in other types of nutrients (fish, meat). Results showed that the endogenous microbiota (dominated by Pseudomonas) grew well in iceberg lettuce and rocket salad juice at low temperatures, while growth inhibition of L. monocytogenes was observed, particularly in rocket salad juice. The anti-listerial activity in rocket salad juice was retained in a polar chromatographic fraction containing several metabolites. Characterization of this active fraction, using LC-MS/MS, led to identification of 19 compounds including nucleosides and amino acids. Further work is necessary to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for the inhibitory activity of rocket salad constituents.

Bacteriophage have potential as biocontrol strategies for L. monocytogenes. In this study, the lytic capacity of a commercial Listeria phage cocktail was evaluated against a library of 475 Listeria spp. isolates (426 L. monocytogenes and 49 other Listeria spp.) with varied genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. The lytic capacity of the Listeria phages was measured by spot assays where lysis was scored on a scale of 0-3 (0 = no lysis; 1 = slight lysis; 2 = moderate lysis; 3 = confluent lysis). Only 5% of all tested Listeria spp. isolates, including L. monocytogenes, were either moderately or highly susceptible (score 2 or 3) to lysis by Listeria phage when scores were averaged across temperature and phage concentration; 155 of 5700 treatment (multiplicity of infection [MOI] and temperature) and characteristic (genotype, sanitizer tolerance, and attachment capacity) combinations resulted in confluent lysis (score = 3). Odds ratios for susceptibility to lysis were calculated using multinomial logistic regression. The odds of susceptibility to lysis by phage decreased (p < 0.05) if the L. monocytogenes isolate was previously found to persist or if the phage-bacteria culture was incubated at 30 degrees C; neither isolate persistence or temperature was significant (p >/= 0.05) when all factors were considered. In addition, lytic efficacy varied (p < 0.05) among pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pulsotypes and may be affected by host MOI (p < 0.05). There was no effect (p > 0.05) of attachment capacity or sanitizer tolerance on phage susceptibility.

A novel acidic lipase has been isolated from the lipolytic bacteria Micrococcus luteus EMP48-D (LipEMP48-D) screened from tempeh. The lipase gene had previously been overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21, but the expression level obtained was relatively low. Here, to improve the expression level, the lipase gene was cloned to Pichia pastoris. We eliminated the native signal sequence of M. luteus and replaced it with alpha-mating factor (alpha-MF) signal sequence. We also optimized and synthesized the lipase gene based on codon preference in P. pastoris. RESULTS: LipEMP48-D lipase was expressed as an extracellular protein. Codon optimization has been conducted for 20 codons, with the codon adaption index reaching 0.995. The highest extracellular lipase activity obtained reached 145.4 +/- 4.8 U/mg under AOX1 promoter in P. pastoris KM71 strain, which was 9.7-fold higher than the previous activity in E. coli. LipEMP48-D showed the highest specific activity at pH 5.0 and stable within the pH range 3.0-5.0 at 40 degrees C. LipEMP48-D also has the capability of hydrolyzing various long-chain triglycerides, particularly olive oil (100%) followed by sunflower oil (88.5%). LipEMP48-D exhibited high tolerance for various polar organic solvents with low log P, such as isopropanol (115.7%) and butanol (114.6%). The metal ions (Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Mn(+)) decreased enzyme activity up to 43.1%, while Fe(2+) increased relative activity of enzymes up to 200%. The conversion of free fatty acid (FFA) into fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was low around 2.95%. CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to report overexpression of Micrococcus lipase in yeast.

In this study, zymosan significantly induced the formation of ETs in the hemocytes of Ruditapes philippinarum, and this effect was accompanied by translocation of the mitochondria to the cell surface. Zymosan stimulation clearly induced an increase in intracellular ROS and MPO production and an overexpression of ROS-related genes (PI3K, AKT and HIF). In response to the ROS burst, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opened. Conversely, mitochondrial superoxide inhibitor (Mito-TEMPO) significantly inhibited the formation of ETs, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS were necessary for the formation of ETs. In addition, we found that zymosan-induced ETs showed antibacterial activities against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, such as Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio harveyi, Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus.

Recently, the lethal disease, the American foulbrood (AFB), caused great losses of honeybee and decline of global apiculture. Recent studies have focused on using natural insect-derived antibiotics to overcome recently emerged AFB-resistance to conventional antibiotics. In support of these studies, here we investigate the possibility of producing bee-derived anti-AFB antibiotics from an indigenous honeybee, Apis mellifera jemenitica.

Data indicated a strong immune response against M. luteus, E. coli and P. larvae 24 h post-P. larvae-injection as revealed by the detection of lysozyme-like, cecropin-like and prophenoloxidase (PO) activities in the plasma of P. larvae-injected third instars. Nodulation activity against injected P. larvae as early as 4 h and peaking 48 h post-P. larvae injection were observed. Potentially active anti-P. larvae immune peptide fractions purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed significant in vivo therapeutic effects on P. larvae-infected first instars. Mass spectrophotometric analysis and Orbitrap measurements of P. larvae-injected plasma indicated the expression of PO (Mr: 80 kDa), beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein (Mr: 52 kDa) and serine protease 44 isoform X1 (Mr: 46 kDa). This suggests that one or all of these immune peptides contribute to significant survivorship of P. larvae-infected broods, and could be a valuable clue in the search for honeybee-derived anti-AFB natural therapeutic agents. Further molecular characterization and description of the functional roles of these predicted antimicrobial peptides from both broods and adult honeybee may enrich the arsenal of insect-derived antibiotics of therapeutic purposes.",1319-562X (Print) 2213-7106 (Linking),2021 Mar,,"['10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.12.026 [doi]', 'S1319-562X(20)30679-3 [pii]']",['eng'],Saudi Arabia,"['American foulbrood', 'Apiaries', 'Apis mellifera jemenitica', 'Honeybees', 'Immune peptides', 'Natural antibiotics']",['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,

OBJECTIVE: Herein, it was aimed to elucidate bioactive potential of a marine-derived Streptomyces ovatisporus S4702T, isolated previously. METHODS: Streptomyces ovatisporus S4702T was cultured in N-Z Amine broth and extraction was carried out using different organic solvents. Bioassay guided purification was followed by chemical characterization using NMR and LC-MS/MS. The compound was then evaluated for its antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. RESULTS: Etyl acetate extracts gave the highest antibacterial activity and chemical characterization of this extract indicated the formula as C15H29O5N3 and the corresponding possible molecular structure as 4H-chromen-4-one derivative. It was found highly potent against Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 (MIC: 0.25 microg ml-1) and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 (MBC: 0.5 microg ml-1). It has no remarkable antioxidant activity, but higher EC50 value and less cytotoxicity against normal cells. The EC50 values of this chromen derivative were found as 9.68 microg ml-1 for human colon carcinoma, 9.93 microg ml-1 for human prostate adenocarcinoma and 25.5 microg ml-1 for human embryonic kidney cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, the presented 4H-chromen-4-one derivative is a remarkable bioactive compound with potent antibacterial and cytotoxic activity.

Here, the problem of bacterial escape and the exchange of metabolism products from hydrogel microparticles within an aqueous environment are addressed. Bacteria are encapsulated in chemically cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel-microparticles followed by their encapsulation in a pH-responsive and soft antibacterial shell of poly(N,N-diethylamino ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA). This polymer shell acts selectively with regards to the mass transport in and out of the microparticle core and is affected by environmental parameters, such as pH and antibacterial effect. The pH-responsive PDEAEMA shell forms an open porous structure that accelerates nutrient transfer into the PVA core containing living Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus). Results show that the antibacterial effect of PDEAEMA retards the escape of bacteria up to 35 days when the shell is open. Additionally, the permeation of a small molecule into the gel, for example, methylene blue dye through the core/open-shell structure, certifies a flexible barrier for mass transport, which is required in the long term for the biological activity of encapsulated M. luteus.",1616-5195 (Electronic) 1616-5187 (Linking),2021 Mar 13,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3174-3152'],['10.1002/mabi.202000419 [doi]'],['eng'],Germany,"['Micrococcus luteus', 'antibacterial polymers', 'core/shell polymer microparticles', 'encapsulation']",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Polygala plants are rich sources of promising microbiomes, of which the literature reports several pharmacological effects, such as trypanocidal, antinociceptive, anesthetic, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsant activities. B. cepacia COPS belongs to a new sequence type (ST 1870) and harbors a genome estimated in 8.3 Mbp which exhibits the aminoglycosides and beta-lactams resistance genes aph(3')-IIa and bla TEM-116, respectively. Analysis performed using MLST, average nucleotide identity, and digital DNA-DNA hybridization support its species-level identification and reveals its novel housekeeping genes alleles gyrB, lepA, and phaC. The root endophyte B. cepacia COPS drew our attention from a group of 14 bacterial isolates during the primary screening for being potentially active against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and exhibited the broad-spectrum activity against phytopathogenic fungi. In addition, COPS strain showed production of protease, lipase, and esterase in solid media, and its natural product extract showed potent inhibition against fungal plant pathogens, such as Moniliophthora perniciosa, whose antagonism index (89.32%) exceeded the positive control (74.17%), whereas Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Ceratocystis paradoxa showed high percentages of inhibition (85.53% and 82.69%, respectively). COPS crude extract also significantly inhibited S. epidermidis ATCC 35984, E. faecium ATCC 700221 (MIC values of 32 mug/mL for both), E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (64 mug/mL), and S. aureus ATCC 25923 (128 mug/mL). We observed moderate antagonistic activity against A. baumannii ATCC 19606 and E. coli ATCC 25922 (both at 512 mug/mL), as well as potent cytotoxic effects on Leishmania infantum and Leishmania major promastigote forms with 78.25% and 57.30% inhibition. In conclusion, this study presents for the first time the isolation of an endophytic B. cepacia strain associated with P. paniculata and enough evidence that these plants may be considered a rich source of microbes for the fight against neglected diseases.",1687-918X (Print),2021,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5145-6487', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5977-0139']",['10.1155/2021/6618559 [doi]'],['eng'],Egypt,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Felipe de Paula Nogueira Cruz et al.'],,

Methods: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of children who had adenoidectomy for adenoid-related diseases. Demographic data, diagnoses, indications for adenoidectomy and bacterial culture results were collected. The adenoid size was measured in the lateral skull X-ray as adenoid-nasopharyngeal ratio. Associations between the culture results and the demographic data, adenoid size, and the diagnoses were analyzed. Results: There were 407 children who had adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (75.2%), otitis media with effusion (19.2%), and chronic sinusitis (5.6%). Median age was 5.9 years. Common pathogenic bacteria in the adenoid were Haemophilus influenzae (26.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (23.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (12%). The patient's age had significant association with the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria. S. pneumoniae was most prevalent in young children up to 7 years. S. aureus was more common in children over 7 years. H. influenzae had similar prevalence in all age groups. Size of the adenoid and type of adenoid-related diseases had no association with the outcome of bacterial culture.

The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant M. catarrhalis strains has created a demand for alternative treatment options. We therefore tested 23 insect antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) for their activity against M. catarrhalis in a human in vitro infection model with primary macrophages, and against commensal bacteria. Effects on bacterial growth were determined by colony counting and growth curve analysis. The inflammatory macrophage response was characterized by qPCR and multiplex ELISA. Eleven of the AMPs were active against M. catarrhalis. Defensin 1 from the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum significantly inhibited bacterial growth and reduced the number of colony forming units. This AMP also showed antibacterial activity in the in vitro infection model, reducing cytokine expression and release by macrophages. Defensin 1 had no effect on the commensal bacteria Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. However, sarcotoxin 1 C from the green bottle fly Lucilia sericata was active against M. catarrhalis and E. coli, but not against E. faecalis. The ability of T. castaneum defensin 1 to inhibit M. catarrhalis but not selected commensal bacteria, and the absence of cytotoxic or inflammatory effects against human blood-derived macrophages, suggests this AMP may be suitable for development as a new therapeutic lead against antibiotic-resistant M. catarrhalis.",2150-5608 (Electronic) 2150-5594 (Linking),2021 Dec,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0180-2529', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2767-3606']",['10.1080/21505594.2021.1908741 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['Antimicrobial peptides', 'Moraxella catarrhalis', 'antibiotic resistance', 'commensals', 'defensin', 'inflammation', 'insect', 'macrophages']",,,

Bronchiectasis is a heterogenous disease that features among these chronic respiratory conditions in this population. However, there are sparse comparative data between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis from this region. METHODS: In this retrospective study, demographics, clinical characteristics and relevant laboratory parameters were compared among adult Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2012 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 388 adults had radiology-confirmed bronchiectasis and 258 (66%) were Aboriginal. Compared to non-Aboriginal patients, Aboriginal patients were significantly younger (mean age 54 v 67 years), the majority lived in rural and remote communities (80% v 9 %), had higher rates of self-reported smoking (52% v 19%), alcohol consumption (29% v 12%) and co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (65% v 38%) and other chronic co-morbidities. Sputum microbiology was also different between the groups with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis being more common in Aboriginal patients, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus species and non-tuberculous mycobacteria were higher in non-Aboriginal patients. Further, Aboriginal patients had poorer lung function compared to non-Aboriginal patients (forced expiratory volume after 1 second predicted 33% v 53%, forced vital capacity predicted 49% v 60% respectively), higher exacerbation rates (29% v 18%) and poorer overall outcomes (age at death 60 v 76 years). CONCLUSION: Within a single health service, Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis have significantly poorer outcomes with differing manifestations and higher comorbidities than non-Aboriginal patients.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of early life nasal and nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage with eczema phenotypes, and the direction of any associations identified. METHODS: Among 996 subjects of a population-based prospective cohort study, nasal swabs for Staphylococcus aureus, and nasopharyngeal swabs for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were collected and cultured from age 6 weeks to 6 years. Never, early, mid-, late transient and persistent eczema phenotypes were identified from parental-reported physician-diagnosed eczema from age 6 months until 10 years. Multinomial regression models and cross-lagged models were applied. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage at 6 months was associated with an increased risk of early transient and persistent eczema (OR (95% CI): 2.69 (1.34, 5.39) and 4.17 (1.12, 15.51)). The associations between Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage and eczema were mostly cross-sectional, and not longitudinal.

CONCLUSIONS: Early life Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage, but not Staphylococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenza nasopharyngeal carriage, was associated with early transient and persistent eczema.

This single-center, retrospective study included immunocompetent infants (<10 months old) with laboratory-confirmed RSV infection admitted to our center between January 2012 and December 2019. Incidence of neutropenia (<1.0 x 10(9)/L) within 10 days of onset and risk factors associated with subsequent neutropenia were evaluated. Among the 292 infants with RSV infection, including 232 (79%) with mild infection, neutropenia was observed in 31 (11%), with severe neutropenia (<0.5 x 10(9)/L) in 3 (1.0%). No neutropenic infants developed serious infection or hematological disorder. Infants without neutropenia showed age <3 months at onset in 34%, C-reactive protein level <1.0 mg/L in 27%, and nasopharyngeal microbiota composition with any of Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae in 63%. In comparison, infants with neutropenia showed age <3 months at onset in 74% (relative risk [RR] 2.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65-2.81), C-reactive protein level <1.0 mg/L in 55% (RR 2.02; 95% CI 1.38-2.94), and microbiota including Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae in 15% (RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10-0.61). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that younger age at onset and absence of that nasopharyngeal microbiota profile were associated with development of neutropenia.

METHODS: Thirty-seven children, 2-7 years of age, scheduled for adenoidectomy were enrolled into this prospective study at Rockhampton, Australia. Adenoid biopsy and nasopharyngeal aspirate bacteriology were assessed by conventional culture. Demographic and environmental data were collected by questionnaire. Statistical analyses for descriptive, comparison and logistic regression tests between microbial, demographic, environmental and clinical groups were applied. RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were detected in 38, 38, 35 and 24% of cases, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae was an independent determinant for non-typeable H. influenzae and S. aureus colonisation, and S. aureus was an independent determinant for S. pneumoniae colonisation. The nasopharyngeal aspirate otopathogen cultures were strong predictors for otopathogens in the adenoid, with moderate-high test accuracy for all otopathogens (receiver operator characteristics area under the curve ranging from 71 to 97% for the otopathogens tested). Children with positive non-typeable H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus nasopharyngeal aspirate cultures were more likely to have the equivalent species in adenoid cultures (positive likelihood ratios = undefined, 15.0, 9.09 and 5.85, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that nasopharyngeal aspirate cultures are an indicator of otopathogens in the adenoid. Nasopharyngeal aspirate cultures may provide clinicians with information that informs clinical management.

While many human strains are sequenced, only the genomes of few poultry strains are available. Here, we performed a detailed characterization of five highly resistant Morganella morganii strains isolated in association with Escherichia coli from diseased domestic Austrian poultry flocks, namely geese, turkeys and chicken layers. Additionally, we sequenced the genomes of these strains by NGS and analyzed phylogenetic clustering, resistance and virulence genes in the context of host-specificity. RESULTS: Two strains were identified to be Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) and one as AmpC beta-lactamases (AMP-C) phenotype, while two were ESBL negative. By integrating the genome sequences of these five poultry strains with all the available M. morganii genomes, we constructed a phylogenetic tree that clearly separates the Morganella genus into two clusters (M1 and M2), which approximately reflect the proposed subspecies classification (morganii and sibonii). Additionally, we found no association between phylogenetic structure and host, suggesting interspecies transmission. All five poultry strains contained genes for resistance to aminocoumarins, beta-lactams, colistin, elfamycins, fluoroquinolones, phenicol, rifampin and tetracycline. A comparative genomics analysis of virulence genes showed acquisition of novel virulence genes involved in secretion system and adherence in cluster M2. We showed that some of these genes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer from closely related Morganellaceae species and propose that novel virulence genes could be responsible for expansion of tissue tropism in M. morganii. Finally, we detected variability in copy number and high sequence divergence in toxin genes and provided evidence for positive selection in insecticidal toxins genes, likely reflecting host-related adaptations. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study describes i) the first isolation and characterization of M. morganii from goose and turkey, ii) a large-scale genetic analysis of M. morganii and an attempt to generate a global picture of the M. morganii intraspecific phylogenetic structure.",1471-2164 (Electronic) 1471-2164 (Linking),2020 Aug 24,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2347-2030'],"['10.1186/s12864-020-07001-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-020-07001-2 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Antimicrobial resistance', 'MALDI-TOF MS', 'Morganella morganii', 'NGS data', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry', 'Virulence genes']",,,

The 48 bacterial strains, which were previously isolated and identified were subjected to disc diffusion and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) determination, followed by investigating the production of the three beta-lactamases (ESBLs (Extended-spectrum Beta-lactamases), MBLs (Metallo Beta-lactamases), AmpCs) and exploring prevalence of the two antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs); blaTEM and qnrS. Higher MIC values were observed for penicillin(s) than that for fluoroquinolones (ampicillin > amoxicillin > ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin > levofloxacin). Resistance rates were high (58-89%) for all of the tested beta-lactams. Among the tested strains, 5 were ESBL producers (4 Aeromonas spp. and 1 Escherichia sp.), 2 were MBL producers (1 Stenotrophomonas sp. and 1 Citrobacter sp.) and 3 were AmpC producers (2 Pseudomonas spp. and 1 Morganella sp.). The ARGs qnrS2 and blaTEM were detected in Aeromonas spp. and Escherichia sp. The results highlighted the role of Aeromonas as a vector. The study reports bacteria of multidrug resistance nature in the wastewater environment of Pakistan, which harbor ARGs of clinical relevance and could present a public health concern.",2190-572X (Print) 2190-5738 (Linking),2020 Sep,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2343-822X'],"['10.1007/s13205-020-02366-3 [doi]', '2366 [pii]']",['eng'],Germany,"['Antibiotic resistance', 'Antibiotic resistance genes', 'Beta-lactamases', 'Resistant bacteria', 'Wastewater']",['(c) King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2020.'],,

Study Design: Electronic medical records of 1,056 children, admitted to the Poriya Medical Center in Israel, between 2010 and 2017 with positive urine cultures, were reviewed for bacterial species and antibiotics resistance. Results: The leading pathogen was Escherichia coli (76%), followed by Klebsiella (7%), Enterococcus (5.8%), and Proteus (4%). Statistically significant gender-specific and ethnicity-specific differences in the distribution of uropathogens were found. E. coli was more common in females compared to males. Escherichia coli constituted most (92.3%) of the ESBL-positive cultures, while only 4.6% isolates carried Klebsiella, 1.5% carried Enterobacter spp., and 1.5% carried Morganella. Prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli increased throughout the study period. Increasing prevalence over time was noted for ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and ampicillin resistance. Conclusions: Gender and ethnic background should be taken into consideration when choosing empiric antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections in children. Similarly, the continuous increase in resistance to cefuroxime and amoxicillin/clavulanate should be considered when prescribing therapy in Israel.

We also gauged hospital staff understanding of ESBLs, the procedures in place to identify, treat and infections containing. METHODS: Hospital records from 2016 were analysed and 352 ESBL from several samples types were identified using VITEK(R) 2 system and by phenotypic confirmation using a disk diffusion test. HCWs attitudes and knowledge were assessed using a paper questionnaire. RESULTS: The percentage of ESBL isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae(n=148; 42.1%) or Escherichia coli(n=176; 50%), Proteus mirabilis(n=7; 2%), Morganella morganii(n=13; 3.7%), Enterobacter (n=7; 2%) and Citrobacter freundii (n=1; 0.3%). Overall tigecycline susceptibility was 82.2%, however P. mirabilis and M. morganii isolates were uniformly resistant and K. pneumoniae susceptibility levels were significantly lower than for E. coli in urine samples (72.3% v 100%; Chi square=13.76, p=0.0002); for blood samples there was also apparently higher resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates.

This study therefore tested the prevalence of ESBL and PMQR genes in selected bacteria isolated from poultry faeces. Faecal droppings of birds were collected from 11 farms in five states in South Western Nigeria. Bacteria were isolated from the samples on cefotaxime supplemented plates and identified with MALDI-TOF. The MIC was determined using VITEK system and resistance genes were detected with PCR. A total of 350 strains were isolated from different samples and selected strains were identified as 23 Klebsiella pneumonia, 12 Morganella morganii, seven Leclercia adecarboxylata and one Citrobacter freundii. All the species were resistant to gentamycin, trimethoprim/sulphamethaxole, tobramycin, piperacillin, cefotaxime and aztreonam (except Morganella morganii strains which were mostly susceptible to aztreonam). All the tested strains were susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and amikacin. All Leclercia adecarboxylata strains were resistant to ceftazidime, cefepime and fosfomycin while all Morganella morganii strains were resistant to fosfomycin, moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. All tested species were generally sensitive to ciprofloxacin except Morganella morganii strains which were resistant to ciprofloxacin. The resistance to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, tigercylin, colistin and fosfomycin were 65%, 40%, 23%,, 7%, 33%, 48% respectively while the prevalence of SHV, TEM and CTX genes were 42%, 63%, 35% respectively. 9.3% of the isolates had the three ESBL genes, 2.33% had qnrA gene, 4.65% had qnr B gene while none had qnrS gene. The most prevalent PMQR gene is Oqxb (25.58%) while 6.98% had the qep gene. Klebsiella pneumoniae generally had both ESBL and PMQR genes.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis can reduce the risk of SSI by as much as 75%. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens make the successful use of such prophylaxis a challenge and are a real threat to patient care following colorectal surgery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to report the common characteristics of SSIs after colorectal surgery and to highlight the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical relevance of ESBL infections among these patients in a tertiary center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who underwent bowel resection operation (ie, laparoscopy, laparotomy, or laparoscopic-assisted colectomy) for benign or malignant colorectal disease were identified retrospectively from the prospective database of the colorectal department in the authors' tertiary center from March 2015 to March 2016. RESULTS: There were 123 patients included in this study, of which 21% (n = 26) had a SSI. The microorganisms isolated in the surgical sites included Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Enterobacter cloacae. Thirty-eight percent of the wound infections grew ESBL-producing pathogens in their wound cultures and 62% grew non-ESBL microbes. CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of the wound infections were due to ESBL-producing pathogens, which were resistant to the antibiotic prophylaxis given. Inappropriate antibiotic usage can delay postoperative recovery. High-risk patients for ESBL colonization may benefit from preoperative screening based on an established protocol. The cost effectiveness of an ESBL screening program needs to be further studied.",1943-2704 (Electronic) 1044-7946 (Linking),2017 Dec,,,['eng'],United States,,,['EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)'],"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Bacteria/*enzymology/*pathogenicity', 'Colonic Diseases/complications/*surgery', 'Colorectal Surgery/*adverse effects', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Escherichia coli Infections/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Klebsiella Infections/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Rectal Diseases/complications/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surgical Wound Infection/*microbiology/prevention & control', 'beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis']"

Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) is an environmental organism and opportunistic pathogen. MABSC pulmonary infections in people with cystic fibrosis are of growing clinical concern. Resistance data guide the use of macrolides and amikacin in MABSC pulmonary disease treatment. MABSC can acquire resistance against macrolides or amikacin via 23S or 16S rRNA gene mutations, respectively.Gap Statement. Current culture-based methods for MABSC detection and antibiotic resistance characterization are typically prolonged, limiting their utility to directly inform treatment or clinical trials. Culture-independent molecular methods may help address this limitation.Aim. To develop real-time PCR assays for characterization of key 23S or 16S rRNA gene mutations associated with constitutive resistance in MABSC.Methodology. We designed two real-time PCR assays to detect the key 23S and 16S rRNA gene mutations. The highly conserved nature of rRNA genes was a major design challenge. To reduce potential cross-reactivity, primers included non-template bases and targeted single-nucleotide polymorphisms unique to MABSC. We applied these assays, as well as a previously developed real-time PCR assay for MABSC detection, to 968 respiratory samples from people with cystic fibrosis. The results from the molecular methods were compared to those for gold standard culture methods and 23S and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Results.The real-time PCR MABSC detection assay provided a sensitivity of 83.8 % and a specificity of 97.8 % compared to culture. The results from the real-time PCR resistance detection assays were mostly concordant (>77.4 %) with cultured isolate sequencing. The real-time PCR resistance detection assays identified several samples harbouring both resistant and susceptible MABSC, while culture-dependent methods only identified susceptible MABSC in these samples.Conclusion. Using the molecular methods described here, results for health care providers or researchers could be available days or weeks earlier than is currently possible via culture-based antibiotic susceptibility testing.",1473-5644 (Electronic) 0022-2615 (Linking),2021 Apr,,['10.1099/jmm.0.001349 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Mycobacterium abscessus', 'PCR', 'amikacin', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'azithromycin', 'clarithromycin', 'cystic fibrosis']",,,

Therefore, the objective of this finding was to assess the association of genetic polymorphisms of cytokines with tuberculosis infection. METHOD.: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and May 2018. Five ml of whole blood was collected and extracted the genomic DNA through simple salting out method. The patterns of genetic polymorphism were determined by amplification refractory method PCR using specific primers. Finally, the PCR run on electrophoresis of agarose gel and the band was visualized under UV light.

Sequencing data was compared to phenotypic drug susceptibility profiles, and the patient's collective 27-year treatment history, to further elucidate factors fostering intra-patient resistance evolution.ResultsThe patient endured five distinct TB episodes, ending in resistances to 16 drugs and a nearly untreatable XDR-TB infection. The first isolate obtained, during the patient's 5(th) TB episode, presented fixed resistance mutations to seven anti-TB drugs including isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, pyrazinamide, prothionamide, para-aminosalicyclic acid and cycloserin/terizidone. Over the next 13 years a dynamic evolution with co-existing, heterogeneous subpopulations was observed in six out of 13 sequential bacterial isolates. The emergence of drug-resistant subpopulations coincided with frequent changes in treatment regimens, which often included two or less active compounds. This evolutionary arms race between competing sub-populations, ultimately resulted in the fixation of a single XDR variant.ConclusionOur data demonstrates the complex intra-patient microevolution of Mtbc subpopulations during failing MDR/XDR-TB treatment. Designing effective treatment regimens based on rapid detection of (hetero-) resistance is key to avoid resistance development and treatment failure.",1098-6596 (Electronic) 0066-4804 (Linking),2021 Apr 26,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8353-5964'],"['AAC.02520-20 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.02520-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Sonnenkalb et al.'],,

The goal of HDT is to modulate the host response to infection, thereby improving immune defenses to reduce the duration of antibacterial therapy and/or the amount of lung damage. As a mediator of innate and adaptive immune responses involved in eliminating intracellular pathogens, autophagy is a potential target for HDT in tuberculosis. Because Mycobacterium tuberculosis modulates mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling to impede autophagy, pharmacologic mTOR inhibition could provide effective HDT. mTOR exists within two distinct multiprotein complexes, mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex-2 (mTORC2). Rapamycin and its analogs only partially inhibit mTORC1. We hypothesized that novel mTOR kinase inhibitors blocking both complexes would have expanded therapeutic potential. We compared the effects of two mTOR inhibitors: rapamycin and the orally available mTOR kinase domain inhibitor CC214-2, which blocks both mTORC1 and mTORC2, as adjunctive therapies against murine TB, when added to the first-line regimen (RHZE) or the novel bedaquiline-pretomanid-linezolid (BPaL) regimen. Neither mTOR inhibitor affected lung CFU counts after 4-8 weeks of treatment when combined with BPaL or RHZE. However, addition of CC214-2 to BPaL and RHZE was associated with significantly fewer relapses in C3HeB/FeJ compared to addition of rapamycin and, in RHZE-treated mice, resulted in fewer relapses compared to RHZE alone. Therefore, CC214-2 and related mTOR kinase inhibitors may be more effective candidates for HDT than rapamycin analogs and may have the potential to shorten the duration of TB treatment.",1098-6596 (Electronic) 0066-4804 (Linking),2021 Apr 26,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1440-9889'],"['AAC.00253-21 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.00253-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Tasneen et al.'],,

METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed database (2009-2019), and compared with a search without year restriction. Eligibility criteria were studies on systemic tattoo-related infections, including case reports, case series, outbreak investigations, reviews, and systematic reviews. RESULTS: We identified 17 manuscripts with systemic infections between 2009 and 2019, with one reported fatality. In contrast to the historical records, no reports of systemic tuberculosis, syphilis or viral (hepatitis or HIV) infections were reported within the study period. A few sporadic cases or Mycobacterium leprae (India) or regional lymphadenopathy associated with skin lesions in non-tuberculosis mycobacteria were identified. Persistent fever with rigour was common in bacterial bloodstream infections. One episode of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and several episodes of septic shock were reported, associated with cellulitis or necrotizing fasciitis within two weeks of the procedure, predominantly caused by pyogenic bacteria (S. aureus or streptococcus). Identification of lung or systemic embolisms in the absence of local symptoms, was indicative of (right or left) infective endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial bloodstream infections should be considered in subjects developing fever and rigour after tattoos, regardless of local symptoms. A shift in causative organisms has been documented, when comparing with historical reports. NTM are emerging organisms causing lymphadenopathy.

We clarified the trends and characteristics of the co-isolation of multiple NTM species. Methods To collect data on multiple NTM isolation, we first extracted all patients who visited our hospital from 2006 through 2015 with a diagnosis of NTM lung diseases other than Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and then reviewed their medical records to evaluate the co-isolation of multiple NTM species. Results Of 213 patients with non-MAC lung disease, the most common NTM species was M. gordonae (32%), followed by M. kansasii (20%) and M. abscessus (14%). Non-MAC NTM lung disease tended to be associated with middle age with a low body mass index and male predominance. Multiple NTM species were isolated from 55 (26%) of the 213 patients. The clinical characteristics associated with multiple NTM species isolation included female predominance, never smokers and the absence of cavity lesions in the lungs. The highest co-isolation rate was observed in patients with M. gordonae isolation (30%), followed by M. furtuitum isolation (26%) and M. abscessus isolation (20%). Only MAC was isolated when co-isolated with M. abscessus. Among M. szulgai, M. peregrinum and M. terrae isolation, no other NTM species were detected. Conclusion Co-isolation of multiple NTM species was not uncommon, with 26% of patients with non-MAC NTM lung diseases showing co-isolation with multiple NTM species.

In the absence of culture and identification, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) causing NTM disease are liable to be misinterpreted as tuberculosis (TB). Introduction of nucleic acid amplification testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) offers improved diagnostic accuracy, compared with smear microscopy, and also assists in differentiating MTBC from other mycobacteria. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of NTM among patients investigated for TB and describe NTM disease and treatment outcomes at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. METHODS: This is a retrospective study, data on NTM isolates among culture-positive clinical samples over 4 years (2016-19) was retrieved from laboratory records. Information on clinical specimens processed, AFB smear results, and for the AFB positive isolates, results of species identification for MTBC, and for NTM isolates, results of species characterization and drug susceptibility testing was collected. Additional clinical data including patient characteristics, treatment regimens, and outcomes were collected for patients with NTM disease treated at Gulab Devi Hospital, Lahore. RESULTS: During the study period, 12,561 clinical specimens were processed for mycobacterial culture and 3673 (29%) were reported positive for AFB. Among these 3482 (95%) were identified as MTBC and 191 (5%) as NTM. Among NTM, 169 (88%) were isolated from pulmonary and 22 (12%) from extrapulmonary specimens. Results of NTM speciation were available for 60 isolates and included 55% (n = 33) M. avium complex and 25% (n = 15) M. abscesses. Among these patients, complete clinical records were retrieved for 12 patients with pulmonary disease including nine infected with M. avium complex and three with M. abscessus. All 12 patients had a history of poor response to standard first-line anti-TB treatment. Ten patients were cured after 18 months of treatment, whereas, one with M. abscessus infection died and another was lost to follow up.

RESEARCH QUESTION: In patients who had culture conversion by month 6 in CONVERT, was conversion sustained (negative sputum cultures for 12 months on treatment) and durable (negative sputum culture for 3 months off treatment), and were there any additional safety signals associated with a full treatment course of 12 months post-conversion? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults were randomized 2:1 to receive ALIS+GBT or GBT-alone. Patients achieving culture conversion by month 6 continued therapy for 12 months followed by off-treatment observation. RESULTS: More patients randomized to ALIS+GBT (intention-to-treat) had conversion that was both sustained and durable 3 months off treatment vs patients randomized to GBT-alone (ALIS+GBT, 16.1% [36/224] vs GBT-alone, 0% [0/112], P<.0001).

Cryptococcus neoformans and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are frequently responsible of such infections. However, concurrent infection with these two pathogens is uncommon and underreported in the literature.Case description: We describe the case of a 28-year-old Caucasian Belgian patient with no travel history, who presented with low-grade fever, headache and wasting syndrome. He was diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at AIDS stage, with a HIV viral load of 506,000 viral copies/mL and a CD4 + T-cells count of 10 cells/microL. Diagnosis of disseminated Cryptococcus neoformans infection was made by positive serum cryptococcal antigen and positive culture for Cryptococcus neoformans in blood and in cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection was made by positive culture on a biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node. With adequate anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and treatment of these OIs, the patient recovered well and had a good clinical evolution.Discussion and conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the second case of coexistence of these two dangerous OIs reported in the post ART era. Clinicians should be aware that such co-infections still happen in high-income countries, in patients with severe immunodeficiency. Early detection and treatment of HIV is of paramount importance to prevent AIDS and its complications. We highlight the importance of thoroughly excluding all opportunistic infections in patients with newly diagnosed AIDS.Abbreviations: ABC: abacavir; AIDS: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; AFB: acid-fast bacilli; ART: antiretroviral therapy; CM: cryptococcal meningitis; CrAg: cryptococcal antigen; CSF: cerebrospinal fluid; CT: computed tomography; EACS: European AIDS Clinical Society; FTC: emtricitabine; HIC: high-income countries; HIV: human immunodeficiency virus; HIV-VL: HIV-viral load; ICP: intracranial pressure; IRIS: immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; MAC: Mycobacterium avium complex; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; MSM: man who has sex with men; NR: normal range; OD: omne in die = once daily; OI: opportunistic infection; RAL: raltegravir; TAF: tenofovir alafenamide fumarate.",2295-3337 (Electronic) 1784-3286 (Linking),2021 Apr 22,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8248-224X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0120-5190', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0658-1291']",['10.1080/17843286.2021.1919845 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['AIDS', 'Cryptococcus neoformans', 'HIV', 'Mycobacterium avium complex', 'opportunistic infections']",,,

However, pathological findings of patients with sarcoidosis have rarely revealed necrosis. We report here on a patient with sarcoidosis which needed to be distinguished from infectious disease because of marked necrosis in the lymph nodes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital due to a dry cough and appetite loss. A chest X-ray and computed tomography revealed markedly enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly. Surgical biopsy of these lymph nodes was performed in order to make a diagnosis. Pathological findings revealed epithelioid cell granuloma with marked necrosis that suggested infectious etiology such as mycobacterial and fungal infections. In addition to the pathological findings, immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), enlargement of lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly indicated disseminated MAC, while sarcoidosis was considered as another important differential diagnosis according to elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme, soluble interleukin-2 receptor and uveitis. While waiting for the results of the cultures of acid-fast bacilli, the symptoms of cough and consumption had worsened, and initiation of therapy was required before the confirmed diagnosis. The therapy for MAC was initiated because it was feared that immunosuppressive therapy containing corticosteroid for sarcoidosis could worsen the patient's condition if MAC infection was the main etiology. However, the treatment for MAC was not effective, and it was clarified that no acid-fast bacilli were cultured in the liquid culture medium, so the diagnosis was corrected to sarcoidosis after reconsideration of clinical and pathological findings. Prednisolone (30 mg/day) was administered orally, and the patient's symptoms and radiological findings improved. CONCLUSION: Sarcoidosis must be considered even if pathological findings reveal marked necrosis, because rare cases of sarcoidosis exhibit extensive necrosis in lymph nodes.

The burden of bTB is higher in developing countries as compared to industrialized countries. The reasons behind this discrepancy include the fact that bTB control measures, such as testing and slaughter of infected cattle and pasteurization of milk, are not usually practiced in developing countries largely because of their high cost. To improve our understanding of bTB in developing countries molecular typing studies are essential, in particular in terms of transmission dynamics, infection sources, and knowledge of circulating strains of the principal causative agent, Mycobacterium bovis. In this study, we applied a suite of molecular typing techniques encompassing deletion analysis, spoligotyping, and MIRU-VNTR to isolates recovered from samples collected during the routine post-mortem of cattle at the cold-storage abattoir in Lilongwe, Malawi. Out of 63 isolates, 51 (81 %) belonged to the European 1 M. bovis clonal complex. Spoligotyping identified 8 profiles, with SB0131 being the predominant type (56% of isolates). Spoligotypes SB0273 and SB0425 were identified in 14% and 13%, respectively, of the isolates. MIRU-VNTR showed a high discriminatory power of 0.959 and differentiated the 8 spoligotypes to 31 genotypes. The high diversity of M. bovis within the study area suggests the infection has been circulating in the area for a considerable period of time, likely facilitated by the lack of effective control measures. We also observed genetic similarities between isolates from Malawi (this study) to isolates described in previous studies in Zambia and Mozambique, suggesting transmission links in this region.

While M. bovis has been reported in humans, domestic and wild ruminants at the human-wildlife-livestock interface area in Zambia, there is paucity of information on the role of primates as reservoir hosts. We screened seven wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) for tuberculosis at the human-wildlife interface area in Lochinvar National Park in the Kafue Flats, Zambia. Following necropsy, lung tissue and associated lymph nodes with tuberculous-like lesions collected from four adult male baboons were prepared for Mycobacterium culture. The isolates were initially typed using the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex-discrimination multiplex PCR assay and further characterized by spoligotyping and 26-loci MIRU-VNTR. Mycobacteria was isolated from all four animals and identified as M. bovis by PCR. On Spoligotyping, all isolates belonged to SB 0120 spoligotype, which is similar to what was previously reported in humans, cattle and Kafue lechwe antelopes in Kafue Flats ecosystem. Furthermore, on MIRU-VNTR typing, the baboon isolates clustered with cattle and Kafue lechwe isolates from the same catchment area. This finding intimates probable cross species transmission of M. bovis in the Kafue Flats ecosystem.

However, information on M. bovis infection dynamics within this species is limited and requires investigation as M. bovis can cause conservation consequences due to movement restrictions, crucial for genetic management. This study had two aims: to investigate mycobacterial shedding in free-ranging wild dogs from KNP by culturing oropharyngeal swab (OS) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples; and to determine the test association between antemortem culture and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) results as well as agreement between OS culture and BAL culture results. Mycobacterial culture revealed that 6 of 173 (3.5%) OS samples and 1 of 32 (3.1%) BAL samples were M. bovis culture-positive, suggesting that wild dogs can shed M. bovis through respiratory secretions. However, the possibility of contamination by ingestion of infected prey cannot be excluded in wild dogs with positive OS culture results. Furthermore, the test outcomes between IGRA and culture (OS and BAL) differed substantially, with 134 out of 172 wild dogs having IGRA positive results (detectable M. bovis immune sensitization), whereas only 7 out of 173 wild dogs had culture-positive results.

Previous studies have shown that apoptotic caspases prevent the production of IFN-beta during apoptosis or virus infection. However, the relationship between apoptotic caspases and IFN-beta production during intracellular bacterial infection is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role of apoptotic caspases in IFN-beta production induced by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection. M. bovis is an intracellular bacterium and belongs to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. M. bovis infection can cause tuberculosis in animals and human beings. In the current study, we found that M. bovis infection triggered mitochondrial stress, which caused the leakage of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm, and in turn, activated the downstream caspase-9 and-3. Furthermore, our results showed that activation of apoptotic caspases reduced IFN-beta production during M. bovis infection and vice versa. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that apoptotic caspases prevented IFN-beta production by decreasing p-IRF3 nuclear translocation.

Its recent prevalence in river buffaloes has been estimated as higher as 33.7%. In emergent countries like Pakistan, there is likeliness of human-livestock interfaces extensively and lacking of effective preventive measures that illustrate the risk of spreading the infection at a remarkable rate. The river buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is an upkeep host of Mycobacterium bovis and is responsible for disease transmission among buffaloes and other livestock species. In this study, potential molecular biomarkers in the Interferon-gamma gene (IFNg) were identified after genomic screening of river buffaloes. Unique genomic loci in river buffalo proved the novelty of the genomic structure of this phenomenal animal but also highlighted its significance in natural immunity against the Mycobacterium. A total of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the coding region of IFNg. The SNPs in the exonic region were all transitions, i.e., the conversion of purines to purines. These SNPs were analyzed for Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium, chi(2) test, gene diversity, and protein structural conformation. Pathway analysis in tuberculosis revealed that IFNg inhibits the antigen-presenting cells (APC) through JAK and STAT pathways. Network analysis of IFNg proteins in both species showed strong associations among the immunity-related proteins (interleukins, tissue necrosis factors) and receptors of interferons. The identified polymorphic sites might be novel-potentiated markers for the selection of animals with superior immune response against bTB and can be exploited as promising genomic sites for breeding the resistant animal herds to combat Mycobacterium infection in a long run.",2314-6141 (Electronic),2021,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3115-282X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8500-7855', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4720-8792']",['10.1155/2021/5532864 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Maryam Javed et al.'],,

In Chile the disease in dairy cattle has a heterogeneous distribution, where the Metropolitan Region concentrates the highest animal prevalence and the main challenge for the national control and eradication program. In this epidemiological context, vaccination with the M. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine might be a useful strategy for disease prevention and control. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and impacts on productivity and fertility of vaccination with the BCG Russia strain in 11-month-old heifers from a dairy farm, under a natural transmission condition. Sixty-two animals were vaccinated via the subcutaneous route with the equivalent of 1 human dose of BCG and 60 control animals received saline. Subsequently, blood sampling was performed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months post inoculation, and infection status was determined using the IFNgamma release assay (IGRA)with the DIVA (Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals) antigens ESAT-6, CFP-10 and Rv3615c. Efficacy was calculated as the percentage of reduction in the incidence of infection attributable to vaccination, which showed a statistically significant level of overall protection of 66.5%. No adverse effects on fertility and production were recorded. In contrast, we observed beneficial effects of vaccination on several milk production parameters, with the milk yield in the first 100 days after calving in the BCG group significantly higher compared to unvaccinated heifers( p <0.05).These results suggest that BCG vaccination of heifers in a natural transmission setting might result in both sanitary and productive benefits, supporting its implementation as a new strategy for TB prevention in a high prevalence area of Chile.",1865-1682 (Electronic) 1865-1674 (Linking),2021 Apr 19,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8597-9550'],['10.1111/tbed.14108 [doi]'],['eng'],Germany,"['BCG vaccine', 'Chile', 'cattle', 'tuberculosis']",['This article is protected by copyright.

We used Illumina-based 16S rRNA V3 amplicon sequencing to investigate the community structure of bacteria from skin lesions of captive Houston toad and habitat (pond) samples. Proteobacteria, alone or together with Actinobacteria and, in some samples, Cyanobacteria represented virtually all reads in tissue lesion samples, whereas pond samples were much more diverse, with Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia present with little variation between samples. If present in lesions, Actinobacteria were largely represented by Mycobacteriaceae, and here mainly by one sequence identical to sequences of members of the Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus complex. In pond samples, mycobacteria represented only a small portion of the actinobacteria, although at higher diversity with six distinct reads. Sequences for reads obtained from pond samples were identical to those representing the M. chelonae-abscessus complex, a group with Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium avium, a group with Mycobacterium vaccae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium poriferae, and a group with Mycobacterium elephantis and Mycobacterium celeriflavum, whereas sequences of high similarity were detected for reads related to those of Mycobacterium holsaticum, Mycobacterium pallens, and Mycobacterium obuense, and Mycobacterium goodii.

The clinical manifestations of leprosy are variable and can mimic a variety of other skin diseases. Thus, histopathological examination plays an important role in early diagnosis and management. Aim: The aim was to study the clinicohistopathological correlation of all suspected cases of Hansen's disease. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 207 skin biopsies obtained from patients clinically diagnosed as new lesion of leprosy in the department of pathology from 2016 to 2019. Demographic, clinical details of the patients were retrieved from hospital information system. Hematoxylin-eosin- and Fite-Faraco-stained sections were evaluated for features confirming leprosy and further categorized as per Ridley-Jopling system. Sensitivity, specificity, and concordance rates were studied. Results: The male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1. The agreement between histopathological and clinical diagnoses was more than 90% in all the subclasses except for borderline tuberculoid leprosy (BT) and tuberculoid leprosy (TT) which showed an agreement of 86.5% and 88.4%, respectively. The sensitivity of clinical diagnosis ranged from 69.70% for indeterminate to 100% for histoid and neuritic types. The specificity ranged from 90% for BT and TT to 100% for neuritic leprosy. Conclusion: Clinical diagnosis of early leprosy lesions offers difficulties even to experienced dermatologists as a patient presents in different clinicopathological forms, depending on host immune status.

Therefore, identification of new drug targets in Mycobacterium leprae is considered of high importance. Here, we introduce an overview of in silico and in vitro studies that might be of help in this endeavor. The essentiality of M. leprae proteins is reviewed with discussion of flux balance analysis, gene expression, and knockout articles.

Lipids are an important nutrient for the intracellular survival of M. leprae. In this study, we attempted to determine the intracellular lipid composition and underlying mechanisms for changes in host cell lipid metabolism induced by M. leprae infection. Using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), we demonstrated specific induction of triacylglycerol (TAG) production in human macrophage THP-1 cells following M. leprae infection. We then used [14C] stearic acid tracing to show incorporation of this newly synthesized host cell TAG into M. leprae. In parallel with TAG accumulation, expression of host glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3 (GPAT3), a key enzyme in de novo TAG synthesis, was significantly increased in M. leprae-infected cells. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of GPAT3 in THP-1 cells (GPAT3 KO) dramatically reduced accumulation of TAG following M. leprae infection, intracellular mycobacterial load, and bacteria viability. These results together suggest that M. leprae induces host GPAT3 expression to facilitate TAG accumulation within macrophages to maintain a suitable environment that is crucial for intracellular survival of these bacilli.",1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),2021,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2544-2134', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2407-5368', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2167-9182', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8896-0764', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8659-4660']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0249184 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-21795 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

However, the results were inconclusive despite a high degree of similarity between both parameters. Herein, we carried out this meta-analysis to systematically summarize and articulate the correlation between PTPN22-C1858T polymorphism and mycobacterial infection. The susceptibility of PTPN22-C1858T carriers with autoimmune conditions receiving immunosuppressive therapy to M. tuberculosis and M. leprae infection was determined. A systematic retrieval of studies on relevance of PTPN22-C1858T polymorphism to susceptibility of M. tuberculosis or M. leprae infection was performed in Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed and Embase databases. We regarded Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the determined effect size. Finally, four and two case-control studies on tuberculosis and leprosy, respectively, were included. In all genetic models, without indicated association between PTPN22-C1858T polymorphism and tuberculosis's susceptibility.

In this context it is noteworthy looking for immunological biomarkers applicable as complementary diagnostic tools as well as a laboratorial strategy to follow-up leprosy household contacts. METHODS: The cross-sectional study enrolled 49 participants, including 19 patients and 30 healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and incubated in the presence of Mycobacterium leprae bacilli. The cells were prepared for surface (CD4(+) and CD8(+)) and intracytoplasmic cytokine staining (IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10). Multiple comparisons amongst groups were carried out by ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Student T or Mann-Whitney test. Comparative analysis of categorical variables was performed by Chi-square. Functional biomarker signature analysis was conducted using the global median values for each biomarker index as the cut-off edge to identify the proportion of subjects with high biomarker levels. RESULTS: The cytokine signature analysis demonstrated that leprosy patients presented a polyfunctional profile of T-cells subsets, with increased frequency of IFN-gamma(+) T-cell subsets along with IL-10(+) and IL-4(+) from CD4(+) T-cells, as compared to health Controls (Venn diagram report). Moreover, statistical analysis was carried out using parametric or non-parametric variance analysis followed by pairwise multiple comparisons, according to the data normality distribution. L(PB) displayed a polyfunctional profile characterized by enhanced percentage of IFN-gamma(+), IL-10(+) and IL-4(+) produced by most T-cell subsets, as compared to L(MB) that presented a more restricted cytokine functional profile mediated by IL-10(+) and IL-4(+) T-cells with minor contribution of IFN-gamma produced by CD4(+) T-cells. Noteworthy was that HHC(MB) exhibited enhanced frequency of IFN-gamma(+) T-cells, contrasting with HHC(PB) that presented a cytokine profile limited to IL-10 and IL-4. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that L(PB) displayed enhanced percentage of IFN-gamma(+), IL-10(+) and IL-4(+) as compared to L(MB) that presented functional profile mediated by IL-10(+) and IL-4(+) T-cells and HHC(MB) exhibited enhanced frequency of IFN-gamma(+) T-cells, contrasting with HHC(PB).

The disease evolves with the development of cellular anergy that impedes the production of interferon gamma (IFNgamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), and nitric oxide (NO) required to kill the microorganism. In this study we investigated whether histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) (valproic acid and sodium butyrate [NaB]) and the immunomodulator transfer factor in dialyzable leukocyte extracts (DLE) can prevent anergy in murine leprosy. Methods: Five groups of six Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with 2 x 107 MLM. Thirty-days post inoculation, treatment was started; one group received no treatment, one was treated with rifampicin-clofazimine (R-C), one with sodium valproate (VPA), one with NaB, and one with DLE. The animals were monitored for the evidence of disease for 96 days. After euthanasia, their spleens were removed and processed for histologic, bacteriologic, and cytokine studies. Results: R-C completely controlled the ongoing disease. DLE and NaB significantly reduced the development of lesions, including granuloma size and the number of bacilli; VPA was less effective. DLE, NaB, and VPA reverted the anergic condition in diverse grades and allowed the expression of IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and inducible NO synthase, also in diverse grades. Conclusion: Anergy in leprosy and murine leprosy allows disease progression. In this study, anergy was prevented, in significant degree, by DLE (an immunomodulator) and NaB (HDACi). VPA was less effective. These results suggest potential beneficial effects of DLE and NaB in the ancillary treatment of leprosy.",2212-554X (Electronic) 2212-5531 (Linking),2020 Jul-Sep,,"['IntJMycobacteriol_2020_9_3_268_293543 [pii]', '10.4103/ijmy.ijmy_31_20 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['*Anergy', '*dialyzable leukocytes extract', '*murine leprosy', '*sodium butyrate', '*valproic acid']",,,

Due to the similar clinical manifestations of human and murine leprosy and the difficulty of growing both bacilli axenically, Mycobacterium leprae and M. lepraemurium were once thought to be closely related, although it was later suggested that M. lepraemurium might be related to Mycobacterium avium In this study, the complete genome of M. lepraemurium was sequenced using a combination of PacBio and Illumina sequencing. Phylogenomic analyses confirmed that M. lepraemurium is a distinct species within the M. avium complex (MAC). The M. lepraemurium genome is 4.05 Mb in length, which is considerably smaller than other MAC genomes, and it comprises 2,682 functional genes and 1,139 pseudogenes, which indicates that M. lepraemurium has undergone genome reduction. An error-prone repair homologue of the DNA polymerase III alpha-subunit was found to be nonfunctional in M. lepraemurium, which might contribute to pseudogene formation due to the accumulation of mutations in nonessential genes. M. lepraemurium has retained the functionality of several genes thought to influence virulence among members of the MAC.IMPORTANCEMycobacterium lepraemurium seems to be evolving toward a minimal set of genes required for an obligatory intracellular lifestyle within its host, a niche seldom adopted by most mycobacteria, as they are free-living. M. lepraemurium could be used as a model to elucidate functions of genes shared with other members of the MAC. Its reduced gene set can be exploited for studying the essentiality of genes in related pathogenic species, which might lead to discovery of common virulence factors or clarify host-pathogen interactions. M. lepraemurium can be cultivated in vitro only under specific conditions and even then with difficulty. Elucidating the metabolic (in)capabilities of M. lepraemurium will help develop suitable axenic media and facilitate genetic studies.",2150-7511 (Electronic),2017 Oct 17,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4522-6575'],"['mBio.01283-17 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.01283-17 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['*Mycobacterium lepraemurium', '*comparative genomics', '*genome sequencing', '*murine leprosy']",['Copyright (c) 2017 Benjak et al.'],,"['*Evolution, Molecular', '*Genome, Bacterial', 'Mycobacterium lepraemurium/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']"

METHODS: Cases were sourced retrospectively and prospectively for this observational study, describing clinical, geographical and molecular microbiological data for cats definitively diagnosed with Candidatus 'M lepraefelis' infection. RESULTS: A total of 145 cases of feline leprosy were scrutinised; 114 'new' cases were sourced from the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) records, veterinary pathology laboratories or veterinarians, and 31 cases were derived from six published studies. Thirty-eight cats were definitively diagnosed with Candidatus 'M lepraefelis' infection. Typically, cats tended to be middle-aged or older when first infected, with a male predilection. Affected cats typically had widespread cutaneous lesions, in some cases after initially localised disease. Advanced cases were often systemically unwell. All cats had outdoor access. The histological picture was lepromatous in the majority of patients, although two cases had tuberculoid disease. In one case that underwent necropsy, lesions were evident in the liver, spleen and lungs. Treatment was varied, although most cats received a combination of oral clarithromycin and rifampicin. Prognosis for recovery was variable, but typically poor. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Candidatus 'M lepraefelis' typically causes high bacterial index (lepromatous) feline leprosy that in some cases progresses to systemic mycobacteriosis. The disease has a variable clinical course and prognosis. Many cases either died or were euthanased due to the infection. Multilocus sequence analysis reveals a heterogeneous picture and further analysis of draft genome sequencing may give clues to the taxonomy and epidemiology of this organism. Prospective treatment trials and/or additional drug susceptibility testing in specialised systems would further inform treatment recommendations. Comparative aspects: This paper finishes with a discussion of comparative aspects of infection caused by the three feline leproid disease agents that have been the subject of this series: Candidatus 'Mycobacterium tarwinense', Mycobacterium lepraemurium and Candidatus 'M lepraefelis'.",1532-2750 (Electronic) 1098-612X (Linking),2017 Sep,,['10.1177/1098612X17706470 [doi]'],['eng'],England,,,,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnosis/microbiology/pathology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Leprosy/diagnosis/microbiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Mycobacterium/*isolation & purification', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies']"

Wide surgical excision is curative for many tumors, but may not always be feasible. Previous studies have reported sarcoid regression after injection with mycobacterial cell wall immunotherapeutics. A new formulation of the Mycobacterium phlei cell wall fraction immunostimulant (Immunocidin Equine) was used to treat cutaneous tumors in horses.

The use of gold nanoparticles as carriers for glyco-epitopes is becoming an important alternative to the traditional conjugation with proteins and synthetic polymers. In this study, we aimed to prepare and evaluate in vivo glyco-gold nanoparticles (glyco-GNPs) bearing the terminal-branched hexaarabinofuranoside fragment (Ara6) of arabinan domains of lipoarabinomannan and arabinogalactan, which are principal polysaccharides of the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. In particular, we were interested whether the antibodies generated against Ara6-GNPs would recognize the natural saccharides on the cell surface of different mycobacterial strains. Two synthetic Ara6 glycosides with amino-functionalized spacer aglycons differing in length and hydrophilicity were directly conjugated with spherical gold nanoparticles (d = 15 nm) to give two sets of glyco-GNPs, which were used for the immunization of rabbits. Dot assays revealed cross-reactions between the two obtained antisera with the hexaarabinofuranoside and the 2-aminoethyl aglycon used for the preparation of glyco-GNPs. Both antisera contained high titers of antibodies specific for Mycobacteria as shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using M. bovis and M. smegmatis cells as antigens while there was only a weak response to M. phlei cells and no interaction with E. coli cells.

Owing to the current lack of effective agents that can be used as a control, the US Food and Drug Administration began to accept single-arm trials for patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), using complete response rate (CRR) and duration of response as the primary endpoints to support marketing applications. Despite the ensuing growth of clinical trials in this space, no consensus exists on a clinically relevant benchmark for CRR. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the CRR and recurrence-free rate (RFR) using bladder-sparing agents after BCG failure in order to provide a frame of reference for future clinical trial results. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of clinical trials utilizing bladder-sparing therapeutics for NMIBC recurring after intravesical BCG (PROSPERO CRD42019130553). The search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Relevant studies identified from bibliography search and conference abstracts were searched to complement the systematic review. A total of 42 studies utilizing 24 treatment options and consisting of 2254 patients were included for final analysis. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Median CRRs in the treatment of CIS-containing tumors were 26% at 6 mo, 17% at 12 mo, and 8% at 24 mo after treatment. In comparison, median RFRs in the papillary-only studies were 67% at 6 mo, 44% at 12 mo, and 10% at 24 mo. Specifically in the BCG-unresponsive population, 6- and 12-mo CRRs in CIS-containing patients treated with Mycobacterium phlei cell wall-nucleic acid complex were 45% and 27%, respectively, and the median 6-, 12-, and 24-mo disease-free rates in the other studies were 43%, 35%, and 18%, respectively. The median progression-free rate was 91%: 95% in the CIS-containing studies and 89% in studies restricted to papillary-only recurrences. Toxicities of intravesical agents were generally mild, with very few dose limiting toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that, to date, bladder-sparing therapies achieved modest efficacy in patients with NMIBC after BCG. Results from the current study will serve as a frame of reference for emerging trial results in the BCG-unresponsive space. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we found that bladder-sparing therapies achieved modest efficacy in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer after bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).

Summary: Mycobacterium phlei is a rapidly growing nontuberculous osteomyelitis which is typically nonpathogenic with only four reported cases of human infection. Diagnosing infections related to nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is difficult and can often be delayed as conventional microbiologic tests are inadequate. Currently, there are no consensus guidelines concerning the treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by NTM.

CT scan demonstrated incomplete union after fusion. He underwent irrigation and debridement on March 15, 2016, with tissue culture and biopsy. Given negative cultures and completion of a 6-week course of intravenous antibiotics, on May 3, 2016, he went for implant removal and repeat instrumentation. During the same hospitalization, deep spinal fluid acid-fast bacilli culture from March 15, 2016, came back positive at 8 weeks, identified as Mycobaterium phlei.

On the basis of this efficient system, 12 novel HTDPKs were readily obtained by using two HTDKP-forming P450s (NasbB and NASS1868). Among them, five compounds have neuroprotective properties. Our study significantly expands the bioactive chemical scope of HTDKPs and provides an excellent biocatalysis platform for dealing with problematic enzymes from Actinomycetes.",1520-6904 (Electronic) 0022-3263 (Linking),2021 Apr 22,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3301-8536'],['10.1021/acs.joc.1c00380 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,,,,

The primary structure of the cell wall core, composed of covalently linked peptidoglycan, branched heteropolysaccharide arabinogalactan, and mycolic acids, is well known, and numerous enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of its components are characterized. The cell wall biogenesis takes place at both cytoplasmic and periplasmic faces of the plasma membrane, and only recently some of the specific transport systems translocating the metabolic intermediates between these two compartments have been characterized [M. Jackson, C. M. Stevens, L. Zhang, H. I. Zgurskaya, M. Niederweis, Chem. Rev., 10.1021/acs.chemrev.0c00869 (2020)]. In this work, we use CRISPR interference methodology in Mycobacterium smegmatis to functionally characterize an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter involved in the translocation of galactan precursors across the plasma membrane. We show that genetic knockdown of the transmembrane subunit of the transporter results in severe morphological changes and the accumulation of an aberrantly long galactan precursor.

Elucidating the mechanisms of essential MTB genes provides an important theoretical basis for drug exploitation. Gene mtsp17 is essential and is conserved in the Mycobacterium genus. Although Mtsp17 has a structure closely resembling typical steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) family proteins, its biological function is different. This study characterizes the transcriptomes of Mycobacterium smegmatis to explore the consequences of mtsp17 downregulation on gene expression. Suppression of the mtsp17 gene resulted in significant down-regulation of 3% and upregulation of 1% of all protein-coding genes. Expression of desA1, an essential gene involved in mycolic acid synthesis, and the anti-SigF antagonist MSMEG_0586 were down-regulated in the conditional Mtsp17 knockout mutant and up-regulated in the Mtsp17 over-expression strain. Trends in the changes of 70 of the 79 differentially expressed genes (Log2 fold change > 1.5) in the conditional Mtsp17 knockout strain were the same as in the SigF knockout strain. Our data suggest that Mtsp17 is likely an activator of desA1 and Mtsp17 regulates the SigF regulon by SigF regulatory pathways through the anti-SigF antagonist MSMEG_0586.

Although mutations in the DNA gyrase are the principal cause of this resistance, pentapeptide proteins have been found to confer low-level FQ resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. MfpA is a pentapeptide repeat protein conserved in mycobacterial chromosomes, where it is adjacent to a group of four highly conserved genes termed a conservon. We wished to characterize the transcriptional regulation of the mfpA gene and relate its expression to ciprofloxacin resistance in M. smegmatis. Reverse transcription PCR showed that mfpA gene is part of an operon containing the conservon genes. Using a transcriptional fusion, we showed that a promoter was located 5' to the mfpEA operon. We determined the promoter activity under different growth conditions and found that the expression of the operon increases slightly in late growth phases in basic pH and in subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin. Finally, by cloning the mfpA gene in an inducible vector, we showed that induced expression of mfpA increases the ciprofloxacin Minimal Inhibitory Concentration.

We previously reported the structure of a lectin from an archaeal species, Mevo lectin, which has specificity towards terminal alpha1,2 linked manno-oligosaccharides. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) expresses mannosylated structures including, lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) on its surface and exploits C-type lectins to gain entry into the host cells. ManLAM structure has mannose capping with terminal alphaMan(1,2)alphaMan residues and is important for recognition by innate immune cells. Here, we aim to address the specificity of Mevo lectin towards high-mannose type glycans with terminal alphaMan(1,2)alphaMan residues and its effect on M. tuberculosis internalization by macrophages. ITC studies demonstrated that Mevo lectin shows preferential binding towards manno-oligosaccharides with terminal alphaMan(1,2)alphaMan structures, and showed a strong affinity for ManLAM, whereas it binds weakly to Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) lipoarabinomannan (MsmLAM), which displays relatively fewer and shorter mannosyl caps. Crystal structure of Mevo lectin complexed with a Man7D1 revealed the multivalent cross-linking interaction, which explains avidity-based high affinity for these ligands when compared to previously studied manno-oligosaccharides lacking the specific termini. Functional studies suggest that M. tuberculosis internalization by the macrophage was impaired by binding of Mevo lectin to ManLAM present on the surface of M. tuberculosis.

Standardized treatment algorithms were applied to design individualized therapies based on either genomic or phenotypic DST results, and discrepancies were further evaluated by determination of minimum inhibitory drug concentrations (MIC) using Sensititre MYCOTBI and UKMYC microtiter plates. RESULTS: In 70 patients with MDR/RR-TB, agreement among 1048 pairwise comparisons of genomic and phenotypic DST was 86.3%; 76 (7.2%) results were discordant, and 68 (6.5%) could not be evaluated due to presence of polymorphisms with yet unknown implications for drug resistance. Importantly, 549/561 (97.9%) predictions of drug susceptibility were phenotypically confirmed in MGIT, and 27/64 (42.2%) false positive results were linked to previously described mutations mediating a low or moderate MIC increase.

METHODS: MDR-TB patients were enrolled between 2013-2016 in a multi-centre prospective observational cohort study and followed for two years until treatment completion. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was applied for serial Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from study participants throughout the treatment, to study the role of microevolution, exogenous reinfection and mixed-infection in the development of second-line drug resistance.

The global increase in drug-resistant strains of various bacterial pathogens prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop a priority list of AMR pathogens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), an acid-fast bacillus that causes tuberculosis (TB), merits being one of the highest priority pathogens on this list since drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) accounts for approximately 29% of deaths attributable to AMR. In recent years, funded collaborative efforts of researchers from academia, not-for-profit virtual R&D organizations and industry have resulted in the continuous growth of the TB drug discovery and development pipeline. This has so far led to the accelerated regulatory approval of bedaquiline and delamanid for the treatment of DR-TB. However, despite the availability of drug regimes, the current cure rate for multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) treatment regimens is 50% and 30%, respectively. It is to be noted that these regimens are administered over a long duration and have a serious side effect profile. Coupled with poor patient adherence, this has led to further acquisition of drug resistance and treatment failure. There is therefore an urgent need to develop new TB drugs with novel mechanism of actions (MoAs) and associated regimens.This Account recapitulates drug resistance in TB, existing challenges in addressing DR-TB, new drugs and regimens in development, and potential ways to treat DR-TB. We highlight our research aimed at identifying novel small molecule leads and associated targets against TB toward contributing to the global TB drug discovery and development pipeline. Our work mainly involves screening of various small molecule chemical libraries in phenotypic whole-cell based assays to identify hits for medicinal chemistry optimization, with attendant deconvolution of the MoA. We discuss the identification of small molecule chemotypes active against Mtb and subsequent structure-activity relationships (SAR) and MoA deconvolution studies.

Despite of largest number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis cases (1, 30,000; 27% of the global burden), strains responsible for the expansion or development of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections have been poorly characterized in India. Present study was aimed to investigate the genetic diversity in MDR isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in North India. RESULTS: Spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) was performed on 293 clinical MDR isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis recovered from cases of pulmonary tuberculosis from North India. Spoligotyping identified 74 distinct spoligotype patterns. Comparison with an international spoligotype database (spoldb4 database) showed that 240 (81.91%) and 32 (10.92%) strains displayed known and shared type patterns, while 21 (7.16%) strains displayed unique spoligotype patterns. Among the phylogeographic lineages, lineage 3 (East African-Indian) was found most predominant lineage (n = 159, 66.25%), followed by lineage 2 (East Asian; n = 34, 14.16%), lineage 1 (Indo-Oceanic; n = 30, 12.50%) and lineage 4 (Euro American; n = 17, 7.08%). Overall, CAS1_DEL (60.41%; SITs 2585, 26, 2694, 309, 381, 428, 1401, 141, 25, 1327) was found most pre-dominant spoligotype pattern followed by Beijing (14.16%; SITs255, 260, 1941, 269) and EAI3_IND (5.00%; SITs 298, 338, 11). The demographic and clinical characteristics were not found significantly associated with genotypic lineages of MDR-M.tuberculosis isolates recovered from pulmonary TB patients of North India. CONCLUSIONS: Present study reveals high genetic diversity among the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates and highlights that SIT141/CAS1_Del followed by SIT26/ Beijing lineage is the most common spoligotype responsible for the development and transmission of MDR-TB in North India. The high presence of shared type and unique spoligotype patterns of MDR strains indicates epidemiological significance of locally evolved strains in ongoing transmission of MDR-TB within this community which needs to be further monitored using robust molecular tools with high discriminatory power.",1471-2180 (Electronic) 1471-2180 (Linking),2021 Apr 21,,"['10.1186/s12866-021-02174-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12866-021-02174-6 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['CAS1_DEL lineage', 'Multidrug resistant', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'North India', 'Spoligotyping']",,,

During the study period, the rate of resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was 5.4%, 0.4%, 1.1%, and 1.1%, respectively. All phenotypically resistant isolates (14 to isoniazid, 3 to ethambutol, 3 to pyrazinamide, and 1 to rifampicin) and 17 susceptible isolates (control group) were tested for the presence of mutations/alterations/polymorphisms by PCR followed by sequencing analysis. The molecular typing of isolates was based on multispacer sequence typing. Despite the phenotypic resistance, mutations were detected in 13 of 21 isolates (11 isoniazid resistant, 1 rifampicin, and 1 pyrazinamide resistant). Four isoniazid-resistant strains carried the most common mutations S315T and C-15T, whereas the remaining seven isolates carried either less known (E399, A162, W477STOP, S94A, G-48A, C-54T, C-17T, L203, A196, S124, and K367) or novel (D74N, G691S, Ains-85, and D171G); none of the susceptible strains was found to be positive for any novel mutation. The two single rifampicin- and pyrazinamide-resistant strains carried the known mutations S450L (also referred as S531L) and L182W, respectively. The presence of uncommon or novel mutations conferring resistance to isoniazid (INH) creates a diagnostic problem in the routine microbiological laboratory, since commercial methods are focused on the detection of the most common mechanisms of resistance (S315T, C-15T, A-16G, T-8C, and T-8A), therefore, fail to detect such strains.

In this study, we compared conventional DST performed in Minsk, Belarus, a TB DR high-burden country, with extensive geno- and phenotypic analyses performed at the WHO TB Supranational Reference Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark, for TB/HIV coinfected patients. Subsequently, DST results were related to treatment regimen and outcome. Methods: Thirty TB/HIV coinfected patients from Minsk were included and descriptive statistics applied. Results: Based on results from Minsk, 10 (33%) TB/HIV patients had drug-sensitive TB. Two (7%) had isoniazid monoresistant TB, 8 (27%) had multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, 5 (17%) preextensive drug-resistant (preXDR) TB, and 5 (17%) had extensive drug-resistant (XDR) TB. For the first-line drugs rifampicin and isoniazid, there was DST agreement between Minsk and Copenhagen for 90% patients. For the second-line anti-TB drugs, discrepancies were more pronounced. For 14 (47%) patients, there were disagreements for at least one drug, and 4 (13%) patients were classified as having MDR-TB in Minsk but were classified as having preXDR-TB based on DST results in Copenhagen. Initially, all patients received standard anti-TB treatment with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. However, this was only suitable for 40% of the patients based on DST. On average, DR-TB patients were changed to 4 (IQR 3-5) active drugs after 1.5 months (IQR 1-2). After treatment adjustment, the treatment duration was 8 months (IQR 2-11). Four (22%) patients with DR-TB received treatment for >18 months. In total, sixteen (53%) patients died during 24 months of follow-up. Conclusions: We found high concordance for rifampicin and isoniazid DST between the Minsk and Copenhagen laboratories, whereas discrepancies for second-line drugs were more pronounced. For patients with DR-TB, treatment was often insufficient and relevant adjustments delayed. This example from Minsk, Belarus, underlines two crucial points in the management of DR-TB: the urgent need for implementation of rapid molecular DSTs and availability of second-line drugs in all DR-TB high-burden settings. Carefully designed individualized treatment regimens in accordance with DST patterns will likely improve patients' outcome and reduce transmission with drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.",2090-150X (Print) 2090-150X (Linking),2021,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3187-0597'],['10.1155/2021/6646239 [doi]'],['eng'],Egypt,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Daria N.

To investigate the role of disputed rpoB mutations in M. tuberculosis and TB treatment outcomes, initial isolates of 837 clinical RR or MDR-TB cases confirmed during 2014-2018 were retested using agar-based RIF pDST and rpoB gene sequencing. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for isolates with disputed rpoB mutations. Disputed rpoB mutations were identified in 77 (9.2%) M. tuberculosis isolates, including 50 (64.9%) and 14 (18.2%) phenotypic RIF- and rifabutin (RFB)-resistant isolates, respectively. The predominant single mutations were L533P (44.2%) and L511P (20.8%). Most of the isolates harboring L511P (87.5%), H526N (100%), D516Y (70.0%) and L533P (63.6%) mutations had MICs </=1 mg/L, whereas isolates harboring H526L (75%) had MICs > 1 mg/L. Of the 63 cases with treatment outcomes, 11 (17.5%) cases died, 1 (1.6%) case transferred out and 51 (81%) cases had favorable outcomes, including 8 and 20 cases treated with standard-dose RIF- and RFB-containing regimens, respectively.

METHODS: Mixture, magnesium oxide nanoparticles (NPs) and zinc oxide (MgONPs-ZnONPs) were prepared. The microplate alamar blue (MABA) assay and the proportion method were used to evaluate of anti-tubercular activity against MDR-MTB. MTT test was done to MgONPs-ZnONPs against Vero and HepG2 cell lines. RESULTS: The MIC of MgONPs and ZnONPs were 0.195 and 0.468 mug mL(-1) against 10(4) of H37Rv Mtb. As well, 0.166 mug mL(-1) of MgONPs-ZnONPs was able to inhibit 10(-4) H37Rv Mtb. The MIC of MgONPs against 10(4) concentrations of MDR-Mtb was 12.5 mug mL(-1). The MIC of MgONPs/ZnONPs against 10(4) concentrations of MDR-Mtb reached to 0.664 mug mL(-1). The MBC value of ZnONPs increased to 1.875 mug mL(-1) against 10(-4) concentrations of MDR-Mtb. Testing showed that the MBCs of MgONPs/ZnONPs reached to 1.328 mug mL(-1) against 10(4) concentrations of MDR-Mtb. The IC50 against MDR-TB was 0.779 mug mL(-1) for ZnONPs and 0.883 mug mL(-1) for MgONPs-ZnONPs. The MgONPs-ZnONPs was not toxic to Vero cell lines however ZnONPs could inhibit the Vero and HepG2 cell lines.

To start clinical trial phase I at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in collaboration with the Japanese group, this preclinical setting study aimed to evaluate the proliferative efficacy of the method, the activation status of expanded autologous NK cells, and the likely unwanted contamination of the final cell product. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 5 healthy individuals' peripheral blood and transferred directly to the specified initial culture bag containing anti-CD52 and anti-CD3 and Interleukin (IL)-2. The cells were cultured for 14-17 days in an incubator, during which the cells received condition media, and underwent several passages into bigger culture bags. All the procedures were carried out in a cleanroom and associated facilities. Before and after activation PBMCs were analyzed for their phenotype and cytotoxic activity; using flow cytometry and cytokine release assay. Our results indicated that NK (CD3-CD16+/-CD56+) cells were expanded 510-fold on average (range 200-1100 fold), and the purity of NK cells per whole lymphocytes exceeded 68%. The expanded cells were highly lytic as indicated by in-vitro cytotoxic assay, with a strong expression of Natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) and CD16.

Although there is reported evidence that some mycoplasmas can develop biofilms little is known about any differences in metabolism in these organisms between the growth states. A systematic metabolomics approach may help clarify differences associated between planktonic and biofilm associated mycoplasmas. In the current study, the metabolomics of two different mycoplasmas of clinical importance (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma fermentans) were examined using a novel approach involving nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and principle component analysis. Characterisation of metabolic changes was facilitated through the generation of high-density metabolite data and diffusion-ordered spectroscopy that provided the size and structural information of the molecules under examination. This enabled the discrimination between biofilms and planktonic states for the metabolomic profiles of both organisms. This work identified clear biofilm/planktonic differences in metabolite composition for both clinical mycoplasmas and the outcomes serve to establish a baseline understanding of the changes in metabolism observed in these pathogens in their different growth states. This may offer insight into how these organisms are capable of exploiting and persisting in different niches and so facilitate their survival in the clinical setting.",2045-2322 (Electronic) 2045-2322 (Linking),2021 Mar 11,,"['10.1038/s41598-021-84326-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-84326-2 [pii]']",['eng'],England,,,,

Among the causes recently cited are chronic infections engendered by microorganisms that often go unnoticed. A typical illustration of such a case is infection due to mollicutes bacteria. Generally known by their lurking nature, urogenital mollicutes are the most incriminated in PCa. This study was thus carried out in an attempt to establish the presence of these mollicutes by PCR in biopsies of confirmed PCa patients and to evaluate their prevalence. METHODS: A total of 105 Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded prostate tissues collected from 50 patients suffering from PCa and 55 with benign prostate hyperplasia were subjected to PCR amplification targeting species-specific genes of 5 urogenital mollicutes species, Mycoplasma genitalium, M. hominis, M. fermentans, Ureaplasma parvum, and U. urealyticum. PCR products were then sequenced to confirm species identification. Results significance was statistically assessed using Chi-square and Odds ratio tests. RESULTS: PCR amplification showed no positive results for M. genitalium, M. hominis, and M. fermentans in all tested patients. Strikingly, Ureaplasma spp. were detected among 30% (15/50) of PCa patients. Nucleotide sequencing further confirmed the identified ureaplasma species, which were distributed as follows: 7 individuals with only U. parvum, 5 with only U. urealyticum, and 3 co-infection cases. Association of the two ureaplasma species with PCa cases proved statistically significant (P < 0.05), and found to represent a risk factor. Of note, Ureaplasma spp. were mostly identified in patients aged 60 and above with prostatic specific antigen (PSA) level > 4 ng/ml and an invasive malignant prostate tumor (Gleason score 8-10). CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovered a significant association of Ureaplasma spp. with PCa arguing in favour of their potential involvement in this condition.

Our aim was to obtain a better characterization of the inflammasome-dependent inflammation processes in these tissues, with a particular focus on the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor, pyrin domain containing protein 7 (NLRP7) inflammasome. Methods: The presence of NLRP7 inflammasome actors [NLRP7, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain (ASC), and caspase-1] was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in human amnion and choriodecidua at the three trimesters and at term. The protein concentrations were then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in term tissues, with or without labor. The presence of Mycoplasma salivarium and Mycoplasma fermentans in human fetal membranes was investigated using a PCR approach. Human amnion epithelial cells (AECs) were treated for 4 or 20 h with fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1), a M. salivarium-derived ligand. Transcripts and proteins quantity was then measured by RT-quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. NLRP7 and ASC colocalization was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Western blots allowed analysis of pro-caspase-1 and gasdermin D cleavage. Results: NLRP7, ASC, and caspase-1 transcripts were expressed in both sheets of human fetal membranes during all pregnancy stages, but only ASC protein expression was increased with labor. In addition, M. salivarium and M. fermentans were detected for the first time in human fetal membranes. NLRP7 and caspase-1 transcripts, as well as NLRP7, ASC, and pro-caspase-1 protein levels, were increased in FSL-1-treated AECs. The NLRP7 inflammasome assembled around the nucleus, and pro-caspase-1 and gasdermin D were cleaved into their mature forms after FSL-1 stimulation.

The present study aims to systematically review reported studies on M. fermentans and its association with HIV-1 infection, as well as to summarize the findings using a meta-analysis. METHODS: Studies meeting the inclusion criteria in the PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data, and Chongqing VIP databases up to March 2019 were identified. Cochran Q and I statistics were used to assess heterogeneity. Additionally, pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and displayed by Forest plots. Also, the funnel plot, Begg test, and Egger test were used to evaluate potential publication bias. In addition, the source of heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: A total of 11 studies comprising 1028 HIV-1-positive patients and 1298 controls were ultimately included in this meta-analysis.

As they can substantially alter cell metabolism and potentially spread to all cell cultures in laboratory, their early detection is necessary. One of the fastest and cheapest methods of mycoplasma detection relies on the direct staining of mycoplasmas' DNA by DAPI or Hoechst dyes. Although this method is easy and fast to perform, it suffers from the low signal provided by these dyes compared to the nuclear DNA. Therefore, the reporter cell lines are used for cultivation of mycoplasmas before DAPI or the Hoechst staining step. In the study presented, we have developed and tested a new immunofluorescence assay for the detection of mycoplasmas. The method is based on the enzymatic labeling using DNA polymerase I and modified nucleotides utilizing nicks in the mycoplasmas' DNA. Modified nucleotides are incorporated into mycoplasmas' DNA and subsequently visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. The developed approach is independent of the mycoplasma strain, does not intensely stain nuclear DNA, does not stain other bacteria, and provides higher sensitivity than the approach based on the direct labeling using DAPI or Hoechst dyes.",2073-4409 (Electronic) 2073-4409 (Linking),2019 Nov 25,,"['cells8121510 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8121510 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['*cell cultures', '*immunofluorescence detection', '*mycoplasma infection']",,"['EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'Mycoplasma arginini']","['A549 Cells', 'DNA Polymerase I/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Mycoplasma/*isolation & purification', 'Mycoplasma Infections/*microbiology', 'Mycoplasma fermentans/*isolation & purification', 'Mycoplasma hominis/*isolation & purification', 'Staining and Labeling']"

The Mollicutes class unites cell wall lacking bacteria many of which are membrane parasites and opportunistic bacteria.Aim. This study describes a novel morphological form found in the five species belonging to the bacterial class Mollicutes, and referred to as microcolonies (MCs).Methodology. MCs were obtained as described below and characterized with bacteriological and immunological methods, and microscopy.Results. In contrast to typical colonies (TCs), MCs are characterized by tiny propeller-shaped colonies formed by rod-like cells tightly packed in parallel rows. These colonies were observed within routinely cultivated cultures of type strains 7-12 days post-plating. Rod-like cells were visualized using a scanning electron microscope within TCs with a 'fried-egg-like' appearance. MCs were not observed to revert to TCs. MCs were resistant to antibiotics and other treatments effective against TCs. Pure MC cultures were generated in vitro by treatment of Mycoplasma cultures with hyperimmune serum, antibiotics or argon non-thermal plasma. MCs of Mycoplasma hominis strain H-34 were characterized in detail to confirm that they belonged to that species. MCs tested positive via PCR with M. hominis-specific primers, direct fluorescence and epifluorescence tests, and Western blotting with the camel-derived nanobody aMh-FcG2a, which is specific to the MH3620 transporter protein. Meanwhile, MCs behaved differently in standard bacteriological tests. Pure MC cultures were also isolated directly from clinical samples of the serum, synovial liquid and urine of patients within flammatory urogenital tract diseases, asthma or arthritis. In total, 79 independent MC cultures were isolated from clinical samples including M. hominis (n=70), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=2), Mycoplasma fermentans (n=2) and Mycoplasma spp. (n=5).Conclusion.

Additionally, mycoplasma infection in vitro reduces p53 activity. Immunoprecipitation of p53 in mycoplasma-infected cells identified several mycoplasma proteins, including DnaK, a member of the Hsp70 chaperon family. We focused on DnaK because of its ability to interact with proteins. We demonstrate that mycoplasma DnaK interacts with and reduces the activities of human proteins involved in critical cellular pathways, including DNA-PK and PARP1, which are required for efficient DNA repair, and binds to USP10 (a key p53 regulator), impairing p53-dependent anticancer functions. This also reduced the efficacy of anticancer drugs that depend on p53 to exert their effect. mycoplasma was detected early in the infected mice, but only low copy numbers of mycoplasma DnaK DNA sequences were found in some primary and secondary tumors, pointing toward a hit-and-run/hide mechanism of transformation. Uninfected bystander cells took up exogenous DnaK, suggesting a possible paracrine function in promoting malignant transformation, over and above cells infected with the mycoplasma. Phylogenetic amino acid analysis shows that other bacteria associated with human cancers have similar DnaKs, consistent with a common mechanism of cellular transformation mediated through disruption of DNA-repair mechanisms, as well as p53 dysregulation, that also results in cancer-drug resistance.

Short proteolytic products including macrophage-activating lipopeptide 2 (MALP2) have been utilized as antitumor immune-enhancing adjuvants. We have chemically synthesized a short form of MALP2 named MALP2s (S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]-CGNNDE). MALP2 and MALP2s provoke natural killer (NK) cell activation in vitro but only poorly induce tumor regression using in vivo mouse models loading NK-sensitive tumors. Here, we identified the functional mechanism of MALP2s on dendritic cell (DC)-priming and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-dependent tumor eradication using CTL-sensitive tumor-implant models EG7 and B16-OVA. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade therapy in combination with MALP2s + ovalbumin (OVA) showed a significant additive effect on tumor growth suppression. MALP2s increased co-stimulators CD80/86 and CD40, which were totally MyD88-dependent, with no participation of toll-IL-1R homology domain-containing adaptor molecule-1 or type I interferon signaling in DC priming. MALP2s + OVA consequently augmented proliferation of OVA-specific CTLs in the spleen and at tumor sites. Chemokines and cytolytic factors were upregulated in the tumor. Strikingly, longer duration and reinvigoration of CTLs in spleen and tumors were accomplished by the addition of MALP2s + OVA to alpha-PD-L1 antibody (Ab) therapy compared to alpha-PD-L1 Ab monotherapy. Then, tumors regressed better in the MALP2s/OVA combination than in the alpha-PD-L1 Ab monotherapy. Hence, MALP2s/tumor-associated antigens combined with alpha-PD-L1 Ab is a good therapeutic strategy in some mouse models. Unfortunately, numerous patients are still resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, and good DC-priming adjuvants are desired.

Induction of apoptosis in porcine alveolar macrophages is an important pathogenic mechanism of M. hyo. Cholesterol has been reported to influence cell adherence and cell invasion of Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma fermentans leading to apoptosis, but the role of cholesterol on the apoptotic inducing activity of M. hyo remains unknown. In this study, we found a positive correlation between cholesterol level and M. hyo infection in porcine serum and lung tissue. Cholesterol exacerbated M. hyo-induced apoptosis in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in a dosage-dependent manner, which was associated with increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) production, up-regulated TNF-alpha mRNA expression, and activated caspase-3. The pathogenicity-enhancing effect of cholesterol was related to increased M. hyo proliferation with an up-regulation of M. hyo genes responsible for DNA and protein synthesis, which led to improved M. hyo adherence to PAMs, presumably via increased mRNA expression of adhesin genes.

The genital mycoplasmas, Mycoplasma genitalium and Ureaplasma urealyticum, are associated with various infectious diseases in adults and infants. The objective of our study is to identify differences in cytokine profile and Lactobacillus species dominance between a study group of non-pregnant pre-menopausal women with genital M. genitalium or U. urealyticum colonization and a control group of non-pregnant pre-menopausal women without genital M. genitalium or U. urealyticum colonization. METHODS: A real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to measure Lactobacillus species in vaginal swab samples. Cytokine analysis was performed using multiplex immunoassay techniques. Analysis of variance confirmed a significant difference in cytokine profiles between patient groups, with t-tests identifying the most significantly different cytokines. Categorical data analysis identified significant patterns of relative Lactobacillus species dominance in the study group. RESULTS: Lactobacillus iners was the predominant Lactobacillus species in the control group (p = 0.005). There were no dominant Lactobacillus species observed in the study group. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (p = 0.002), interleukin-8 (p = 0.001), and interleukin-1beta (p = 0.049) were expressed significantly higher in the study group, whereas interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (p < 0.001), interleukin-10 (p = 0.001), interleukin-12 (p = 0.002), and interferon-gamma (p = 0.022) were expressed higher in the control group. Association matrices for cytokines were significantly different between two groups (p < 0.001), with mostly negative associations in the control group and mostly positive associations in the study group. CONCLUSION: Cytokine levels, their associations, and the patterns of Lactobacillus species dominance are observed to significantly diverge on the basis of M. genitalium and U. urealyticum colonization among non-pregnant pre-menopausal women.",1745-5065 (Electronic) 1745-5057 (Linking),2021 Jan-Dec,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8067-7342'],['10.1177/17455065211009181 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['Lactobacillus', 'cytokine', 'genital infections', 'mycoplasma', 'vaginal microbiome']",,,

In this cross-sectional study, we determined the current prevalence of M. genitalium infection and the rate of macrolide resistance in M. genitalium isolates, in patients visiting two large Dutch sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics, to evaluate whether the recommendations in Dutch guidelines should be revised. In addition, risk factors for M. genitalium were identified. In total, 3225 patients were included. M. genitalium prevalence rates were 13.8% for all patients; 20.1% for men who have sex with men, 8.2% for men who have sex with women, and 12.6% for women. Macrolide resistance-associated mutations were detected in 66% of the patients infected with M. genitalium. Age, educational level, country of origin, number of sexual partners, HIV-positivity, infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and urethral symptoms in men were independently associated with M. genitalium infection.

Currently, guidelines do not recommend screening asymptomatic men who have sex with men (MSM). We developed a mathematical model of MG transmission to examine the impact of various screening strategies on the incidence and prevalence of MG among MSM attending a sexual health clinic. Methods: A compartmental mathematical model of MG transmission among MSM was constructed and calibrated using data from the Melbourne Sexual Health center, where resistance-guided therapy provides high treatment effectiveness (92-95%). The model stratified men by symptom status, sexual risk behaviours and whether or not they had MG with macrolide resistance. We simulated the impact on endemic steady-state MG prevalence and incidence of the following screening scenarios, namely screening: 1) no MSM; 2) only symptomatic MSM (the current recommendation); 3) all symptomatic and high-risk asymptomatic MSM; and 4) all MSM. Our base case analysis assumed a treatment effectiveness of 92-95% using resistance-guided therapy. We also examined the impact of treatment effectiveness (i.e. the proportion of detected MG that were cured) and screening coverage (i.e. testing rate) on MG prevalence. Findings: The model predicts that the overall endemic MG prevalence is 9.1% (95% CI: 7.9-10.0) in the current situation where screening is only offered to symptomatic MSM (base-case). This would increase to 11.4% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 10.2-13.7) if no MSM are offered screening, but would decrease to 7.3% (95% CI: 5.7-8.4) if all symptomatic and high-risk asymptomatic MSM were offered screening and 6.4% (95% CI: 4.7-7.7) if all MSM were offered screening. Increasing coverage of MSM screening strategies shows a similar effect on decreasing endemic MG incidence. When evaluating the simultaneous impact of treatment effectiveness and screening coverage, we found that offering screening to more MSM may reduce the overall prevalence but leads to a higher proportion of macrolide-resistant MG, particularly when using treatment regimens with lower effectiveness. Interpretation: Based on the available treatment options, offering screening for MG to other MSM (beyond the currently recommended group of symptomatic MSM) could slightly reduce the prevalence and incidence of MG. However, further increasing screening coverage must be weighed against the impact of lower treatment effectiveness (i.e. when not using resistance-guided therapy), increasing the selection of macrolide resistance, and other negative consequences related to AMR and management (e.g. unnecessary psychological morbidity from infections that do not need treatment).",2589-5370 (Electronic) 2589-5370 (Linking),2021 Mar,,"['10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100779 [doi]', 'S2589-5370(21)00059-6 [pii]']",['eng'],England,,['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],,

Genital mycoplasmas, such as Mycoplasma hominis and M. genitalium, are most frequently associated with several adverse effects on men&amp;rsquo;s fertility. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of M. hominis and M. genitalium in the semen samples in thenortheast of Iran. During thiscross-sectional study from February to May, 2018, 100 semen samples were collected from 100 infertile men in Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi province, northeast of Iran. The presence of M. hominis and M. genitalium was detected by cultivation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Multiplex PCR assays. The colony of mycoplasma was confirmed by Diene&amp;rsquo;s stain; moreover, arginine hydrolysis, glucose, and urea utilization were evaluated. The following semen indices were analyzed according to World Health Organization guidelines for semen analysis: color, volume, appearance, liquefaction, viscosity, concentration, pH, leukocyte concentration, progressive motility, morphological normality, motile sperm concentration, functional sperm concentration, sperm motility index, and functional sperm. The gene of 16SrRNA (GPO1&amp;amp; MGSO primers) was used as the target gene of the Mycoplasma genus in PCR assay. Multiplex-PCR was performed with a specific primer for conserved regions in the 16SrRNA gene for M. hominis (RNAH1&amp;amp; RNAH2 primers) and the 140-kDa Adhesion Protein Gene for M. genitalium (MG1 &amp;amp; MG2 primers).According to the results,9 (9%) samples were PCR-positive for Mycoplasma spp , while there were 7 (7%) cases isolated by cultivation. M. hominis was detected in 8 (8%) samples by Multiplex PCR, while there was no evidence for M. genitalium. The mean age scores of all infertile and infected men were obtained at 31 and 30 years, respectively. The study could not show any statistical correlation between mycoplasma infection and abnormal semen parameters. The heterogeneity of mycoplasma prevalence in the reports can be ascribed to differences in geographic areas, the sensitivity of the identification method, condition of the group (fertile/infertile), sample size, and operator proficiency.

However, current laboratory methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, or require specialized laboratory instruments. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) technology is a rapidly developing field because of the significance for clinical application and commercial value. Few studies have reported the use of RPA to detect MH. In this study, we developed the rapid MH detection assay, which may be potentially used as a sensitive point-of-care testing (POCT) in clinic. METHODS: Primers based on the MH 16SrRNA gene and gap gene were explored and screened out. The probe of RPA-LFD was designed based on the optimal primer and confirmed. The reaction conditions of temperature and time for RPA were optimized. The sensitivity and specificity of the analysis were explored. A total of 60 clinical specimens were used to verify the efficiency of the two methods. RESULTS: The optimal reaction conditions were determined as 15 minutes and 39 degrees C. The sensitivity of RPA was 10-6 ng for MH, which is 100,000 times more sensitive than traditional PCR. Moreover, we observed another six non-target reproductive tract common pathogens without amplification products. Furthermore, we found that there was no significant difference between RPA and the cultivation method (p > 0.05). These two methods were in good agreement (kappa = 0.938) when detecting clinical specimens. CONCLUSIONS: A new method for sensitive and rapid detection of MH based on RPA was successfully developed, which can be applied in large-scale screening and as a supplementary method to classical methods.",1433-6510 (Print) 1433-6510 (Linking),2021 Apr 1,,['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200826 [doi]'],['eng'],Germany,,,,

METHODS: A total of 1448 individuals with urogenital symptoms underwent mycoplasma testing between April 2016 and March 2020. Detection, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were carried out using Mycoplasma ID/AST kits. RESULTS: The total infection rate of genital mycoplasmas was 37.5% (543/1448 cases) with an observed increase over the past 4 years. The positive rates of all three detected infections, as well as overall infection rate, were significantly higher in females than in males (P < 0.05). A higher positive rate of infection was observed in females aged 25-29 (60.5%), and in the 15-19 years age group (57.7%). The changes observed among all age groups of females were statistically significantly different (P < 0.001). The positive rates of U. urealyticum and M. hominis co-infection among the four seasons during which the survey was carried out were also observed to be statistically different (P = 0.01). More than 70% of U. urealyticum isolates were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin, and more than 80% of M. hominis isolates were resistant to erythromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin. Josamycin, doxycycline and minocycline were most effective against U. urealyticum and M. hominis. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study found increasing rates of U. urealyticum and M. hominis infection over the past 4 years, particularly among younger age groups.

However, the microbial composition of the respiratory tract and other infected tissues as well as their possible pathogenic contributions to varying degrees of disease severity in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. Between 27 January and 26 February 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients in Guangdong province, China. Total RNA was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. We identified distinct signatures of microbial dysbiosis among severely ill COVID-19 patients on broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Co-detection of other human respiratory viruses (including human alphaherpesvirus 1, rhinovirus B, and human orthopneumovirus) was demonstrated in 30.8% (4/13) of the severely ill patients, but not in any of the mildly affected patients. Notably, the predominant respiratory microbial taxa of severely ill patients were Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC), Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Mycoplasma spp. (including M. hominis and M. orale).

Finally, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes was demonstrated in one severely ill patient, which might accelerate his disease deterioration and death occurring one month after ICU admission. Our findings point to SARS-CoV-2-related microbial dysbiosis and various antibiotic-resistant respiratory microbes/pathogens in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity.

In addition, the endosymbiosis of Mycoplasma hominis (M. hominis) and T. vaginalis virus (TVV) in the isolates was also examined. Methods: The allele sizes for each locus were calculated and microsatellite types were determined according to the allele profiles. The population structure was examined with Bayesian clustering method. A website (http://mttype.adu.edu.tr) was created for collection and sharing of microsatellite data. Presence of TVV and M. hominis in T. vaginalis isolates were investigated with electrophoresis and PCR. Results: Of 630 vaginal samples T. vaginalis was detected in 30 (4.7%) and those were used for further analysis. The structure produced by a clustering algorithm revealed eight genetic groups. The typing of isolates according to microsatellites revealed 23 different microsatellite types. Three clones were determined among isolates (MT10 16.7%; MT18 10% and MT3 6.7%).

The aminotransferase domain of MpMetRS is capable of generating methionine from its alpha-keto acid analog, 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (KMTB). The methionine thus produced can be subsequently attached to cognate tRNA(Met) in the MpMetRS aminoacylation domain. Genomic erosion in the Mycoplasma species has impaired many canonical biosynthetic pathways, causing them to rely on their host for numerous metabolites. It is still unclear if this bifunctional MetRS is a key part of pathogen life cycle or is a neutral consequence of the reductive evolution experienced by Mycoplasma species.",2073-4425 (Electronic) 2073-4425 (Linking),2020 Nov 7,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4550-5988', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9159-6991']","['genes11111320 [pii]', '10.3390/genes11111320 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['aminoacylation', 'aminotransferase', 'bifunctional', 'channeling', 'pyridoxal phosphate', 'tRNA']",,,

We estimated associations between urethral bacteria and NGU in men who have sex with men (MSM) and men who have sex with women (MSW). METHODS: Urine was collected from NGU cases (129 MSM; 121 MSW) and controls (70 MSM; 114 MSW) attending a Seattle STD clinic. Cases had >/=5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Gram stain plus symptoms or discharge; controls had <5 PMNs, no symptoms, no discharge. NGU was considered idiopathic when Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis, adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus were absent. The urethral microbiota was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Compositional lasso analysis was conducted to identify associations between bacterial taxa and NGU, and to select bacteria for targeted quantitative PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Among NGU cases, 45.2% were idiopathic. Based on compositional lasso analysis, we selected Haemophilus influenzae (HI) and Mycoplasma penetrans (MP) for targeted qPCR. Compared to 182 men without NGU, the 249 men with NGU were more likely to have HI (14% vs. 2%) and MP (21% vs. 1%) (both p</=0.001). In stratified analyses, detection of HI was associated with NGU among MSM (12% vs. 3%, p=0.036) and MSW (17% vs. 1%, p<0.001), but MP was associated with NGU only among MSM (13% vs. 1%, p=0.004).

Mycoplasma penetrans, a species of Mycoplasma sp., has been frequently detected in HIV-positive patients and associated with the progression of HIV-associated disease. To date, there is only a single case report describing M. penetrans as the causative agent of a severe respiratory tract infection in a HIV-negative patient. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we describe the case of M. penetrans bacteremia in a HIV-negative, 38-year-old, female, immunocompromised, solid organ transplant patient (combined kidney and pancreas transplantation in 2016), who was admitted to our hospital with anemic uterine bleeding and fever of 38.3 degrees C. Several hours before her admission at our university hospital, a latex bladder catheter was inserted into her uterus and she complained about fatigue, dizziness and ongoing vaginal bleeding. Laboratory examination showed severe anemia, but microbiological examination was inconspicuous (culture negative vaginal and cervical smears, negative urine culture). Bacterial blood cultures showed a growth signal after 4 h, but microscopic examination with Gram staining and subcultures on different agar media did not identify bacterial pathogens. To identify the bacterial cause of malignancy in the patient, metagenomic sequencing of the blood culture was performed that identified M. penetrans. CONCLUSION: Metagenomic sequencing identified M. penetrans in an immunosuppressed patient with culture-negative bacteremia. Clinicians should be aware of the opportunistic potential of M. penetrans that may cause severe infections in certain vulnerable patient populations and the limitations of culture and Gram staining for confirming the presence of fastidious bacterial pathogens like Mycoplasma spp.",1471-2334 (Electronic) 1471-2334 (Linking),2020 Jan 3,,"['10.1186/s12879-019-4723-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-019-4723-7 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Bacteremia', 'Immune deficiency', 'Metagenomic sequencing', 'Mycoplasma penetrans']",,,"['Adult', 'Bacteremia/*diagnosis/genetics/microbiology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/immunology/therapy', 'Female', 'HIV Seronegativity', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Metagenome', '*Metagenomics/methods', 'Mycoplasma Infections/*diagnosis/genetics/microbiology', '*Mycoplasma penetrans/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Pancreas Transplantation', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*diagnosis/genetics/microbiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']"

In an effort to improve the stability and solubility of complementing fragments of the two MTases, genes encoding circularly permuted (CP) variants of M.MpeI and M.SssI were created, and cloned in a plasmid vector downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter. MTase activity of the CP variants was tested by digestion of the plasmids with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Eleven of the fourteen M.MpeI permutants and six of the seven M.SssI permutants had detectable MTase activity as indicated by the full or partial protection of the plasmid carrying the cpMTase gene. Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work.",1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),2018,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7356-2264', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8213-7745', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7975-3085']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0197232 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-02857 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']","['Bacterial Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*chemistry/genetics', '*Databases, Protein', 'Mycoplasma penetrans/*enzymology/genetics', 'Spiroplasma/*enzymology/genetics', 'Substrate Specificity']"

These tumours are most often seen in older fish and are classified as small cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas. Affected fish populations always contain subpopulations with preneoplastic lesions, characterized by epithelial hyperplasia or inflammation. Previous observations indicated that these tumours are unlikely caused by diet, water quality or genetic background, suggesting an infectious aetiology. We performed five transmission experiments by exposure of naive fish to affected donor fish by cohabitation or exposure to tank effluent water. Intestinal lesions were observed in recipient fish in all exposure groups, including transmissions from previous recipient fish, and moribund fish exhibited a higher prevalence of neoplasms. We found a single 16S rRNA sequence, most similar to Mycoplasma penetrans, to be highly enriched in the donors and exposed recipients compared to unexposed control fish. We further tracked the presence of the Mycoplasma sp. using a targeted PCR test on individual dissected intestines or faeces or tank faeces. Original donor and exposed fish populations were positive for Mycoplasma, while corresponding unexposed control fish were negative.

This paper compared for the first time the genomes of four human urogenital Mycoplasma species (M. penetrans HF-2, M. fermentans JER, M. genitalium G37 and M. hominis PG21) to categorise the metabolic functions of the core genes and to assess the effects of tandem repeats, phage-like genetic elements and prophages on the virulence genes. The results of this comparative in silico genomic analysis revealed that the genes constituting their core genomes can be separated into three distinct categories: nuclear metabolism, protein metabolism and energy generation each making up 52%, 31% and 23%, respectively. The genomes have repeat sequences ranging from 3.7% in M. hominis PG21 to 9.5% in M. fermentans JER. Tandem repeats (mostly minisatellites) and phage-like proteins (including DNA gyrases/topoisomerases) were randomly distributed in the Mycoplasma genomes. Here, we identified a coiled-coil structure containing protein in M. penetrans HF-2 which is significantly similar to the Mem protein of M. fermentans MFV1. Therefore, a Mycoplasma prophage seems to be embedded within M. penetrans HF-2 unannotated genome. To the best of our knowledge, no Mycoplasma phages or prophages have been detected in M. penetrans.

Methods: From June 28th, 2019 to March 23rd, 2020, we enrolled fifty-two children diagnosed with RMPP or non-refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia (NRMPP), and characterized the structure and function of microbiota in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). Results: Based on Bray-Curtis distance between samples, samples in RMPP group were highly homogeneous, and Shannon index in the RMPP group was much lower than NRMPP group while Simpson index, which presents the degree of dominance, was higher in RMPP group. The dominant taxon with relative abundance greater than 50% was merely Mycoplasma among RMPP and NRMPP patients, but the proportions of other taxonomic distribution were different. M. pneumoniae was the dominant species and occupied almost all niches in the vast majority of RMPP patients, whereas the other genera were dramatically lower. The NRMPP group was more enriched in antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) than the RMPP group, and also exhibited a greater relative abundance of macrolide antibiotics resistance gene (macB) and fluoroquinolone antibiotic resistance genes (patA-B) in M. pneumoniae genome. In RMPP patients, higher relative abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae had a strong correlation with increased hospitalization days while higher relative abundance of Streptococcus pneumoniae had a negative correlation with hospitalization days among NRMPP patients. Conclusions: The microbiota of LRT in children with RMPP was much more homogeneous and simpler than that of the NRMPP group and with lower relative abundance of macrolide antibiotics resistance gene in M. pneumoniae genome. M. pneumoniae was absolutely dominant in the vast majority of RMPP patients.

Due to its high rates of antibiotic resistance, vaccination has become the best method to control the dissemination of M. pneumoniae. The recombinant carboxyl terminus of the P1 (P1C) protein is an immunodominant antigen, but it has negative effects such as poor stability and lower purity. In the current study, T-B epitopes of the P1C protein were predicted according to bioinformatics analysis and assessed for efficacy in peptide vaccination. BALB/c mice were subcutaneously inoculated with the T-B epitope peptides four times and then infected with M. pneumoniae through the respiratory tract. The results showed that the T-B epitope peptides of the P1C protein (P1C103-117, P1C155-169, P1C224-238 and P1C244-258) induced strong antigen-specific serum antibody responses and cellular immune responses with high levels of serum IgG, IgA antibodies and Th1-biased (IFN-gamma and IL-2) cytokines. Immunization with T-B epitope peptides significantly reduced the M. pneumoniae burden and the degree of inflammation in the challenged mice. Furthermore, the levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the supernatants of lung homogenates were observably reduced compared to those in the PBS group. Overall, our findings demonstrate that T-B epitopes (P1C103-117, P1C155-169, P1C224-238 and P1C244-258) play significant roles in the P1C protein and can be used to induce powerful humoral and cellular immune responses to provide significant protection against M. pneumoniae pulmonary infection, which provides new insight into the design of potential multiepitope vaccines to prevent host infection by M. pneumoniae.",1878-3279 (Electronic) 0171-2985 (Linking),2021 Mar 24,,"['S0171-2985(21)00025-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2021.152077 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Mycoplasma pneumoniae', 'Protective immunity', 'Recombinant carboxyl terminus of P1 (P1C)', 'Respiratory infection', 'T-B cell epitope']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier GmbH.

IMD cases caused by penicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Neisseria meningitidis containing a ROB-1 beta-lactamase gene (blaROB-1) and a mutated DNA gyrase gene (gyrA), have been recently reported in the USA. METHODS: We examined 2097 meningococcal genomes collected through US population-based surveillance from January 2011-February 2020 to identify IMD cases caused by strains with blaROB-1 or gyrA-mediated resistance. Antimicrobial resistance was confirmed phenotypically. The US isolate genomes were compared to non-US isolate genomes containing blaROB-1. Interspecies transfer of ciprofloxacin resistance was assessed by comparing gyrA among Neisseria species. RESULTS: Eleven penicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were identified after December 2018; all were serogroup Y, sequence type 3587, clonal complex (CC) 23, and contained blaROB-1 and a T91I-containing gyrA allele. An additional 22 penicillin-resistant, blaROB-1-containing US isolates with wild-type gyrA were identified from 2013-2020. All 33 blaROB-1-containing isolates formed a single clade, along with 12 blaROB-1-containing isolates from six other countries. Two-thirds of blaROB-1-containing US isolates were from Hispanic individuals. Twelve additional ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates with gyrA T91 mutations were identified. Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates belonged to six CCs and contained 10 unique gyrA alleles; seven were similar or identical to alleles from N. lactamica or N. gonorrhoeae. CONCLUSIONS: Recent IMD cases caused by a dual resistant serogroup Y suggest changing antimicrobial resistance patterns in the USA. The emerging dual-resistance is due to acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance by beta-lactamase-containing N. meningitidis.

Findings will inform recommendations by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. METHODS: We searched five databases (to January 24, 2020), trial registries, conference proceedings, and reference lists for English and French literature published since 1996. Screening, study selection, and risk of bias assessments were independently undertaken by two reviewers, with consensus for final decisions. Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and checked by another for accuracy and completeness. Meta-analysis was conducted where appropriate. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. The Task Force and content experts provided input on determining thresholds for important effect sizes and on interpretation of findings. RESULTS: Of 41 included studies, 17 and 11 reported on benefits and harms of screening, respectively, and 14 reported on patient preferences. Universal screening for CT in general populations 16 to 29 years of age, using population-based or opportunistic approaches achieving low screening rates, may make little-to-no difference for a female's risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (2 RCTs, n=141,362; 0.3 more in 1000 [7.6 fewer to 11 more]) or ectopic pregnancy (1 RCT, n=15,459; 0.20 more per 1000 [2.2 fewer to 3.9 more]). It may also not make a difference for CT transmission (3 RCTs, n=41,709; 3 fewer per 1000 [11.5 fewer to 6.9 more]). However, benefits may be achieved for reducing PID if screening rates are increased (2 trials, n=30,652; 5.7 fewer per 1000 [10.8 fewer to 1.1 more]), and for reducing CT and NG transmission when intensely screening high-prevalence female populations (2 trials, n=6127; 34.3 fewer per 1000 [4 to 58 fewer]; NNS 29 [17 to 250]). Evidence on infertility in females from CT screening and on transmission of NG in males and both sexes from screening for CT and NG is very uncertain. No evidence was found for cervicitis, chronic pelvic pain, or infertility in males from CT screening, or on any clinical outcomes from NG screening. Undergoing screening, or having a diagnosis of CT, may cause a small-to-moderate number of people to experience some degree of harm, mainly due to feelings of stigmatization and anxiety about future infertility risk. The number of individuals affected in the entire screening-eligible population is likely smaller. Screening may make little-to-no difference for general anxiety, self-esteem, or relationship break-up. Evidence on transmission from studies comparing home versus clinic screening is very uncertain. Four studies on patient preferences found that although utility values for the different consequences of CT and NG infections are probably quite similar, when considering the duration of the health state experiences, infertility and chronic pelvic pain are probably valued much more than PID, ectopic pregnancy, and cervicitis. How patients weigh the potential benefits versus harms of screening is very uncertain (1 survey, 10 qualitative studies); risks to reproductive health and transmission appear to be more important than the (often transient) psychosocial harms. DISCUSSION: Most of the evidence on screening for CT and/or NG offers low or very low certainty about the benefits and harms. Indirectness from use of comparison groups receiving some screening, incomplete outcome ascertainment, and use of outreach settings was a major contributor to uncertainty. Patient preferences indicate that the potential benefits from screening appear to outweigh the possible harms. Direct evidence about which screening strategies and intervals to use, which age to start and stop screening, and whether screening males in addition to females is necessary to prevent clinical outcomes is scarce, and further research in these areas would be informative. Apart from the evidence in this review, information on factors related to equity, acceptability, implementation, cost/resources, and feasibility will support recommendations made by the Task Force.

The Rwanda National Guidelines for sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndromic management are not yet informed by the local prevalence and correlates of STI etiologies, a component World Health Organization guidelines stress as critical to optimize locally relevant algorithms. METHODS: Radio announcements and pharmacists recruited symptomatic patients to seek free STI services in Kigali. Clients who sought services were asked to refer sexual partners and symptomatic friends. Demographic, behavioral risk factor, medical history, and symptom data were collected. Genital exams were performed by trained research nurses and physicians. We conducted phlebotomy for rapid HIV and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) serologies and vaginal pool swab for microscopy of wet preparation to diagnose Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV), and vaginal Candida albicans (VCA). GeneXpert testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) were conducted. Here we assess factors associated with diagnosis of NG and CT in men and women. We also explore factors associated with TV, BV and VCA in women. Finally, we describe genital ulcer and RPR results by HIV status, gender, and circumcision in men. RESULTS: Among 974 men (with 1013 visits), 20% were positive for CT and 74% were positive for NG. Among 569 women (with 579 visits), 17% were positive for CT and 27% were positive for NG. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with CT in men included younger age, responding to radio advertisements, <17 days since suspected exposure, and not having dysuria. Factors associated with NG in men included not having higher education or full-time employment, <17 days since suspected exposure, not reporting a genital ulcer, and having urethral discharge on physical exam. Factors associated with CT in women included younger age and < = 10 days with symptoms. Factors associated with NG in women included younger age, lower education and lack of full-time employment, sometimes using condoms vs. never, using hormonal vs. non-hormonal contraception, not having genital ulcer or itching, having symptoms < = 10 days, HIV+ status, having BV, endocervical discharge noted on speculum exam, and negative vaginal wet mount for VCA. In multivariate analyses, only reporting >1 partner was associated with BV; being single and RPR+ was associated with TV; and having < = 1 partner in the last month, being pregnant, genital itching, discharge, and being HIV and RPR negative were associated with VCA. Genital ulcers and positive RPR were associated with being HIV+ and lack of circumcision among men. HIV+ women were more likely to be RPR+. In HIV+ men and women, ulcers were more likely to be herpetic rather than syphilitic compared with their HIV- counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Syndromic management guidelines in Rwanda can be improved with consideration of the prevalence of confirmed infections from this study of symptomatic men and women representative of those who would seek care at government health centers. Inclusion of demographic and risk factor measures shown to be predictive of STI and non-STI dysbioses may also increase diagnostic accuracy.",1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),2021,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8547-2004', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8917-2305']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0250044 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-00310 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data can be used to identify new AMR clones and transmission networks and inform the development of point-of-care tests for antimicrobial susceptibility, novel antimicrobials and vaccines. Community-driven tools that provide an easy access to and analysis of genomic and epidemiological data is the way forward for public health surveillance. METHODS: Here we present a public health-focussed scheme for genomic epidemiology of N. gonorrhoeae at Pathogenwatch ( https://pathogen.watch/ngonorrhoeae ). An international advisory group of experts in epidemiology, public health, genetics and genomics of N. gonorrhoeae was convened to inform on the utility of current and future analytics in the platform. We implement backwards compatibility with MLST, NG-MAST and NG-STAR typing schemes as well as an exhaustive library of genetic AMR determinants linked to a genotypic prediction of resistance to eight antibiotics. A collection of over 12,000 N. gonorrhoeae genome sequences from public archives has been quality-checked, assembled and made public together with available metadata for contextualization. RESULTS: AMR prediction from genome data revealed specificity values over 99% for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone and sensitivity values around 99% for benzylpenicillin and tetracycline. A case study using the Pathogenwatch collection of N. gonorrhoeae public genomes showed the global expansion of an azithromycin-resistant lineage carrying a mosaic mtr over at least the last 10 years, emphasising the power of Pathogenwatch to explore and evaluate genomic epidemiology questions of public health concern. CONCLUSIONS: The N. gonorrhoeae scheme in Pathogenwatch provides customised bioinformatic pipelines guided by expert opinion that can be adapted to public health agencies and departments with little expertise in bioinformatics and lower-resourced settings with internet connection but limited computational infrastructure. The advisory group will assess and identify ongoing public health needs in the field of gonorrhoea, particularly regarding gonococcal AMR, in order to further enhance utility with modified or new analytic methods.",1756-994X (Electronic) 1756-994X (Linking),2021 Apr 19,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4162-0228'],"['10.1186/s13073-021-00858-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13073-021-00858-2 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Antimicrobial resistance', 'Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Neisseria gonorrhoeae', 'Pathogenwatch', 'Public health', 'Surveillance']",,,

Mismatch repair is initiated after recognition of a non-canonical nucleotide pair by the MutS protein and the formation of a complex between MutS and MutL. Eukaryotic and most bacterial MutL homologs function as endonucleases that introduce a single-strand break in the daughter strand of the DNA, thus activating the repair process. However, many aspects of the functioning of this protein remain unknown. We studied the ATPase and DNA binding functions of the MutL protein from the pathogenic bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NgoMutL), which exhibits endonuclease activity. For the first time, the kinetic parameters of ATP hydrolysis by the full-length NgoMutL protein were determined. Its interactions with single- and double-stranded DNA fragments of various lengths were studied. NgoMutL was shown to be able to efficiently form complexes with DNA fragments that are longer than 40 nucleotides. Using modified DNA duplexes harboring a 2-pyridyldisulfide group on linkers of various lengths, we obtained NgoMutL conjugates with DNA for the first time. According to these results, the Cys residues of the wild-type protein are located at a distance of approximately 18-50 A from the duplex. The efficiency of the affinity modification of Cys residues in NgoMutL with reactive DNAs was shown to decrease in the presence of ATP or its non-hydrolyzable analog, as well as ZnCl2, in the reaction mixture. We hypothesize that the conserved Cys residues of the C-terminal domain of NgoMutL, which are responsible for the coordination of metal ions in the active center of the protein, are involved in its interaction with DNA.

Anti-glycan antibodies can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. For example, alloantibodies to ABO blood group carbohydrates can help reduce the spread of some infectious diseases, but they also impose limitations for blood transfusions. Antibodies that recognize self-glycans can contribute to autoimmune diseases, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. In addition to endogenous antibodies that arise through natural processes, a variety of vaccines induce anti-glycan antibodies as a primary mechanism of protection. Some examples of approved carbohydrate-based vaccines that have had a major impact on human health are against pneumococcus, Haemophilus influeanza type b, and Neisseria meningitidis.

Considering the potential waning of the antibody response reported in the literature, the different vaccination schemes that were used in our country over the past decade, and that Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C continues to circulate, the Portuguese population may currently be at increased risk of infection. In the absence of national data, we evaluated the seroprotection level of the Portuguese population against MenC, in order to identify the protected fraction of the population and ponder on the necessity of a booster dose of the MCC vaccine. METHODS: We measured serum bactericidal antibody levels against MenC in a representative sample of the population (n = 1500) aged 2-64 years who participated in the 2015/2016 National Serological Survey. RESULTS: A total of 31.1% (466/1500, 95%CI: 29-33%) of the individuals studied were protected against MenC. The geometric mean titre was 6.5. The proportion of seroprotected was particularly low in children aged 2-4 years (<16%) who received a single dose of the vaccine at 12 months of age (vaccination strategy since 2012). The proportion of seroprotected was higher (44.7% to 53.5%) in adolescent and young adults (15-24 years of age), resulting from vaccination during the catch-up campaign at 5-15 years of age. The highest protection rates were observed when the vaccine was administered during adolescence. CONCLUSION: The small fraction of population seroprotected, combined with the already known waning effect of the antibody response over time, may indicate that the Portuguese population will become progressively more exposed to the risk of infection.

N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is the most common NulO. It covers the membrane surface of all human cells and is a central molecule in the process of self-recognition via SIGLECS receptors. Some pathogenic bacteria escape the immune system by copying the sialylation of the host cell membrane. Neu5Ac production in these bacteria is catalysed by the enzyme NeuB. Some bacteria can also produce other NulOs named pseudaminic and legionaminic acids, through the NeuB homologues PseI and LegI, respectively. In Opisthokonta eukaryotes, the biosynthesis of Neu5Ac is catalysed by the enzyme NanS. In this study, we used publicly available data of sequences of NulOs synthases to investigate its distribution within the three domains of life and its relationship with pathogenic bacteria. We mined the KEGG database and found 425 NeuB sequences. Most NeuB sequences (58.74 %) from the KEGG orthology database were classified as from environmental bacteria; however, sequences from pathogenic bacteria showed higher conservation and prevalence of a specific domain named SAF. Using the HMM profile we identified 13 941 NulO synthase sequences in UniProt. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences showed that the synthases were divided into three main groups that can be related to the lifestyle of these bacteria: (I) predominantly environmental, (II) intermediate and (III) predominantly pathogenic. NeuB was widely distributed in the groups. However, LegI and PseI were more concentrated in groups II and III, respectively. We also found that PseI appeared later in the evolutionary process, derived from NeuB. We use this same methodology to retrieve sialic acid synthase sequences from Archaea and Eukarya. A large-scale phylogenetic analysis showed that while the Archaea sequences are spread across the tree, the eukaryotic NanS sequences were grouped in a specific branch in group II. None of the bacterial NanS sequences grouped with the eukaryotic branch. The analysis of conserved residues showed that the synthases of Archaea and Eukarya present a mutation in one of the three catalytic residues, an E134D change, related to a Neisseria meningitidis reference sequence. We also found that the conservation profile is higher between NeuB of pathogenic bacteria and NanS of eukaryotes than between NeuB of environmental bacteria and NanS of eukaryotes. Our large-scale analysis brings new perspectives on the evolution of NulOs synthases, suggesting their presence in the last common universal ancestor.",2057-5858 (Electronic) 2057-5858 (Linking),2021 Apr,,['10.1099/mgen.0.000563 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Bacteria', 'NeuB/NanS', 'evolution', 'nonulosonic acid synthase', 'pathogenicity']",,,

In particular, it is considered to remove tumors involving the splenic hilum or the capsule of the spleen to secure tumor-free margins sufficiently. For splenectomy, the gastro-splenic ligament is opened, and the short gastric vessels are dissected. After the splenocolic ligament and splenic flexure of the colon are transected, the peritoneal attachments, including the splenorenal and splenophrenic ligaments, are divided to mobilize the spleen, and then the splenic artery and vein are identified and ligated separately. If DP is needed for en bloc resection of tumors, a linear cutting stapler is used to remove the tail of the pancreas, and suture reinforcement with 2-0 or 3-0 prolene on the cut section of the pancreas is performed to prevent postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). Immunization with a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine is required after splenectomy to avoid overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. If POPF occurs after splenectomy or DP, continued drainage with close monitoring is needed with the administration of board spectrum antibiotics in grade A or B POPF according to the criteria of the International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF). In contrast, grade C POPF requires aggressive management using nothing by mouth, total parenteral nutrition, and somatostatin analogs, and sometimes reoperation if deteriorating signs such as sepsis and organ dysfunction. Thus, the effort for preserving pancreatic tail is needed to reduce hospitalization and the risk of POPF despite the minimal impact of DP on the success rate of optimal cytoreduction.",2227-684X (Print) 2227-684X (Linking),2021 Mar,,"['10.21037/gs-2019-ursoc-09 [doi]', 'gs-10-03-1218 [pii]']",['eng'],China (Republic : 1949- ),"['Ovarian cancer', 'distal pancreatectomy (DP)', 'splenectomy']",['2021 Gland Surgery.

We describe two siblings with a heterozygous NM_001928.3(CFD):c.125C>A p.(Ser42*) mutation in the complement factor D (fD) gene having a history of recurrent bacterial infections. We determined the effect of heterozygous fD deficiency on AP complement activity. Methods: We determined the effect of fD levels on complement activation as measured by AP activity, complement C3 binding to the bacterial surface of Neisseria meningitidis (Nm), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), and complement-mediated killing of Nm and NTHi. In addition, we measured the effect of vaccination of complement C3 binding to the bacterial surface and killing of Nm. Results: Reconstitution of fD-deficient serum with fD increased AP activity in a dose- and time-dependent way. Reconstitution of patient serum with fD to normal levels increased complement C3 binding to Sp, Nm and NTHi, as well as complement-mediated killing of Nm and NTHi. Vaccination increased complement C3 binding and resulted in complete killing of Nm without fD reconstitution. Conclusion: We conclude that low fD serum levels (< 0.5 mug mL(-1)) lead to a reduced speed of complement activation, which results in diminished bacterial killing, consistent with recurrent bacterial infections observed in our index patients. Specific antibodies induced by vaccination are able to overcome the diminished bacterial killing capacity in patients with low fD levels.",2050-0068 (Print) 2050-0068 (Linking),2021,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5317-3202'],"['10.1002/cti2.1256 [doi]', 'CTI21256 [pii]']",['eng'],Australia,"['complement', 'factor D', 'haplodeficiency', 'immunodeficiency', 'infection', 'vaccination']","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

This review details clinical, epidemiological, animal and entomological investigations conducted for AES due to O. tsutsugamushi during 2015 and 2017 in Gorakhpur region. Surveillance of acute febrile illness among children attending peripheral health facilities identified scrub typhus as an important aetiology of febrile illness during monsoon and post-monsoon months.

Children acquired this infection through recent exposure to outdoor environment, while playing, or visiting fields or defecating in open fields. A few of the children with scrub typhus progress to develop CNS manifestations. Hence, early administration of appropriate antibiotics is crucial in preventing progression of AFI due to scrub typhus to AES.

If antibiotic therapy is delayed, often due to mis- or late diagnosis, the case fatality rate can increase considerably. Scrub typhus is caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium, Orientia tsutsugamushi, which invades phagocytes and endothelial cells in vivo and diverse tissue culture cell types in vitro. The ability of O. tsutsugamushi to replicate in the cytoplasm indicates that it has evolved to counter eukaryotic host cell immune defense mechanisms. The transcription factor, NF-kappaB, is a tightly regulated initiator of proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses. Typically, the inhibitory proteins p105 and IkappaBalpha sequester the NF-kappaB p50:p65 heterodimer in the cytoplasm. Canonical activation of NF-kappaB via TNFalpha involves IKKbeta-mediated serine phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and p105, which leads to their degradation and enables NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. A portion of p105 is also processed into p50. O. tsutsugamushi impairs NF-kappaB translocation into the nucleus, but how it does so is incompletely defined. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Western blot, densitometry, and quantitative RT-PCR analyses of O. tsutsugamushi infected host cells were used to determine if the pathogen's ability to inhibit NF-kappaB is linked to modulation of p105. Results demonstrate that p105 levels are elevated several-fold in O. tsutsugamushi infected HeLa and RF/6A cells with only a nominal increase in p50. The O. tsutsugamushi-stimulated increase in p105 is bacterial dose- and protein synthesis-dependent, but does not occur at the level of host cell transcription. While TNFalpha-induced phosphorylation of p105 serine 932 proceeds unhindered in infected cells, p105 levels remain elevated and NF-kappaB p65 is retained in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: O. tsutsugamushi specifically stabilizes p105 to inhibit the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, which advances understanding of how it counters host immunity to establish infection.",1935-2735 (Electronic) 1935-2727 (Linking),2021 Apr,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3462-8985', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0783-2948', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2778-5066']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0009339 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-20-01099 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

This study aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of scrub typhus and identify associated risk and protective factors among forestry workers, a neglected risk group for scrub typhus, in National Park Offices in South Korea. A nationwide cross-sectional serosurvey was carried out on 1945 National Park Office forestry workers (NPOFWs) in South Korea during December 2016. We visited 29 main offices and used a structured questionnaire to collect data regarding general characteristics, work activities, work hygiene-related factors, and other potential risk factors.

Both diseases have similar clinical manifestations in certain disease stages and similar epidemic seasons, which has caused difficulties for physicians in distinguishing them. The aim of this study was to investigate whether misdiagnosis of scrub typhus as HFRS occurred in patients in Shandong Province. METHODS: Serum samples (N = 112) of clinically suspected HFRS patients from 2013 to 2014 in Shandong Province were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to both hantavirus and Orientia tsutsugamushi. RESULTS: ELISA showed that 56.3% (63/112) and 8.0% (9/112) of clinically suspected HFRS patients were IgM antibody positive to hantavirus and O. tsutsugamushi, respectively. Among the hantavirus IgM antibody positive patients, 7.9% (5/63) were also IgM antibody positive to O. tsutsugamushi.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical records of dogs diagnosed with a melting corneal ulcer presented to a referral hospital in Hertfordshire, UK between 2014 and 2018. RESULTS: One hundred and ten melting corneal ulcers were sampled in 106 dogs. The most common pure bacterial isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 26) followed by beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (n = 12). Melting corneal ulcers that cultured coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, coliform bacteria, Pasteurella multocida, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus viridans presented in smaller numbers and were analyzed together (n = 16). Multiple cultures were identified in nine cases (n = 9). Forty-seven cultures yielded no bacterial growth (n = 47). The susceptibility to fluoroquinolones remained high with the exception of beta-hemolytic Streptococci. There was no significant difference in the ulcer severity at presentation in regard to the cultured bacteria. Overall, 63 eyes (57%) received surgical grafting in addition to medical treatment. In 14 cases (13%), the progression of corneal melting despite medical +/- surgical treatment resulted in enucleation. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of the enucleated eyes cultured pure Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. In contrast, all beta-hemolytic Streptococcus-associated ulcers healed. CONCLUSIONS: The most common bacterial species associated with canine keratomalacia were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Because of the variation in antibacterial sensitivity between these two species, bacterial culture and sensitivity testing should be performed in all dogs presenting with keratomalacia. Melting corneal ulcers associated with pure Pseudomonas infection were significantly more likely to result in globe loss than melting corneal ulcers associated with other cultures.",1463-5224 (Electronic) 1463-5216 (Linking),2021 Apr 1,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2773-5301'],['10.1111/vop.12885 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Pseudomonas', 'collagenolysis', 'dogs', 'keratomalacia', 'melting ulcer', 'retrospective study']",['(c) 2021 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.'],,

Pasteurella multocida is responsible for different disease syndromes in a wide range of domesticated animal species. However, very little is known about the influence of bacteriophages on disease pathogenesis in this species. RESULTS: Temperate bacteriophage diversity was assessed in 47 P. multocida isolates of avian (9), bovine (8), ovine (10) and porcine (20) origin. Induction of phage particles with mitomycin C identified a diverse range of morphological types representing both Siphoviridae and Myoviridae family-types in 29 isolates. Phage of both morphological types were identified in three isolates indicating that a single bacterial host may harbour multiple prophages. DNA was isolated from bacteriophages recovered from 18 P. multocida isolates and its characterization by restriction endonuclease (RE) analysis identified 10 different RE types. Phage of identical RE types were identified in certain closely-related strains but phage having different RE types were present in other closely-related isolates suggesting possible recent acquisition. The host range of the induced phage particles was explored using plaque assay but only 11 (38%) phage lysates produced signs of infection in a panel of indicator strains comprising all 47 isolates. Notably, the majority (9/11) of phage lysates which caused infection originated from two groups of phylogenetically unrelated ovine and porcine strains that uniquely possessed the toxA gene.

Cattle were proposed as the natural reservoir of IDV in which infection was associated with mild-to-moderate respiratory clinical signs (i.e. cough, nasal discharge and dyspnoea). METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to investigate the role of IDV in bovine respiratory disease, during the period 2017-2020, 883 nasal or naso-pharyngeal swabs from Canadian cattle with respiratory signs (cough and/or dyspnoea) were tested by (RT-)qPCR for IDV and other major bovine viral (bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3 and bovine coronavirus) and bacterial (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis) respiratory pathogens. In addition, whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were carried out on five IDV-positive samples. The prevalence of IDV RT-qPCR (with cut-off: Cq < 38) at animal level was estimated at 5.32% (95% confidence interval: 3.94-7.02). Positive result of IDV was significantly associated with (RT-)qPCR-positive results for bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Mycoplasma bovis. While phylogenetic analyses indicate that most segments belonged to clade D/660, reassortment between clades D/660 and D/OK were evidenced in four samples collected in 2018-2020.

This study sought to establish if some micro-organisms can be found in high numbers in lungs with pleurisy by assessing batches of pigs at an abattoir in Queensland Australia. DESIGN: Samples of lung (including trachea/bronchus and lymph nodes) from a maximum of 5 pleurisy affected pigs were collected from 46 batches of pigs representing 46 Queensland farms. PROCEDURE: Pleurisy-affected lung areas were cultured by traditional bacteriological methods and bacteria quantified by plate scores. Additionally, tracheal or bronchial swabs and apical lobe fluid were tested for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae DNA and the superior tracheobronchial lymph nodes were tested for porcine circovirus type 2 DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All apparently significant bacteria were identified via PCR or sequencing. Typing was undertaken on some of the bacterial isolates. RESULTS: The most prevalent pathogens were M. hyopneumoniae, Streptococcus suis and Porcine Circovirus type 2, being found in 34, 38 and 31 batches, respectively.

Microbiota changes in reaction to viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), have been investigated almost exclusively in the female reproductive tract. However, HPV infection may also affect male health by reducing semen quality and fertility. The aim of this study was to investigate whether present HPV DNA is associated with detectable changes in semen bacterial microbiota composition and diversity. METHODS: This study relied on stored semen samples from 31 fertile healthy men who participated in the Finnish family HPV Study during the years 1998-2001. DNA was extracted from semen with PCR template preparation kit. HPV was genotyped using Luminex-based Multimetrix(R) assay. Microbiota was analyzed from the V3-V4 region of 16S rDNA gene following sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform. All statistical analyses were performed with Calypso software version 8.84. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 19.4% (6/31) of the semen samples. HPV status in the semen did not impact the alpha-diversity estimations, as measured by Chao1 and Shannon indices, nor ss-diversity. Nevertheless, HPV-positive semen samples exhibited differences in the taxonomic composition of the bacterial microbiota including higher abundances of Moraxellaceae (p = 0.028), Streptococcus (p = 0.0058) and Peptostreptococcus (p = 0.012) compared to HPV-negative semen samples. CONCLUSION: HPV infection is associated with altered bacterial microbiota composition in semen, and this might have in impact to male health in general.

This infection can present as either type 1 infection caused by a mixed microflora (Streptococci, Enterobacteriacae, Bacteroides sp., and Peptostreptococcus sp.), most commonly developing in patients after surgery or in diabetic patients, or as type 2. The latter type is monomicrobial and, usually, caused by group A Streptococci. Rarely, this type can be also caused by other pathogens, such as Vibrio vulnificus. V vulnificus is a small mobile Gram-negative rod capable of causing 3 types of infections in humans-gastroenteritis, primary infection of the vascular bed, and wound infections. If infecting a wound, V vulnificus can cause a life-threatening condition-necrotizing fasciitis. We present a rare case of necrotizing fasciitis developing after an insect bite followed by exposure to the seawater. Rapid propagation of the infectious complication in the region of the right lower limb led to a serious consideration of the necessity of amputation. Due to the clearly demarcated necroses and secondary skin and soft tissue infection caused by a multiresistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii, we, however, resorted to the use of selective chemical necrectomy using 40% benzoic acid-a unique application in this kind of condition. The chemical necrectomy was successful, relatively gentle and thanks to its selectivity, vital parts of the limb remained preserved and could have been subsequently salvaged at minimum blood loss. Moreover, the antimicrobial effect of benzoic acid led to rapid decolonization of the necrosis and wound bed preparation, which allowed us to perform defect closure using split-thickness skin grafts.

The human gut microbiome has become an active area of research for understanding the initiation, progression, and treatment of colorectal cancer. Despite multiple studies having found significant alterations in the carriage of specific bacteria within the gut microbiome of colorectal cancer patients, no single bacterium has been unequivocally connected to all cases. Whether alterations in species carriages are the cause or outcome of cancer formation is still unclear, but what is clear is that focus should be placed on understanding changes to the bacterial community structure within the cancer-associated gut microbiome. RESULTS: By applying a novel set of analyses on 252 previously published whole-genome shotgun sequenced fecal samples from healthy and late-stage colorectal cancer subjects, we identify taxonomic, functional, and structural changes within the cancer-associated human gut microbiome. Bacterial association networks constructed from these data exhibited widespread differences in the underlying bacterial community structure between healthy and colorectal cancer associated gut microbiomes. Within the cancer-associated ecosystem, bacterial species were found to form associations with other species that are taxonomically and functionally dissimilar to themselves, as well as form modules functionally geared towards potential changes in the tumor-associated ecosystem. Bacterial community profiling of these samples revealed a significant increase in species diversity within the cancer-associated gut microbiome, and an elevated relative abundance of species classified as originating from the oral microbiome including, but not limited to, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Gemella morbillorum, and Parvimonas micra. Differential abundance analyses of community functional capabilities revealed an elevation in functions linked to virulence factors and peptide degradation, and a reduction in functions involved in amino-acid biosynthesis within the colorectal cancer gut microbiome. CONCLUSIONS: We utilize whole-genome shotgun sequenced fecal samples provided from a large cohort of late-stage colorectal cancer and healthy subjects to identify a number of potentially important taxonomic, functional, and structural alterations occurring within the colorectal cancer associated gut microbiome. Our analyses indicate that the cancer-associated ecosystem influences bacterial partner selection in the native microbiota, and we highlight specific oral bacteria and their associations as potentially relevant towards aiding tumor progression.",1471-2180 (Electronic) 1471-2180 (Linking),2021 Mar 31,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5581-5002'],"['10.1186/s12866-021-02153-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12866-021-02153-x [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Associations', 'Cancer', 'Colorectal', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiome', 'Networks', 'Oral', 'Pathogens']",,,

A random forest model was constructed to classify gastric histological types based on the salivary microbiota compositions. A distinct salivary microbiota was observed in patients with GC when comparing with SG and AG, which was featured by an enrichment of putative proinflammatory taxa including Corynebacterium and Streptococcus. Among the significantly decreased oral bacteria in GC patients including Haemophilus, Neisseria, Parvimonas, Peptostreptococcus, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella, Haemophilus, and Neisseria are known to reduce nitrite, which may consequently result in an accumulation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds. We found that GC can be distinguished accurately from patients with AG and SG (AUC = 0.91) by the random forest model based on the salivary microbiota profiles, and taxa belonging to unclassified Streptophyta and Streptococcus have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for GC. Remarkable changes in the salivary microbiota functions were also detected across three histological types, and the upregulation in the isoleucine and valine is in line with a higher level of these amino acids in the gastric tumor tissues that reported by other independent studies. Conclusively, bacteria in the oral cavity may contribute gastric cancer and become new diagnostic biomarkers for GC, but further evaluation against independent clinical cohorts is required.

Bacteriophages may provide a precise means for targeting oncobacteria whose relative abundance is increased in tumour tissue microbiomes. Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Parvimonas, and Treponema species are prevalent in tumour tissue microbiomes of some cancers. They may promote cancer growth by dampening immunity, stimulating release of proinflammatory cytokines, and directly interacting with cancer cells to stimulate proliferation. Lytic bacteriophages against some of these oncobacteria have been isolated and characterised. The search continues for others. The possibility exists for their testing as adjuncts to complement existing therapies. In this review, we highlight the role of oncobacteria, specifically those whose relative abundance in the intra-tumour microbiome is increased, and discuss the potential for bacteriophages against these micro-organisms to augment existing cancer therapies.

BACKGROUND: Propolis has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effect that may improve peri-implant health. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind study was performed on patients with at least one implant with PM. Participants received a professional prophylaxis and were instructed to use either test or a control gel as toothpaste three times/day for 1 month. Clinical and microbiological parameters were evaluated. PM resolution was considered in absence of bleeding on probing (BOP). Data were analysed with Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank and chi-square tests. RESULTS: Forty-six patients participated (23 in each group). After treatment, 26.1% of test patients showed complete PM resolution versus 0% in control group (p = .02). Significant reductions were observed in plaque index (p = .03), BOP (p = .04) and probing depths (p = .027) in test compared with control group.

This study aims to investigate the temporal and spatial expression of Periostin and Wnt5a/CaMKII in periodontitis and how the Wnt5a regulates Periostin through CaMKII signaling pathway in PDLCs in inflammatory environment. The experimental periodontitis mice were adopted to clarify the temporal and spatial expression of Wnt5a, CaMKII and Periostin during early periodontitis. And the Wnt5a, CaMKII and Periostin expression pattern and regulation mechanism in PDLCs were clarified in Porphyromonas gingivalis Lipopolysaccharide (P.g. LPS) induced inflammatory condition. Along with the periodontitis development, Wnt5a, CaMKII and Periostin significantly increased in periodontal ligament and partially increased in gingiva during 0 to 6 day (P < 0.05). They were involved in early periodontitis homeostasis especially in periodontal ligament tissue. Meanwhile, Wnt5a, CaMKII and Periostin were significantly decreased at 12 h (P < 0.05) and increased at 48 h (P < 0.05) in PDLCs after induced by P.g. LPS.

Visfatin is an adipokine-enzyme that can be locally produced by human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) and human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs). It can upregulate proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in various types of cells. However, the effects of visfatin on healthy and inflammatory human periodontal cells as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study firstly demonstrated visfatin expression was highly elevated in inflamed human gingiva and Pg LPS-treated hPDLCs. Moreover, recombinant visfatin significantly upregulated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) and prodegradative factors (EMPPRIN, MMP1, MMP3 and MMP13) in hPDLCs. Next, we found the levels of proinflammatory and prodegradative cytokines were significantly increased in visfatin-overexpressing hPDLCs, and decreased in visfatin-silencing inflammatory hGFs (iGFs) when treated with Pg LPS. In the absence of Pg LPS, visfatin silencing failed to affect the expression of these factors in iGFs, and overexpression of visfatin upregulated MMPs but no other factors in hPDLCs. Furthermore, marked NF-kappaB pathway activation with increased phosphorylation of p65 was observed in visfatin-overexpressing hPDLCs. BAY11-7082, a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB, partially reversed the upregulation proinflammatory and prodegradative factors induced by visfatin overexpression. Taken together, this study showed that visfatin critically regulates Pg LPS-induced proinflammatory/prodegradative effects in healthy and inflammatory periodontal cells partially via NF-kappaB pathway. The findings suggest that visfatin is closely involved in the development of periodontitis, and may serve as a promising novel biomarker and therapeutic target for periodontitis management.",1879-2596 (Electronic) 0167-4889 (Linking),2021 Apr 23,,"['S0167-4889(21)00096-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2021.119042 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Inflammation', 'Matrix metalloproteinases', 'Periodontitis', 'Porphyromonas gingivalis', 'Signaling networks', 'Visfatin']",['Copyright (c) 2021.

The LAMP method showed high specificity as DNA from the P. gingivalis HW24D1 strain could only be amplified by the type II-specific primers and that from the W83 strain could only be amplified by the type IV-specific primers. Pathogens, namely, Streptococcus sobrinus, S. mutans, and Candida species, lack the type II and IV genes, and hence, were not detected by the LAMP reaction. Both bacterial cells and purified DNA could be used in the LAMP reaction. The LAMP reaction was highly sensitive and both type II and type IV genes could be detected in 1000 DNA molecules. In the bacterial suspensions of HW24D1 and W83 strains, type II and type IV genes, respectively, could be detected in 100 bacterial cells. We examined the type II and type IV genes in the dental plaques from 22 P. gingivalis-positive patients using the LAMP method. Only one person was found to be positive for the type II gene (4.5%). For the type IV gene, 3 positive cases (13.6%) were identified.

Phytic acid has strong chelating ability with multivalent cations, which has been used in surface modification. Moreover, phytic acid was proved antibacterial potential. Herein, to improve the osteogenic and antibacterial properties, a phytic acid-magnesium (PA-Mg) layer was introduced on titanium using phytic acid as a cross-linker molecule. No obvious changes of the surface characterization were observed by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the PA-Mg layer covalently bond to the Ti surface, and the thickness of the PA-Mg layer was about 150 nm. Besides, improved hydrophilic and more protein adsorption were observed on Ti-PA-Mg. Notably, a relatively controlled magnesium release was also observed on Ti-PA-Mg. Human bone mesenchymal stem cells showed better adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation on Ti-PA-Mg samples, indicating improved biocompatibility and osteoinductivity.

Implant-associated infections are majorly attributed to biofilm formation. In this study, co-incorporated zinc- (Zn-) and strontium- (Sr-) nanorod coating on sandblasted and acid-etched (SLA) titanium (SLA-Zn/Sr) was fabricated by hydrothermal synthesis. It was aimed at promoting osteogenesis while inhibiting biofilm formation. The nanorod-like particles (phi 30-50 nm) were found to be evenly formed on SLA-Zn/Sr (Zn: 1.49 +/- 0.16 wt%; Sr: 21.69 +/- 2.74 wt%) that was composed of well-crystallized ZnTiO3 and SrTiO3 phases. With a sufficient interface bonding strength (42.00 +/- 3.00 MPa), SLA-Zn/Sr enhanced the corrosion resistance property of titanium. Besides, SLA-Zn/Sr promoted the cellular initial adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs in vitro while inhibiting the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus and Porphyromonas gingivalis . In addition, through down-regulating icaA gene expression, this novel surface reduced the secretion of polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (reduced by 87.9% compared to SLActive) to suppress the S. aureus biofilm formation. We, therefore, propose a new chemical modification on titanium for multifunctional implant material development. Due to the Zn/Sr co-doping in coating, material properties, early osteogenic effect and antibacterial ability of titanium can be simultaneously enhanced, which has the potential to be applied in dental implantation in the future.",1552-4981 (Electronic) 1552-4973 (Linking),2021 Apr 19,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3190-059X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1761-1890', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0302-4492']",['10.1002/jbm.b.34834 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['antimicrobial effect', 'hydrothermal synthesis', 'osteogenesis', 'strontium', 'zinc']",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],,

Furthermore, the susceptibility pattern of isolated bacteria to antimicrobial drugs and the efficiency of disinfectants (CID 20, Durak((R)) plus, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nano zinc oxide (ZnO NPs), and hydrogen peroxide loaded nano zinc oxide (H2O2/ZnO NPs) composites against isolated bacteria were evaluated. Materials and Methods: A total of 271 samples were collected from duck pens, including 35 fecal droppings, 200 environmental samples, and 36 from the hands of pen workers for isolation and identification of bacterial strains using standard microbiological procedures. After that, the antibiotic sensitivity testing of 40 bacterial isolates was carried out using disk diffusion assay. ZnO NPs and H2O2/ZnO NPs were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectrum and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The efficacy of disinfectants and nanocomposites was evaluated against enteropathogenic bacteria using the broth macro-dilution method. Results: The results showed that the overall prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in duck pens was 62.73. The highest isolation rate was detected in duck fecal droppings (100%), while Escherichia coli was found to be the most isolated pathogen (56.47%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.8%), Proteus mirabilis (15.29), and Salmonella species (6.47%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was detected in the majority of bacterial isolates.

On the basis of the 16S Sanger sequencing of bacterial clones from agar plates, we identified 18 bacterial species in the oropharynx of N. atra, including Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis, which were also present in the infected bite wound. Using NGS of 16S metagenomics, we uncovered more than 286 bacterial species in the oropharynx of N. atra. In addition, the bacterial species identified using 16S Sanger sequencing accounted for only 2% of those identified through NGS of 16S metagenomics. The bacterial microbiota of the oropharynx of N. atra were modeled better using NGS of 16S metagenomics compared to microbial culture-based techniques. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Proteus penneri were also identified in the NGS of 16S metagenomics. Understanding the bacterial microbiota that are native to the oropharynx of N. atra, in addition to the bite wound, may have additional therapeutic implications regarding empiric antibiotic selection for managing N. atra bites.",1935-2735 (Electronic) 1935-2727 (Linking),2021 Apr,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4846-1837', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3308-6042', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0365-9970', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8006-4917']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0009331 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-20-02011 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

Technologies for effective litter odor control have not been rigorously evaluated. Here, we report on the effectiveness of a novel litter formulation of 1-monochlorodimethylhydantoin (MCDMH)-modified clinoptilolite zeolite (MCDMH-Z) to control the odors of 3-mercapto-3-methylbutanol (3M3MB) and ammonia, the principal products generated by the enzymatic breakdown of felinine and urea, respectively. METHODS: The efficacy of MCDMH-Z for the odor control of 3M3MB was determined by solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, colorimetric analysis and a sensory panel. Enzyme inhibition was monitored by a colorimetric coupled assay for ammonia. The antimicrobial properties were measured by a reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs). RESULTS: 3M3MB proved highly susceptible to modification by MCDMH-Z granules. Headspace above litter exposed to MCDMH-Z showed no detectable 3M3MB; levels >59 ng were detected in commercially available products. Urease activity decreased by >97% after incubation with MCDMH-Z to 0.14 mg/ml. Cat litter F showed comparable inhibition (0.13 mg/ml); others showed less inhibition, producing up to 4.8 mg/ml of ammonia. MCDMH-Z reduced the CFUs of Proteus vulgaris by six log reduction values in 30 mins; in the same amount of time, no reduction was seen with commercial products tested. The odor control capability of the MCDMH-Z granules was further supported by a sensory panel scoring 3M3MB-spiked litters. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Samples of commercially available litter products showed an effect on malodor, or inhibition of urease, or contained antimicrobial activity; no samples were capable of accomplishing these concurrently. In contrast, MCDMH-Z granules were effective in all three test categories. Control of felinine-derived odors, in particular, has the potential to improve cat owner satisfaction, and may beneficially affect cat behaviors provoked by pheromonally active sulfurous metabolites deposited in the litter.",1532-2750 (Electronic) 1098-612X (Linking),2021 Apr 28,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4259-6642'],['10.1177/1098612X211009136 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['3-mercapto-3-methylbutanol', 'Felinine', 'N-halamine', 'litter', 'malodor', 'odor control']",,,

The use of appropriate antibiotics has significant therapeutic effects, but has led to the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains. In this study, a P. vulgaris strain, designated ""P3M,"" was isolated from Penaeus vannamei in Tianjin, China. The whole genome of P3M was sequenced, generating detailed information, including the key genes involved in important metabolic pathways and their physiological functions. A total of 218 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were predicted in the genome. The determination of various minimum inhibitory concentrations indicated that P3M is a multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterium, with significant resistance to 16 antibiotics in seven categories. Determination of fractional inhibitory concentration index showed that the combination of ciprofloxacin plus tetracycline exhibited synergistic antimicrobial activity. Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses detected the presence of two two-component systems that mediate multidrug resistance and several mobile genetic elements involved in the horizontal transfer of ARGs in P3M. P. vulgaris strains represent a serious challenge to clinicians and infection control teams for its ubiquity worldwide and close relevance with human life.

This study is, focused on the synthesis of magnesium oxide (MgO) and chitosan-modified magnesium oxide (CMgO) nanoparticles (NPs), via a green precipitation process. In this process, leaves extract of Plumbago zeylanica L was, used as a nucleating agent. The MgO and CMgO NPs exhibit face-centered cubic structures, as confirmed by XRD studies. Morphologically, the FESEM and TEM images showed that the MgO and CMgO NPs were spherical, with an average particle size of ~40+/-2 and ~37+/-2 nm, respectively. EDX spectra were used to identify the elemental compositions of the nanoparticles. By using FTIR spectra, the Mg-O stretching frequency of MgO and CMgO NPs were observed at 431 and 435 cm(-1), respectively. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of MgO and CMgO NPs, revealed oxygen vacancies at 499 nm and 519 nm, respectively, due to the active radicals generated, which were responsible for their biocidal activities. The toxicity effects of the nanoparticles developed, on cell viability (antibacterial and anticancer), were measured on the MCF-7 cell line and six different types of gram-negative bacteria. The antibacterial activities of the nanoparticles on: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris and Vibrio cholerae bacteria, were studied with the well diffusion method. The MgO and CMgO NPs were tested on breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) via an MTT assay and it proved that CMgO NPs possess higher anticancer properties than MgO NPs. Overall, CMgO NPs showed a higher amount of cytotoxicity for both the bacterial and cancer cells when compared to the MgO NPs. Toxicity studies of fibroblast L929 cells revealed that the CMgO NPs were less harmful to the healthy cells when compared to the MgO NPs.

So, the present study was conducted to detect species of Proteus by PCR and RFLP along with their antibiotic resistance pattern. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology of Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from July 2018 to June 2019. A total of 500 wound swab and pus, urine and blood samples were tested for bacterial pathogens. Proteus spp. were identified and differentiated by biochemical test, PCR and RFLP. Antibiotic susceptibility was performed by disc-diffusion technique. Fourty Proteus spp. was isolated from 300 culture positive samples, giving 13.33% prevalence of Proteus infections. Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were identified by culture, biochemical test, PCR and RFLP. The results were similar by both methods (biochemical tests and PCR). RFLP of 16S rRNA fragments digested with HaeIII revealed that P. mirabilis consisted of two bands at approximately 110 and 190 bp and P. vulgaris consisted of three bands at approximately 100, 180 and 220 bp. The proportion (80%) of P. mirabilis was more than P. vulgaris. Highest proportion (77.5%) of Proteus spp. was isolated from wound swab and pus followed by urine samples. A significant proportion of Proteus spp. was multidrug resistant (90%) and extensively drug resistant (37.5%). Fosfomycin was found the most sensitive drug followed by imipenem.

They offer an alternative to commercially available testing systems which were considered to have disadvantages in terms of cost- and time-efficiency. The aim of this study was to develop an LC-MS/MS-based antibiotic hydrolysis assay for evaluating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of Gram-negative bacteria. Materials and Methods: Four species of Gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii and Acinetobacter baumannii) were tested against six antibiotics from three different classes: ampicillin, meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. Bacterial suspensions from each species were incubated with a mixture of the six antibiotics. Any remaining antibiotic following incubation was measured using LC-MS/MS. The results were interpreted using measurements obtained for an E. coli strain sensitive to all antibiotics and expressed as percentage of hydrolyzed antibiotic. These were subsequently compared to commercially-available system for the bacteria identification and susceptibility testing. Results: Overall, LC-MS/MS assay and commercial antimicrobial susceptibility platform results showed good agreement in terms of an organism being resistant/sensitive to an antibiotic. The time required to complete the LC-MS/MS-based hydrolysis test was under 5 h, significantly shorter that commercially available susceptibility testing platforms. Conclusion: By using a sensitive strain for results interpretation and simultaneous use of multiple antibiotics, the proposed protocol offers improved robustness and multiplexing over previously described methods for antibiotic sensitivity testing.

Species of the genus Providencia exhibited different functional constraints, with the core genes, accessory genes, and unique genes. A maximum-likelihood phylogeny reconstructed with concatenated single-copy core genes classified all Providencia isolates into 11 distant groups. Comprehensive and systematic comparative genomic analyses revealed that specific distributions of virulence genes, which were highly homologous to virulence genes of the genus Proteus, contributed to diversity in pathogenicity of Providencia alcalifaciens, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. Furthermore, multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotypes of isolates of Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were predominantly due to resistance genes from class 1 and 2 integrons. In addition, Providencia rettgeri and Providencia stuartii harbored more genes related to material transport and energy metabolism, which conferred a stronger ability to adapt to diverse environments.

METHODS: The antibacterial activity of the tested samples (extract, the fractions and their compounds isolated by CC and the structures obtained by exploiting (1)H and (13)C Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra) in the presence and absence of an efflux pumps inhibitor, phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN), was evaluated using the micro-dilution method. The effects of the most active sample were evaluated on the cell growth kinetic and on the bacterial H(+)-ATPase proton pumps. RESULTS: Phytochemical composition of the crude extract showed a rather selective distribution of secondary metabolites (presence of polyphenols, tannins, steroids, triterpenes, flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins and absence of anthocyanins, anthraquinones). The tested samples displayed different antibacterial activities with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 64 to 512 mug/mL. Crude extract (CS) and fraction CSc showed the highest inhibitory spectra, both inhibiting all of the studied bacteria except Enterobacter aerogenes EA27 strain. Fraction CSc exerted bactericidal effects on most bacteria meanwhile, crude extract (CS) and sub-fraction CSc2 exerted bacteriostatic effects. Compounds 1 (spectaline) and 2 (iso-6-cassine) inhibited the growth of 70% (Escherichia coli ATCC8739 and AG102, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC11296, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC13048 and EA27, Providencia stuartii ATCC29916, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01) and 60% (Escherichia coli ATCC8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC11296 and KP55, Providencia stuartii ATCC29916, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 and PA124) of bacteria respectively with MICs ranging from 128 to 512 mug/mL. In the presence of PAbetaN, the activities of crude extract CS, fraction CAc and sub-fraction CSc2 strongly increased on most bacteria strains as their MICs significantly decreased. Sub-fraction CSc2 inhibited the H(+)-ATPase proton pumps and altered growth kinetic of Escherichia coli ATCC8739. CONCLUSION: The overall results justify the traditional use of C. sieberiana for the treatment of bacterial infections.",2662-7671 (Electronic) 2662-7671 (Linking),2020 Nov 12,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1070-1236'],"['10.1186/s12906-020-03148-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12906-020-03148-3 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Cassia sieberiana', 'Efflux pumps', 'Gram negative bacteria', 'Infectious diseases', 'Multidrug resistance']",,,

In 2017, the Saudi National Action Plan (SNAP) implemented several strategies to overcome AR. Here, to better understand the effectiveness of that plan, we evaluated the rates of AR, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positivity, and multi-drug resistance (MDR) among gram-negative bacteria in a private Saudi hospital. Methods: This retrospective study included all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of gram-negative bacterial infection from January 2017 to December 2019. Identification of bacterial strains was performed using VITEK 2 ID-GNB cards, while AR, ESBL, and MDR were determined using AST-No. 12 cards, both used as recommended by the manufacturer. Cards were loaded into a VITEK 2 system for examination. Results: A total of 4760 isolated gram-negative bacteria were collected. The most isolated organism was Escherichia coli, with 2585/4760 (54.30%) strains, and the least was Providencia stuartii, with 55/4760 (1.16%) strains. A total of 1328/4760 (27.90%) clinical isolates were ESBL-positive, and 851/4760 (17.88%) possessed MDR. Escherichia coli was also the most frequently isolated as having ESBL activity and MDR, with 772/1328 (58.13%) and 292/851 (34.31%) isolates, respectively. Between 2017 and 2019, the rates of ESBL and MDR were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) for most bacteria, except for Salmonella species, which showed increased resistance to antibiotics. Conclusion: Our findings revealed that the rates of AR, ESBL, and MDR reduced over time, which suggests the SNAP is effective at overcoming AR risk.",1178-6973 (Print) 1178-6973 (Linking),2020,,"['10.2147/IDR.S265000 [doi]', '265000 [pii]']",['eng'],New Zealand,"['Saudi Arabi', 'VITEK', 'antibiotic resistance', 'gram-negative bacteria', 'multi-drug resistance']",['(c) 2020 Alabdullatif and Alrehaili.'],,

The hospital department in which the patients were treated and the drug susceptibility characteristics of the P. stuartii isolates were recorded. RESULTS: Among the 76 patients, the lung was the most common site of infection, and intensive care unit was the main hospital department. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase screening revealed expression by all 76 isolates of P. stuartii. Of the 76 isolates, 92.1% exhibited multiple drug resistance or extensive drug resistance. P. stuartii isolates were sensitive to cefepime and imipenem, but not to other beta-lactam antibiotics. Twenty isolates were resistant to all 21 types of antibiotics. Of the 20 patients infected with extensively drug-resistant isolates, nine (45%) died. CONCLUSIONS: Drug resistance is increasing in P. stuartii.

Worldwide, infections caused by carbapenem-resistant (CR) Gram-negative bacilli have dramatically increased. Among the CR-Gram-negative bacilli, those producing carbapenemases, such as NDM-1, are the main concern. Different Enterobacterales harboring NDM-1 have been reported lately. Providencia stuartii, a member of the Morganellaceae family, is ubiquitous in the environment, but is also known to cause nosocomial infections.

As a result of the genomic analysis thirteen resistance genes, including three to beta-lactams (blaOXA-1, blaTEM-1, blaNDM-1), four to aminoglycosides (aphA6, aac(3)-IId, aac(2')-Ia, aac(6')-Ib-cr5), one to sulfonamides (sul1), two to chloramphenicol (catB3, catA3), one to rifampicin, one to bleomycin (ble), and one to tetracycline (tet(B)) were found. Moreover, a variety of mobile genetic elements, such as insertion sequences, plasmids and phage- related sequences, were found within P. stuartii genomes.

Macrophages polarization is essential in infection control. Llipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays an essential role in host innate immune system-pathogen interaction. The LPS structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa modifies in the adaptation of this pathogen to biofilm-related chronic infection.Gap statement. There have been several studies on LPS induced polarization of human and mouse macrophages with different results. And it was reported that the lipid A structure of the LPS derived from biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 was modified.Aim. This study aimed to investigate the effect and the involved pathway of LPS from biofilm-forming PAO1 on human and murine macrophage polarization.Methodology. LPS was isolated from biofilm-forming and planktonic PAO1 and quantified. Then the LPS was added to PMA-differentiated human macrophage THP-1 cells and Raw264.7 murine macrophage cells. The expression of iNOS, Arg-1, IL4, TNF-alpha, CCL3, and CCL22 was analysed in the different cell lines. The expression of TICAM-1 and MyD88 in human THP-1 macrophages was quantified by Western blot. PAO1 infected macrophages at different polarization states, and the intracellular bacterial growth in macrophages was evaluated.Results. LPS from biofilm-forming PAO1 induced more marked hyperinflammatory responses in THP-1 and Raw264.7 macrophages than LPS derived from planktonic PAO1, and these responses were related to the up-regulation of MyD88. Intracellular growth of PAO1 was significantly increased in THP-1 macrophages polarized by LPS from biofilm-forming PAO1, but decreased both in THP-1 and Raw264.7 macrophages polarized by LPS from planktonic PAO1.Conclusion.

Kongs-67 retrieved from Kongsfjorden, an Arctic fjord, has been investigated to understand the molecular machinery required for microbial association and survival in a polar fjord. The genome size of Kongs-67 was 4.5 Mb and was found to be closely related to the Antarctic P. pelagia strain CL-AP6. This genome encodes for chemotaxis response regulator proteins (CheABB1RR2VWYZ), chemoreceptors (methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins), and flagellar system proteins (FliCDEFGOPMN, FlhABF, FlgBCDEFGHIJKL, and MotAB proteins) vital in cellular interactions in the dynamic fjord environment. A high proportion of genes were assigned to biofilm formation (pgaABCD operon) and signal transduction protein categories (EnvZ/OmpR, CpxA/CpxR, PhoR/PhoB, PhoQ) indicating that the biofilm formation in Kongs-67 could be tightly regulated in response to the availability of signalling-metabolites. The genome of Kongs-67 encoded for HemBCD, CbiA, CobABNSTOQCDP, and BtuBFR proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and transport along with proteins for siderophore-mediated iron channelling (PchR, Fur protein, FpvA); crucial in a microbial association. The genomes of Arctic strain Kongs-67 and Antarctic strain CL-AP6 were similar which is indicative of retainment of the core genes in the polar Pseudomonas strains that could be vital in conferring evolutionary adaptation for its survival in a polar fjord.

Interestingly, the checkerboard data showed that Ru(II)-3 selectively exhibited synergism with aminoglycoside antibiotics. More importantly, the observed synergetic effect might be attributed to the inhibition of the regulatory function of SaCcpA.

However, the need for coadministration with an antibiotic and the potential susceptibility of PslG to proteolysis highlights the need for an effective delivery system. Here, we compared liposomes versus lipid liquid crystal nanoparticles (LCNPs) loaded with PslG and tobramycin as potential formulation approaches to (1) protect PslG from proteolysis, (2) trigger the enzyme's release in the presence of bacteria, and (3) improve the total antimicrobial effect in vitro and in vivo in a Caenorhabditis elegans infection model. LCNPs were an effective formulation strategy for PslG and tobramycin that better protected the enzyme against proteolysis, triggered and sustained the release of PslG, improved the antimicrobial effect by 10-100-fold, and increased the survival of C. elegans infected with P. aeruginosa. Digestible LCNPs had the advantage of triggering the enzyme's release in the presence of bacteria. However, compared to nondigestible LCNPs, negligible differences arose between the LCNPs' ability to protect PslG from proteolysis and potentiate the antimicrobial activity in combination with tobramycin. In C. elegans, the improved antimicrobial efficacy was comparable to tobramycin-LCNPs, although the PslG + tobramycin-LCNPs achieved a greater than 10-fold reduction in bacteria compared to the unformulated combination.

How plants produce specific responses through these common signaling intermediates remains elusive. With the help of reverse-genetics approaches, we describe here the mechanism underlying trade-offs in pepper (Capsicum annuum) between growth, immunity and thermotolerance. The NAC-type transcription factor CaNAC2c was induced by HTS and Ralstonia solanacearum infection (RSI). CaNAC2c inhibited pepper growth, promoted immunity against RSI by activating jasmonate-mediated immunity and H2O2 accumulation, and promoted HTS responses by activating Heat shock factor A5 (CaHSFA5) transcription and blocking H2O2 accumulation. We show that CaNAC2c physically interacts with CaHSP70 and CaNAC029 in a context-specific manner. Upon HTS, CaNAC2c-CaHSP70 interaction in the nucleus protected CaNAC2c from degradation and resulted in the activation of thermotolerance by increasing CaNAC2c binding and transcriptional activation of its target promoters. CaNAC2c did not induce immunity-related genes under HTS, likely due to the degradation of CaNAC029 by the 26S proteasome. Upon RSI, CaNAC2c interacted with CaNAC029 in the nucleus and activated jasmonate-mediated immunity but was prevented from activating thermotolerance-related genes. In non-stressed plants, CaNAC2c was tethered outside the nucleus by interaction with CaHSP70, and thus was unable to activate either immunity or thermotolerance. Our results indicate that pepper growth, immunity and thermotolerance are coordinately and tightly regulated by CaNAC2c via its inducible expression and differential interaction with CaHSP70 and CaNAC029.",1532-2548 (Electronic) 0032-0889 (Linking),2021 Apr 26,,"['6255767 [pii]', '10.1093/plphys/kiab190 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['Capsicum annuum', 'HSP70', 'NAC', 'NAC029', 'trade-off']","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

However, the diversity and structure of airborne bacteria in waste-associated environments are still not clearly understood. The purpose of this study was to assess airborne bacterial community in electronic waste dismantling site and a waste transfer station based on culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. A total of 229 isolates were obtained from four airborne sites collected from residential area, electronic industrial park, and office area in or near an electronic waste dismantling site and a waste transfer station in Southern China in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Most of the isolates were isolated from air for the first time and 14 potentially novel species were identified by Sanger sequencing. Bacterial communities in waste-associated bioaerosols were predominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Abundant genera (>1%) included Paracaedibacteraceae (uncultured EF667926), Ralstonia, Chroococcidiopsis, Chitinophagaceae (uncultured FN428761), Sphingobium, and Heliimonas. One-third of the species in these genera were uncultured approximately. Differences community structure existed in airborne bacterial diversity among different sampling sites. These results showed that waste-associated environments have unique bacterial diversity.

Identification of avirulence type III secreted effectors recognized by specific disease resistance proteins in host plant species is an important step towards developing durable resistance in crops. In the present study, we show that R. solanacearum effector RipJ functions as an avirulence determinant in Solanum pimpinellifolium LA2093. 10 candidate avirulence effectors were shortlisted based on the effector repertoire comparison between avirulent Pe_9 and virulent Pe_1 strain. Infection assays with transgenic Pe_1 strain individually carrying a candidate avirulence effector from Pe_9 revealed that only RipJ elicits strong bacterial wilt resistance in S. pimpinellifolium LA2093. Furthermore, we identified that several RipJ natural variants do not induce bacterial wilt resistance in S. pimpinellifolium LA2093. RipJ belongs to the YopJ family of acetyltransferases. Our sequence analysis indicated the presence of partially conserved putative catalytic residues. Interestingly, the conserved amino acid residues in the acetyltransferase catalytic triad are not required for effector-triggered immunity. In addition, we show that RipJ does not auto-acetylate its lysine residues. Our study reports the identification of the first R. solanacearum avirulence protein that triggers bacterial wilt resistance in tomato. We expect that our discovery of RipJ as an avirulence protein will accelerate the development of bacterial wilt-resistant tomato varieties in the future.",0894-0282 (Print) 0894-0282 (Linking),2021 Apr 21,,['10.1094/MPMI-09-20-0256-R [doi]'],['eng'],United States,,,,

We combined automatic phenotyping and tissue/xylem quantitative metabolomics of infected tomato plants to decipher the dynamics of bacterial wilt. Daily acquisition of physiological parameters such as transpiration and growth were performed. Measurements allowed us to identify a tipping point in bacterial wilt dynamics. At this tipping point, the reached bacterial density brutally disrupts plant physiology and rapidly induces its death. We compared the metabolic and physiological signatures of the infection with drought stress, and found that similar changes occur. Quantitative dynamics of xylem content enabled us to identify glutamine (and asparagine) as primary resources R. solanacearum consumed during its colonization phase. An abundant production of putrescine was also observed during the infection process and was strongly correlated with in planta bacterial growth.

However, there are no effective measures to control bacterial wilt. The reason is the lack of research on the pathogenic mechanism of bacterial wilt. RESULTS: Here, we report the complete genome of a toxic Ralstonia solanacearum species complex strain, Rs-P.362200, a peanut pathogen, with a total genome size of 5.86 Mb, encoding 5056 genes and the average G + C content of 67%. Among the coding genes, 75 type III effector proteins and 12 pseudogenes were predicted. Phylogenetic analysis of 41 strains including Rs-P.362200 shows that genetic distance mainly depended on geographic origins then phylotypes and host species, which associated with the complexity of the strain. The distribution and numbers of effectors and other virulence factors changed among different strains. Comparative genomic analysis showed that 29 families of 113 genes were unique to this strain compared with the other four pathogenic strains. Through the analysis of specific genes, two homologous genes (gene ID: 2_657 and 3_83), encoding virulence protein (such as RipP1) may be associated with the host range of the Rs-P.362200 strain. It was found that the bacteria contained 30 pathogenicity islands and 6 prophages containing 378 genes, 7 effectors and 363 genes, 8 effectors, respectively, which may be related to the mechanism of horizontal gene transfer and pathogenicity evaluation. Although the hosts of HA4-1 and Rs-P.362200 strains are the same, they have specific genes to their own genomes. The number of genomic islands and prophages in HA4-1 genome is more than that in Rs-P.36220, indicating a rapid change of the bacterial wilt pathogens. CONCLUSION: The complete genome sequence analysis of peanut bacterial wilt pathogen enhanced the information of R. solanacearum genome.

However, their dependence on the costly cofactor, NAD(P)H remains a challenge which must be addressed. Here, we engineered a thermotolerant phosphite dehydrogenase from Ralstonia sp. 4506 (RsPtxD) by relaxing the cofactor specificity for a highly efficient and robust NADPH regeneration system. The five amino acid residues, Cys174-Pro178, located at the C-terminus of beta7-strand region in the Rossmann-fold domain of RsPtxD, were changed by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in four mutants with a significantly increased preference for NADP. The catalytic efficiency of mutant RsPtxDHARRA for NADP (K cat/K M)(NADP) was 44.1 muM(-1) min(-1), which was the highest among the previously reported phosphite dehydrogenases. Moreover, the RsPtxDHARRA mutant exhibited high thermostability at 45 degrees C for up to 6 h and high tolerance to organic solvents, when bound with NADP. We also demonstrated the applicability of RsPtxDHARRA as an NADPH regeneration system in the coupled reaction of chiral conversion of 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimic acid by the thermophilic shikimate dehydrogenase of Thermus thermophilus HB8 at 45 degrees C, which could not be supported by the parent RsPtxD enzyme.

Historically, the geographic range of A. americanum was restricted to the southeastern United States. However, recent tick surveys identified the progressive northward invasion of A. americanum, contributing to the increased number of patients with febrile illnesses of unknown etiology after a tick bite in the northeastern United States. While serological evidence strongly suggests that patients are infected with R. amblyommatis, the virulence potential of R. amblyommatis is not well established.

Similar to other pathogenic spotted fever rickettsiae, R. amblyommatis replicated intracellularly within the cytoplasm of tissue culture cells. Interestingly, R. amblyommatis displayed defective attachment to microvascular endothelial cells.

In this Review, we summarise data regarding Y pestis transmission by human lice in the context of genomic evolution and co-transmission of other major epidemic deadly pathogens throughout human history, with the aim of broadening our view of plague transmission. Experimental models support the efficiency of human lice as plague vectors through infected faeces, which suggest that Y pestis could be a louse-borne disease, similar to Borrelia recurrentis, Rickettsia prowazekii, and Bartonella quintana. Studies have shown that louse-borne outbreaks often involve multiple pathogens, and several cases of co-transmission of Y pestis and B quintana have been reported. Furthermore, an exclusive louse-borne bacterium, namely B recurrentis, was found to be circulating in northern Europe during the second plague pandemic (14th-18th century). Current data make it possible to attribute large historical pandemics to multiple bacteria, and suggests that human lice probably played a preponderant role in the interhuman transmission of plague and pathogen co-transmission during previous large epidemics, including plague pandemics.",1474-4457 (Electronic) 1473-3099 (Linking),2021 Feb,,"['S1473-3099(20)30487-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30487-4 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Paleoserology was applied to the indirect detection of lice-borne pathogens in seven skeletons exhumed from a 16th-17th century suspected military burial site (Auxi-le-Chateau); and 14 civils exhumed from a 5th-13th century burial site (Saint-Mont). Direct detection of pathogens was performed using quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: In Auxi-le-Chateau, paleoserology yielded 7/7 interpretable paleoserums including 7/7 positives for B. recurrentis including one also positive for B. quintana. In Saint-Mont, paleoserology yielded 8/14 interpretable paleoserums and none reacted against any of the four pathogens. Antibodies against R. prowazekii and Y. pestis were not detected. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in the military burial site of Auxi-le-Chateau than in the civil burial site of Saint-Mont. Real-time PCR detection of B. quintana yielded 5/21 positive (3 at Saint-Mont and 2 at Auxi-le-Chateau) whereas B. recurrentis was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Paleoserology unmasked an outbreak of relapsing B. recurrentis fever in one 16th - 17th century military garrison, missed by real-time PCR.

Pediculosis due to head lice occurred each year throughout the world and several pathogenic bacteria, which are usually associated with body lice, are increasingly detected in them. In Gabon, where this pediculosis is still widespread, there is a lack of data on genetic diversity of head lice and their associated bacteria. METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the phylogeny of head lice collected in Gabon and their associated bacteria, using molecular tools. Between 26 March and 11 April 2018, 691 head lice were collected from 86 women in Franceville. We studied the genetic diversity of these lice based on the cytochrome b gene, then we screened them for DNA of Bartonella quintana, Borrelia spp., Acinetobacter spp., Yersinia pestis, Rickettsia spp., R. prowazekii, Anaplasma spp. and C. burnetii, using real time or standard PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Overall 74.6% of studied lice belonged to Clade A, 25.3% to Clade C and 0.1% to Clade E. The phylogenetic analysis of 344 head lice yielded 45 variable positions defining 13 different haplotypes from which 8 were novel. Bacterial screening revealed the presence of Borrelia spp. DNA in 3 (0.4%) of 691 head lice belonging to Clade A and infesting one individual. This Borrelia is close to B. theileri (GenBank: MN621894). Acinetobacter spp. DNA has been detected in 39 (25%) of the 156 screened lice; of these 13 (8.3%) corresponded to A. baumannii. Acinetobacter nosocomialis (n = 2) and A. pittii (n = 1) were also recorded. CONCLUSIONS: To of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the genetic diversity of head lice from Gabon. It appears that Clade C is the second most important clade in Gabon, after Clade A which is known to have a global distribution.

Murine typhus, caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Rickettsia typhi, remains a severe disease in humans. However, the mechanisms by which R. typhi effector molecules contribute to internalization by induced phagocytosis and subsequent phagosomal escape into the cytosol to facilitate the intracellular growth of the bacteria remain ill-defined. Here, we characterize a new molecule, Risk1, as a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) secreted effector and the first bacterial secretory kinase with both class I and III PI3K activities. Inactivation of Risk1 PI3K activities reduced the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate within the host, which consequently diminished host colonization by R. typhi During infection, Risk1 targets the Rab5-EEA1-phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] signaling axis to promote bacterial phagosomal escape. Subsequently, R. typhi undergoes ubiquitination and induces host autophagy; however, maturation to autolysosomes is subverted to support intracellular growth. Intriguingly, only enzymatically active Risk1 binds the Beclin-1 core complex and contributes to R. typhi-induced autophagosome formation. In sum, our data suggest that Risk1, with dual class I and class III PI3K activities, alters host PI metabolism and consequently subverts intracellular trafficking to facilitate intracellular growth of R. typhi IMPORTANCE Rickettsia species are Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria that infect a wide range of eukaryotes and vertebrates. In particular, human body louse-borne Rickettsia prowazekii and flea-borne Rickettsia typhi have historically plagued humankind and continue to reemerge globally. The unavailability of vaccines and limited effectiveness of antibiotics late in infection place lethality rates up to 30%, highlighting the need to elucidate the mechanisms of Rickettsia pathogenicity in greater detail. Here, we characterize a new effector, Risk1, as a secreted phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) with unique dual class I and class III activities. Risk1 is required for host colonization, and its vacuolar phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate generation modulates endosomal trafficking to arrest autophagosomal maturation.

Twentieth-century public health interventions led to dramatic decreases in incidence; little is known about the contemporary TGR prevalence because neither disease is nationally notifiable. We summarized administrative claims data in a commercially insured population to examine trends in TGR medical encounters. We analysed data from 2003 to 2016 IBM(R) MarketScan(R) Commercial Databases to identify persons with inpatient or outpatient visits with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification TGR-specific code. We summarized epidemiologic characteristics associated with incident diagnosis. We identified 1,799 patients diagnosed with a TGR. Patients resided in 46 states, and most were female (n = 1,019/1,799; 56.6%); the median age was 42 years (range: 0-64 years). Epidemic typhus (n = 931/1,799; 51.8%) was the most common TGRs, followed by murine typhus (n = 722/1,799; 40.1%). The majority of TGR patients were diagnosed in an outpatient setting (n = 1,725/1,799; 95.9%); among hospitalized patients, the majority received a murine typhus diagnosis (n = 67/74; 90.5%). TGRs are rarely diagnosed diseases. More patients were diagnosed with epidemic than murine typhus, even though R. prowazekii transmission requires body louse or flying squirrel exposure.

This presumed ancestral synteny decreases with genome size across megaviral families at large and within Poxviridae. In this study, analyses focus on Phycodnaviridae, a polyphyletic group of giant viruses infecting Haplophyta, Stramenopiles, and other algae, using syntenies between algal mitogene arrangements and chloroplast genomes and Rickettsia prowazekii as positive controls. Mitogene alignment qualities with Rickettsia are much higher than with viral genomes. Mitogenome synteny with some viruses is higher, for others lower than with Rickettsia, despite lower alignments qualities. In some algae, syntenies among cohosted chloroplast, virus, and mitochondrion are higher, in others lower than expected. This suggests gene order coevolution in cohosted genomes, different coregulations of organelle metabolisms for different algae, and viral mitogenome mimicry, to hijack organelle-committed cellular resources and/or escape cellular defenses/genetic immunity systems. This principle might explain high synteny between human mitochondria and the pathogenic endocellular alphaproteobacterium R. prowazekii beyond common ancestry.

The sera obtained were tested by an indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-Rickettsia antibodies. Overall, 5.7% (4/70) of the horses reacted to R. rickettsii antigens. Ticks were collected from 18.6% (13/70) of the horses and were identified as A. sculptum and Dermacentor nitens. Despite being a non-endemic area, seropositive animals were identified in our study, suggesting circulation of rickettsial agents in the region.

Feeding primarily on dogs, members of the complex also feed incidentally on humans, potentially transmitting disease agents such as Rickettsia rickettsii, R. conorii, and Ehrlichia species. There are two genetic Rh. sanguineus lineages in North America, designated as the temperate and tropical lineages, which had occurred in discrete locations, although there is now range overlap in parts of California and Arizona. Rh. sanguineus in Europe are reportedly more aggressive toward humans during hot weather, increasing the risk of pathogen transmission to humans. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of hot weather on choice between humans and dog hosts among tropical and temperate lineage Rh. sanguineus individuals. Ticks in a two-choice olfactometer migrated toward a dog or human in trials at room (23.5 degrees C) or high temperature (38 degrees C). At 38 degrees C, 2.5 times more tropical lineage adults chose humans compared with room temperature, whereas temperate lineage adults demonstrated a 66% reduction in preference for dogs and a slight increase in preference for humans. Fewer nymphs chose either host at 38 degrees C than at room temperature in both lineages. These results demonstrate that risk of disease transmission to humans may be increased during periods of hot weather, where either lineage is present, and that hot weather events associated with climatic change may result in more frequent rickettsial disease outbreaks.",1476-1645 (Electronic) 0002-9637 (Linking),2021 Apr 5,,"['10.4269/ajtmh.20-1376 [doi]', 'tpmd201376 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

In North America, two species in the spotted fever group of Rickettsia have been conclusively associated with disease of humans: Rickettsia rickettsii, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Rickettsia parkeri, the cause of R. parkeri rickettsiosis. Previous work in our lab demonstrated non-endothelial parasitism by another pathogenic SFG Rickettsia species, Rickettsia conorii, within THP-1-derived macrophages, and we have hypothesized that this growth characteristic may be an underappreciated aspect of rickettsial pathogenesis in mammalian hosts. In this work, we demonstrated that multiple other recognized human pathogenic species of Rickettsia, including R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, Rickettsia africae, and Rickettsiaakari can grow within target endothelial cells as well as within PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. In contrast, Rickettsia bellii, a Rickettsia species not associated with disease of humans, and R. rickettsii strain Iowa, an avirulent derivative of pathogenic R. rickettsii, could invade both cell types but proliferate only within endothelial cells. Further analysis revealed that similar to previous studies on R. conorii, other recognized pathogenic Rickettsia species could grow within the cytosol of THP-1-derived macrophages and avoided localization with two different markers of lysosomal compartments; LAMP-2 and cathepsin D. R. bellii, on the other hand, demonstrated significant co-localization with lysosomal compartments. Collectively, these findings suggest that the ability of pathogenic rickettsial species to establish a niche within macrophage-like cells could be an important factor in their ability to cause disease in mammals. These findings also suggest that analysis of growth within mammalian phagocytic cells may be useful to predict the pathogenic potential of newly isolated and identified Rickettsia species.",2076-0817 (Print) 2076-0817 (Linking),2021 Feb 19,,"['pathogens10020228 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens10020228 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['Rickettsia', 'THP-1 cells', 'pathogenesis', 'proliferation']",,,

Although cases are often attributed to Rickettsia rickettsii, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, multiple other Rickettsia pathogens are present in North America. We conducted multiple-host surveillance of domestic, synanthropic, and sylvatic mammals and their ectoparasites to investigate the ecology of Rickettsia species in this region. A total of 499 mammals, including 83 dogs, 23 wild carnivores, five lagomorphs, and 388 rodents were sampled, and 413 fleas and 447 ticks belonging to 15 and 4 species, respectively, were collected during 2017 and 2018. We detected Rickettsia spp. DNA in one blood sample of coyote (Canis latrans), 11 ear tissues of rodents (10.6%), and 79 ectoparasites (9.5%). Of the 64 Rickettsia-positive fleas, 54 were Echidnophaga gallinacea and 10 were Pulex simulans, while of the 15 ticks, 11 were Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. and four Ixodes pacificus. The DNA sequence alignment of gltA and ompB regions revealed one and ten genetic variants of Rickettsia spp., respectively. These variants were clustered in clades of zoonotic species (R. felis, R. massiliae, R. parkeri, R. rickettsii, and R. typhi) and organisms of unknown pathogenic significance (R. asembonensis and Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae). The finding of a coyote infected with R. rickettsii and the multiple zoonotic SFG rickettsial agents in the study area suggest that: 1) wild canids could serve as an amplifying host for RMSF, an alternate host for Rh. sanguineus s.l. ticks, and a means to spread infection and ticks over large areas; and 2) at least some of the human rickettsiosis cases attributed to R. rickettsii could be caused by other Rickettsia species.

Here, we used amplicon-based NGS to species identify Rickettsia and their arthropod hosts from entomological surveillance. METHODS: During 2015-2016, we screened 1825 samples of rodents and ectoparasites collected from rodents and domestic mammals (dog, cat, and cattle) across Thailand for Rickettsia. The citrate synthase gene was amplified to identify Rickettsia to species, while the Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI) and subunit II (COII) genes were used as target genes for ectoparasite identification. All target gene amplicons were pooled for library preparation and sequenced with Illumina MiSeq platform. RESULT: The highest percentage of Rickettsia DNA was observed in fleas collected from domestic animals (56%) predominantly dogs. Only a few samples of ticks from domestic animals, rodent fleas, and rodent tissue were positive for Rickettisia DNA. NGS based characterization of Rickettsia by host identified Rickettsia asembonensis as the most common bacteria in positive fleas collected from dogs (83.2%) while ""Candidatus Rickettsia senegalensis"" was detected in only 16.8% of Rickettsia positive dog fleas. Sequence analysis of COI and COII revealed that almost all fleas collected from dogs were Ctenocephalides felis orientis. Other Rickettsia species were detected by NGS including Rickettsia heilongjiangensis from two Haemaphysalis hystricis ticks, and Rickettsia typhi in two rodent tissue samples. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the utility of NGS for high-throughput sequencing in the species characterization/identification of bacteria and ectoparasite for entomological surveillance of rickettsiae.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the establishment of a vegetation barrier (VB) on small-scale sustainable farms could prevent the transmission of Salmonella and E. coli to nearby fresh produce fields. A 5-layer VB (31 x 49 m) was constructed between a dairy farm, a poultry farm, and a nearby produce field. Fresh produce (i.e., romaine lettuce and tomato), animal feces, and environmental (i.e., air, soil, and barrier) samples were collected for 15 months from 2018 to 2019. Four replicates of soil and fresh produce samples were taken from three plots located 10 m, 61 m, and 122 m away from the respective animal locations and processed for Salmonella and E. coli. Air and vegetative strip samples were sampled at 15-day intervals. Multiple colonies were processed from each positive sample, and a total of 143 positive Salmonella (n = 15) and E. coli (n = 128) isolates were retrieved from the soil, produce, air, and fecal samples. Interestingly, 18.2% of the Salmonella and E. coli isolates (n = 26) were recovered from fresh produce (n = 9) samples. Surprisingly, Salmonella isolates (n = 9) were only found in fecal (n = 3) samples collected from the dairy pasture. Data analysis suggests that the VB is an effective tool at reducing the transmission of E. coli and Salmonella from animal farms to fresh produce fields. However, based on phenotypic and genotypic testing, it is clear that fecal samples from animal farms are not the only source of pathogen contamination. This indicates that the environment (e.g., soil and wind), as well as the initial setup of the farm (e.g., proximity to service roads and produce plot placement), can contribute to the contamination of fresh produce. Our study recommends the need for more effective bioremediation and prevention control measures to use in conjunction with VBs to reduce pathogen transmission.",1879-3460 (Electronic) 0168-1605 (Linking),2021 Apr 14,,"['S0168-1605(21)00155-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.109196 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Dairy', 'Distance', 'Poultry', 'Repetitive PCR', 'Seasonality', 'Wind']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

It causes an intestinal imbalance and the microbial toxins found in the gastrointestinal tract induce symptoms such as diarrhea. Coffee contains active ingredients such as antioxidants and is used as an anti-inflammatory agent by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the body. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine the interaction between Lampung's robusta coffee and tissue damage in chickens infected by S. enteritidis. Methods: This study used first-day-old Isa brown layer chickens (n = 60), which were divided into five treatment groups. The negative control group consisted of healthy and normal chickens, whereas the positive control group consisted of chickens infected with S. enteritidis bacteria at a concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml. Groups T1, T2, and T3 were given coffee extract with doses of 500 mg/kg BW (low dose), 1,000 mg/kg BW (moderate dose), and 1,500 mg/kg BW (high dose), respectively, and then infected with S. enteritidis bacteria at a concentration of 10(8) CFU/ml. The coffee extract and bacteria were given orally via a feeding tube at a volume of 0.5 ml per chick. The extract was given for 14 days (from day 3 to day 16), and the bacteria were given on days 16 and 17. On day 18, the chickens were necropsied. The malondialdehyde (MDA) level was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance test with the GLM procedure (<0.05), while the tissue histopath was analyzed using a descriptive qualitative study to examine the ileal damage. Results: The results showed that the MDA levels (nmol/l) decreased in treatment groups T1, T2, and T3 compared to the positive control. On the contrary, we found improvements in the ileum histopathology of group T1 and T2 in the form of normal and regular intestinal epithelium arrangement of the ileum, long intestinal villi, and decreased total leukocytes.

Retail meat is a major source of human salmonellosis. However, comparative genomic analyses of S. enterica isolates from retail meat from different sources in China are lacking. A total of 341 S. enterica strains were isolated from retail meat in sixteen districts of Beijing, China, at three different time points (January 1st, May 1st, and October 1st) in 2017. Comparative genomics was performed to investigate the genetic diversity, virulence and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) profiles of these isolates. The most common serotype was S. Enteritidis (203/341, 59.5%), which dominated among isolates from three different time points during the year. Laboratory retesting confirmed the accuracy of the serotyping results predicted by the Salmonella In Silico Typing Resource (SISTR) (96.5%). The pangenome of the 341 S. enterica isolates contained 13,931 genes, and the core genome contained 3,635 genes. Higher Salmonella phage 118970 sal3 (219/341, 64.2%) and Gifsy-2 (206/341, 60.4%) prevalence contributed to the diversity of the accessory genes, especially those with unknown functions. IncFII(S), IncX1, and IncFIB(S) plasmid replicons were more common in these isolates and were major sources of horizontally acquired foreign genes. The virulence gene profile showed fewer virulence genes associated with type III secretion systems in certain isolates from chicken. A total of 88 different ARGs were found in the 341 isolates. Three beta-lactamases, namely, bla CTX - M - 55 (n = 15), bla CTX - M - 14 (n = 11), and bla CTX - M - 65 (n = 11), were more prevalent in retail meats.

A study was conducted to determine the concentration of peroxyacetic acid (PAA) which would be equivalent to 100-200 ppm chlorine (Cl) in reducing target organisms under the required washing conditions for shell eggs. Three isolates of Salmonella spp. (Enteritidis, Braenderup, and Typhimurium), as well as Enterobacter cloacae were used as inocula. Sanitizing treatments were negative control; deionized water; 100 and 200 ppm Cl; and 50-500 ppm PAA (7 concentrations). Considering all isolates tested, 100 and 200 ppm chlorine had 2.6 and 2.3 log cfu/mL cultural organisms remaining on shell surface; 50 and 100 ppm peracetic acid had 1.9 and 1.0 log cfu/mL cultural organisms remaining, respectively, compared with untreated control average of 3.8 log cfu/mL (P < 0.001). Salmonella Typhimurium was least resistant to shell sanitizer treatments. Peroxyacetic acid concentrations >250 ppm did not produce significant reductions in microbial populations as PAA concentration increased. Culturing for the prevalence of viable and injured organisms, 400-500 ppm PAA resulted in fewer eggs (P < 0.0001) being positive for Salmonella spp. E. cloacae was culturable via enrichment from 99.4% of inoculated eggs, regardless of sanitizer treatment. The results of this study indicate that 50-100 ppm PAA is equivalent to 100-200 ppm chlorine in reducing egg surface microorganisms. The use of 400-500 ppm PAA resulted in a lower incidence of viable, but not culturable, Salmonella spp. on the shell surface.

The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of pathogens has become a lower-cost and more accessible genotyping tool providing many gene analysis possibilities. This study provided an in silico investigation of 129 virulence genes, including plasmidial and bacteriophage genes from Brazilian strains' public Salmonella genomes. The frequency analysis of the four most sequenced serovars and a temporal analysis over the past four decades was also performed. The NCBI sequence reads archive (SRA) database comprised 1077 Salmonella public whole-genome sequences of strains isolated in Brazil between 1968 and 2018. Among the 1077 genomes, 775 passed in Salmonella in silico Typing (SISTR) quality control, which also identified 41 different serovars in which the four most prevalent were S. Enteritidis, S.

Pullorum disease, caused by Salmonella Pullorum, seriously threatens the poultry industry. Many previous studies were focused on the epidemiological characteristics of Salmonella infections in conventional antibiotic use poultry. However, little is known about Salmonella infections in chicken flocks fed on antibiotic-free diets. Herein, we investigated and compared Salmonella infections in three Chinese native breeders fed on antibiotic-free diets, including the Luhua, Langya, and Qingjiaoma chickens, and one conventional breeder, the Bairi chicken, via analyzing 360 dead embryos in 2019. The results showed that the main Salmonella serotypes detected in a total of 155 isolates were S. Pullorum (82.6%) and S. Enteritidis (17.4%). Coinfection with two serotypes of Salmonella was specifically found in Bairi chicken. The sequence type (ST) in S. Pullorum was ST92 (n = 96) and ST2151 (n = 32), whereas only ST11 (n = 27) was found in S. Enteritidis. The Salmonella isolates from three breeder flocks fed on antibiotic-free diets exhibited phenotypic heterogeneity with a great variety of drug resistance spectrum. Most of the isolates among three chicken breeds Luhua (64.9%, 50/77), Langya (60%, 12/20) and Qingjiaoma (58.3%, 7/12) fed on antibiotic-free diets were resistant to only one antibiotic (erythromycin), whereas the rate of resistance to one antibiotic in conventional Bairi chicken isolates was only 4.3% (2/46). The multidrug-resistance rate in Salmonella isolates from layer flocks fed on antibiotic-free diets (20.2%, 22/109) was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower than that from chickens fed on conventional diets (93.5%, 43/46). However, high rate of resistance to erythromycin (97.4%~100%) and streptomycin (26%~41.7%) were also found among three breeder flocks fed on antibiotic-free diets, indicating resistance to these antibiotics likely spread before antibiotic-free feeding in poultry farms.

Typhi ZH9 strain, which has an excellent safety record in clinical trials, to introduce two S. Paratyphi A immunogenic elements: flagellin H:a and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O:2. We first replaced the native S. Typhi fliC gene encoding flagellin with the highly homologous fliC gene from S. Paratyphi A using Xer-cise technology. Next, we replaced the S. Typhi rfbE gene encoding tyvelose epimerase with a spacer sequence to enable the sustained expression of O:2 LPS and prevent its conversion to O:9 through tyvelose epimerase activity. The resulting new strain, ZH9PA, incorporated these two genetic changes and exhibited comparable growth kinetics to the parental ZH9 strain. A formulation containing both ZH9 and ZH9PA strains together constitutes a new bivalent vaccine candidate that targets both S. Typhi and S.

METHODS: The study analyzed 230 stool specimens that were cultured on XLD, MacConkey agar and GN broth. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to identify the Salmonella genus. The antibiotic resistance profiles and the frequency of quinolone and integron genes were obtained. RESULTS: Out of 230 samples of infectious diarrhea, 21 (9.1%) cases of Salmonella spp. were identified using culture methods. Another 28 (12.1%) samples had positive PCR results, with S. serovar Paratyphi B and C (9/21; 42.8%) and S. Typhi (3/21; 14.3%) being the most recognized. The highest antibiotic resistance rates were found for nalidixic acid (15/21; 71.4%), tetracycline (9/21; 42.8%). However, six (28.5%) of isolates were found resistant to cotrimoxazole, ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Among the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants, qnrS, qnrA, and qnrB were positive in (9/15; 60%), (6/15; 40%) and (3/15; 20%) of the isolates, respectively. Class 1 and 2 integrons were identified in 15 (71.4%) and 3 (14.3%) isolates, respectively. CONCLUSION: High rates of quinolone resistant and low frequency of MDR Salmonella spp. isolates were identified in central Iran, similar to findings in other parts of Asia. To prevent the spread of these resistant strains, the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella spp. isolates should be under constant surveillance, and empiric antibiotic therapy should be adapted appropriately.",1471-230X (Electronic) 1471-230X (Linking),2021 Mar 30,,"['10.1186/s12876-021-01719-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12876-021-01719-3 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Antibiotic', 'Diarrhea', 'Iran', 'Quinolone resistance', 'Salmonella spp.']",,,

Clinical management of enteric fever remains a challenge with the emergence of ESBL-producing strains, especially XDR Salmonella Typhi from Sindh, Pakistan. METHODS: All strains of S. Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A isolated from cases presenting with symptoms of enteric fever in England and Wales, between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2020, were characterized using WGS. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using an agar dilution method. RESULTS: ESBL strains contributed to 69 cases of enteric fever (S. Typhi n = 68, S. Paratyphi A n = 1); 68 were imported (Pakistan n = 64, Iraq n = 2, Bangladesh n = 1 and India n = 1). Ages ranged from 1 to 56 years, 36/69 (52%) were children, 52% were female and the duration of hospital stay ranged from 1 to 23 days. The ESBL phenotype was conferred by the presence of blaCTX-M-15 (S. Typhi n = 67 and S. Paratyphi A n = 1) or blaCTX-M-55 (S. Typhi n = 1). An IncY plasmid harbouring blaCTX-M-15 and qnr was detected in 56 strains from Pakistan.

A fundamental aspect of S. Typhi pathogenesis is its ability to survive in human macrophages but not in macrophages from other animals (i.e. mice). Despite the importance of macrophages in establishing systemic S. Typhi infection, the mechanisms that macrophages use to control the growth of S. Typhi and the role of these mechanisms in the bacterium's adaptation to the human host are mostly unknown. To facilitate unbiased identification of genes involved in controlling the growth of S. Typhi in macrophages, we report optimized experimental conditions required to perform loss-of function pooled shRNA screens in primary mouse bone-marrow derived macrophages. Following infection with a fluorescent-labeled S. Typhi, infected cells are sorted based on the intensity of fluorescence (i.e. number of intracellular fluorescent bacteria). shRNAs enriched in the fluorescent population are identified by next-generation sequencing. A proof-of-concept screen targeting the mouse Rab GTPases confirmed Rab32 as important to restrict S. Typhi in mouse macrophages. Interestingly and rather unexpectedly, this screen also revealed that Rab1b controls S. Typhi growth in mouse macrophages. This constitutes the first report of a Rab GTPase other than Rab32 involved in S. Typhi host-restriction.

Herein, we proposed a magnetically assisted surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-label immunoassay for the sensitive detection of bacteria by using a universal approach based on free antibody labelling and staphylococcus proteins A (PA)-SERS tags orientation recognition. The SERS biosensor consists of two functional nanomaterials: aptamer-conjugated Fe3O4@Au magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as magnetic SERS platform for pathogen enrichment and PA modified-SERS tags (Au@DTNB@PA) as a universal probe for target bacteria quantitative detection. After target bacteria enriched, free antibody was used to specific marking target bacteria and provided numerous Fc fragment, which can guide the PA-SERS tags orientation-dependent binding. With this strategy, Fe3O4@Au/bacteria/SERS tags sandwich immunocomplexes for most bacteria (expect several species of Staphylococcus) were easy constructed. The limits of detection (LODs) of the proposed assay were found to be 10, 10, and 25 cells/mL for three common pathogens Escherichia coli (E. coli), Listeria monocytogenes (L. mono), and Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhi), respectively, in real food samples.

A set of physico-chemical and immunological tests are employed for complete vaccine characterisation and to ensure their consistency, potency, safety and stability, following the relevant World Health Organization and Pharmacopoeia guidelines. Variable requirements for analytical methods are linked to conjugate structure, carrier protein nature and size and O-acetyl content of polysaccharide.

More validation experiments are required to establish the most effective and suitable methods for glycoconjugate analysis to bring uniformity to the existing protocols, although the need for product-specific approaches will apply, especially for the more complex vaccines.

RESULTS: Salmonella was isolated in 15.80% of samples and, among the isolates, 733 were typed as Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) or its monophasic variant (MST). Over time, there was an increase of isolation of MST which outnumbered ST. Most of the strains were isolated in animals during the weaning stage and the growing - fattening period whereas the clinical cases were mainly present in young pigs after weaning. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the presence of ST and MST in pig farms although, considering the total of isolated serotypes, with lower percentages than previously reported.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) allow for the culture-free detection of bacterial pathogens and are not as labor intensive and time consuming as culture-based detection methods. However, suitable sample preparation methods must be developed for the realization of simple, rapid, and sensitive NAATs. To resolve this problem, we developed a new sample preparation method that integrates bacterial pathogen enrichment and DNA extraction. We engineered magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with a physicochemical probe (tryptamine) for single-tube sample preparation with minimal sample loss. The tryptamine-functionalized MNPs (Indole@MNPs) showed inherent hydrophobicity owing to the indole side chain and a change in their zeta potential with a decrease in the pH. Because of their physicochemical characteristics, the Indole@MNPs could adsorb bacterial pathogens, thus allowing sample enrichment and DNA binding and release through weak electrostatic interactions via pH control.

In this study, the chemical profile, antimicrobial, and mutagenic activities of the Elletaria cardamomum essential oil were investigated. GC-MS analysis identified the major bioactive components as alpha-terpinyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, linalool acetate, and sabinene, at concentrations of 34.95, 25.30, 8.13, and 5.48% respectively, of the essential oil's content. Regarding antimicrobial activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration of green cardamom essential oil was 1% against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 14213. Green cardamom essential oil, when used at concentrations of 0.015, 0.031, 0.062, and 0.125% (v/v) prevented biofilm formation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 by 64.29, 65.98, 70.41, and 85.59%, respectively. Furthermore, these concentrations inhibited 6.13, 45.50, 49.45, and 100%, respectively, of the Salmonella Typhimurium JSG 1748 biofilm. A mutagenicity assay confirmed that green cardamom essential oil has no demonstrable mutagenic activity against the tested strains. The study's findings suggest that green cardamom derived bioactive compounds are safe organic antimicrobials, effective in controlling biofilm formation by Gram-negative pathogens. Moreover, such compounds could possibly be used in the food industry (e.g., bakery, dairy, meat, and other food products) as a safe alternative to chemical preservatives (antimicrobials) to enhance shelf life by improving the antimicrobial status while at the same time imparting a pleasant and appealing aroma for consumers.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fmicb.2021.620227 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Escherichia coli O157:H7', 'GC-MS characterization', 'Salmonella Typhimurium JSG 1748', 'anti-biofilm potential', 'bioactive compounds', 'green cardamom', 'mutagenic activity']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Abdullah, Asghar, Algburi, Huang, Ahmad, Zhong, Javed, Ermakov', 'and Chikindas.']",,

EM is used to determine harborage sites of microorganisms on processing equipment, assess effectiveness of sanitation programs, and prevent transmission of foodborne pathogens. This study characterizes commercially-available polyurethane foam (PUF) and cellulose (CELL) EM tools for their efficacy in the release of foodborne pathogens from their sponge matrices. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to 1) compare the ability of EM tools to release microorganisms into a recovery eluent, 2) characterize EM tool performance at decreasing inoculum concentrations, and 3) assess the impact of various operators during the processing of EM samples. Two bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium) and one human norovirus surrogate (Tulane virus [TV]) were compared at decreasing inoculum levels utilizing two elution techniques (mechanical stomacher, manually by operator), and across six operators. Data indicated that EM tool material composition impacted the release of microorganisms (p = 0.0001), where the PUF EM tool released TV more readily than the CELL EM tool. Conversely, the decreasing inoculum levels did not statistically differ in the release of microorganisms from the EM tool matrices. In addition, no significant difference was found between the machine stomacher and manual elution by human operator or between operators. Overall, the study provides a detailed characterization of two commercially-available EM tools, and the differences identified in this study can be used to improve the effectiveness of EM programs.",1879-3460 (Electronic) 0168-1605 (Linking),2021 Apr 20,,"['S0168-1605(21)00157-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.109198 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Human norovirus environmental monitoring', 'Listeria monocytogenes', 'Release', 'Salmonella typhimurium', 'Sponge', 'Tulane virus']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Earlier work has established both a positive role for prodigiosin in ATP production during population lag phase and a negative role during high-rate, low cell density growth. This study uses the growth rate and growth phase modulation afforded by chemostat culture to extend prodigiosin functional analysis to the high density and stationary phases. Cellular levels of prodigiosin were positively associated with cellular levels of ATP during high-density growth, and artificial pigment induction during this phase increased cellular ATP. Following peak high density ATP per cell, early stationary phase enabled significant population growth while prodigiosin levels remained high and ATP declined. During late stationary phase, ATP per cell was positively associated with prodigiosin per cell while both declined during continued growth. These results provide correlational evidence for multiple effects of prodigiosin pigment on ATP production throughout the growth cycle.

Complexes 1 and 2 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against K562 cells, which undergoes a 2-fold increase on applying 5 min of irradiation with UV-A light. Complex 2 was more effective and a good correlation between cytotoxicity and intracellular concentration was observed, the intracellular copper concentration required to inhibit 50% of cell growth being 3.5 x 10(-15) mol cell(-1).",1873-3344 (Electronic) 0162-0134 (Linking),2021 Mar 13,,"['S0162-0134(21)00039-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2021.111392 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['Aluminum complexes', 'Cytotoxicity activity in cancer cells', 'Phosphatase-like activity']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

This also affects 1 in 5 people in the UK each year. Rapid diagnosis, appropriate treatment and infection control measures are, therefore, particularly important. Currently, Public Health Wales and England Microbiology Division test for five key bacterial gastrointestinal pathogens, i.e. Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC), Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Clostridioides difficile. There is, however, a poor success rate with identification of these pathogens, leaving the patient at risk from untreated infections. This study has developed effective and reliable tools with a high positive outcome for diagnosis of diarrhoeal infection. The study blindly analysed 592 samples, with the most abundant species being Shigella sonnei at 15%, and the top genus Bacteroides at 26%. Campylobacter spp. had an abundance of 4%, Clostridium difficile 3%, and Salmonella spp. 0.2%. There were also significant differences in abundance at genus level, between the Flemish Gut project and diarrhoea samples, with respect to Shigella (0.2%) and Campylobacter (0.1%). The project introduced a novel Shigella spp. (Escherichia) threshold of 5.32% to determine (Escherichia) a healthy or unhealthy community.

The Shiga toxin (Stx) encoded by a defective prophage is the key virulence factor of S. dysenteriae type 1 (SD1) strains. Here we present the full genome sequence of an SD1 strain HNCMB 20080 isolated in 1954, compare it to other sequenced SD1 genomes, and assess the diversity of Stx-prophages harbored by previously sequenced SD1 strains. The genome of HNCMB 20080 consists of a chromosome sized 4,393,622 bp containing 5,183 CDSs, as well as two small plasmids. Comparative genomic analysis revealed a high degree of uniformity among SD1 genomes, including the structure of Stx prophage regions, which we found to form two subgroups termed PT-I and PT-II. All PT-I strains are members of the sequence type (ST) 146 or ST260, while the only PT-II harboring strain, Sd1617 proved to be ST untypeable.

P. aeruginosa can acquire iron from heme via the non-redundant heme assimilation system (Has) and Pseudomonas heme uptake (Phu) systems. Heme transported by either the Has or Phu system is sequestered by the cytoplasmic protein PhuS. Furthermore, PhuS has been shown to specifically transfer heme to the iron-regulated heme oxygenase HemO. As the PhuS homolog ShuS from Shigella dysenteriae was observed to bind DNA as a function of its heme status we sought to further determine if PhuS, in addition to its role in regulating heme flux through HemO, functions as a DNA binding protein. Herein, through a combination of CHIP-PCR, EMSA and fluorescence anisotropy we show apo-PhuS but not holo-PhuS binds upstream of the tandem iron-responsive sRNAs prrF1,F2. Previous studies have shown the PrrF sRNAs are required for sparing iron for essential proteins during iron starvation. Furthermore, under certain conditions a heme-dependent read through of the prrF1 terminator yields the longer PrrH transcript. qPCR analysis of P. aeruginosa WT and DeltaphuS strains shows loss of PhuS abrogates the heme-dependent regulation of PrrF and PrrH levels. Taken together, our data shows PhuS, in addition to its role in extracellular heme metabolism, also functions as a transcriptional regulator by modulating PrrF and PrrH levels in response to heme. This dual function of PhuS is central to integrating extracellular heme utilization into the PrrF/PrrH sRNA regulatory network that is critical for P. aeruginosa adaptation and virulence within the host.",1083-351X (Electronic) 0021-9258 (Linking),2021 Jan 8,,"['S0021-9258(21)00043-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100275 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

However, cases of men who have sex with men (MSM)-associated shigellosis have been reported where Shigella of the same serotype were serially sampled from individuals between 1 and 1,862 days apart, possibly due to persistent carriage or reinfection with the same serotype. Here, we investigate the accessory genome dynamics of MSM-associated S. flexneri and S. sonnei isolates serially sampled from individual patients at various days apart to shed light on the adaptation of these important pathogens during infection. We find that pairs likely associated with persistent infection/carriage and with a smaller single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distance, demonstrated significantly less variation in accessory genome content than pairs likely associated with reinfection, and with a greater SNP distance. We observed antimicrobial resistance acquisition during Shigella carriage, including the gain of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene during carriage. Finally, we explored large chromosomal structural variations and rearrangements in seven (five chronic and two reinfection associated) pairs of S. flexneri 3a isolates from an MSM-associated epidemic sublineage, which revealed variations at several common regions across isolate pairs, mediated by insertion sequence elements and comprising a distinct predicted functional profile. This study provides insight on the variation of accessory genome dynamics and large structural genomic changes in Shigella during persistent infection/carriage. In addition, we have also created a complete reference genome and biobanked isolate of the globally important pathogen, S. flexneri 3a.IMPORTANCE Shigella spp. are Gram-negative bacteria that are the etiological agent of shigellosis, the second most common cause of diarrheal illness among children under the age of five in low-income countries. In high-income countries, shigellosis is also a sexually transmissible disease among men who have sex with men. Within the latter setting, we have captured prolonged and/or recurrent infection with shigellae of the same serotype, challenging the belief that Shigella infection is short lived and providing an early opportunity to study the evolution of the pathogen over the course of infection. Using this recently emerged transmission scenario, we comprehensively characterize the genomic changes that occur over the course of individual infection with Shigella and uncover a distinct functional profile of variable genomic regions, findings that have relevance for other Enterobacteriaceae.",2150-7511 (Electronic),2021 Apr 27,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5850-1949'],"['mBio.00254-21 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00254-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['AMR', 'MSM', 'PacBio', 'Shigella', 'UK', 'WGSA', 'genomics', 'persistent infection']",['(c) Crown copyright 2021.'],,

OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Shigella species recovered in Colombia from 1997 to 2018. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We received isolates from laboratories in 29 Colombian departments. We serotyped with specific antiserum and determined antimicrobial resistance and minimal inhibitory concentrations for ten antibiotics with Kirby-Bauer tests following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. RESULTS: We analyzed 5,251 isolates of Shigella spp., most of them obtained from stools (96.4%); 2,511 (47.8%) were from children under five years of age. The two most common species were S. sonnei (55.1%) and S. flexneri (41.7%). The highest resistance rate was that of tetracycline (88.1%) followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (79.3%) and ampicillin (65.5%); 50.8% of isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, 43.6% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and less than 1% to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin.

The results showed that supplementing 8% KGM, GG, and LBG to a HFD dramatically reduced the body weight gain and adipose accumulation, attenuated liver injury, and antagonized glycolipid metabolism and inflammation-related parameters of HFD-fed mice in different degrees. However, only LBG had such roles when the supplement dose was reduced to 2%. In addition, it was found that LBG required more time to exert its impacts on weight control and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of gut microbiota indicated that mannans with different structures and supplement doses affected the overall structure of the gut microbiota to a varying extent and specifically changed the abundance of some OTUs. Moreover, several OTUs belonging to the genera Muribaculum, Staphylococcus, [Eubacterium] fissicatena group, and Christensenella had a high correlation with obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders of the host.

Actinobacteria represent a potential source of new compounds, as these microorganisms have already produced a great diversity of clinically employed antibiotics. Endophytes from unexplored biomes, such as the Pantanal (the largest wetland in the world), can be a source of new molecules. Hymenachne amplexicaulis is among the unexplored native plants of the Pantanal in terms of its endophytic community. This plant is considered a weed in other countries due to its ability to adapt and compete with native plants, and there is evidence to suggest that the endophytic community of H. amplexicaulis plays an important role in this competitiveness. To explore its therapeutic potential, the present study isolated, identified (using partial sequence of the 16S rDNA) and bioprospected H. amplexicaulis endophytic actinobacteria. Ten isolates belonging to the genera Streptomyces, Microbispora, Leifsonia, and Verrucosispora were obtained from root fragments. The susceptibility profile of the isolates to the different classes of antibiotics was evaluated, with 80 % of the isolates showing resistance to the antibiotics Nalidixic Acid, Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, Oxacillin, and Rifampicin. To assess antibacterial and antitumor activities, methanolic extracts were obtained by fermentation in SG culture medium at 36 degrees C at 180 rpm for 10 days. The extract produced from the S. albidoflavus CMRP4854 isolate was the only one to show activity against the Gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter baumanii. Due to the great clinical importance of this pathogen and the difficulty in obtaining active compounds against it, the CMRP4854 isolate should be further investigated for the identification of active compounds and mode of action. We also emphasize the results obtained by the extract of the isolates Streptomyces albidoflavus CMRP4852 and Verrucosispora sp. CMRP4860 that presented antibacterial effect against Methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (MIC: 1.5 mug/mL and 13 mug/mL, respectively) and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) (MIC: 40 mug/mL for both extracts). Extracts (200 mug/mL) of these two endophytes also showed selective cytotoxicity action against murine B16-F10 melanoma cells. However, the CMRP4852 extract also affected the density of normal cells. Due to these results, the crude extract of isolate CMRP4860 Verrucosispora sp., which was the only one that presented cytotoxicity and reduced cell density only in tumor cells, was selected for subsequent analysis involving scale-up fermentation of the CMRP4860 resulting in 9 fractions that were tested against both bacteria and tumor cells, with particular fractions showing promise and meriting further investigation.

It is used traditionally by Filipinos to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, ulcer and wound infections. Based on previous investigations where cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) functions as immune-linked factor in infectious sensitivities to bacterial pathogens by triggering pro-inflammatory immune-associated reactions, we investigated the antimicrobial and COX inhibitory activities of the extracts and tetrahydrobisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids of P. ophthalmicus in vitro and in silico to validate its ethnomedicinal uses. Thus, the dichloromethane-methanol (DCM-MeOH) crude extract and alkaloid extracts exhibiting antibacterial activities against drug-resistant bacterial strains such as methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Klebsiella pneumoniae + CRE and Pseudomonas aeruginosa + MBL afforded (+)-tetrandrine (1) and (+)-limacusine (2) as the major biologically active tetrahydrobisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloidal constituents after purification. Both tetrahydrobisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids 1 and 2 showed broad spectrum antibacterial activity with strongest inhibition against the Gram-negative bacteria MbetaL-Pseudomonas aeruginosa Klebsiella pneumoniae + CRE. Interestingly, the alkaloid limacusine (2) showed selective inhibition against ovine COX-2 in vitro. These results were ascertained by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments where alkaloid 2 showed strong affinity in the catalytic sites of Gram-negative bacterial enzymes P. aeruginosa elastase and K. pneumoniae KPC-2 carbapenemase (enzymes involved in infectivity mechanisms), and of ovine COX-2. Overall, our study provides credence on the ethnomedicinal use of the Philippine medicinal plant P. ophthalmicus as traditional plant-based adjuvant to treat bacterial conjunctivitis and other related infections. The antibacterial activities and selective COX-2 inhibition observed for limacusine (2) point to its role as the biologically active constituent of P. ophthalmicus. A limited number of drugs with COX-2 inhibitory properties like celecoxib also confer antibacterial activity.

Single-centre interventions, however, are likely to fail in the long term, as patients are commonly transferred between institutions given the economic integration across borders. A transnational approach targeting larger regions is needed to plan overarching sets of interventions. Here, we aim to describe differences in diagnostic and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in the fight against MDROs. METHODS: In 2019, we systematically assessed diagnostic algorithms and IPC measures implemented for detection and control of MDROs at three tertiary academic care centres (Freiburg; Strasbourg; Basel). Data were collected using a standardised data collection sheet to be filled in by every centre. Uncertainties were clarified by direct contact via telephone or email with the data supplier. Internal validity was checked by at least two researchers independently filling in the survey. RESULTS: All centres have established a primarily culture-based, rather than a nucleic acid amplification-based approach for detection of MDROs (i.e., vancomycin-resistant Enterococci [VRE], methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae [ESBL], carbapenemase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negatives [CPGN/CRGN]). IPC measures differed greatly across all centres. High-risk patients are screened for most MDROs on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in all centres; only the French centre is screening all patients admitted to the ICU for VRE, MRSA and ESBL. Patients colonised/infected by MRSA, quinolone-resistant ESBL Klebsiella spp. and CPGN/CRGN are isolated everywhere, whereas patients colonised/infected by VRE and ESBL are usually not isolated in the German centre. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the French and Swiss centres, the German centre no longer uses isolation measures to control VRE and quinolone-susceptible ESBL. Overall, the French centre is more focused on intercepting MDRO transmission from outside, whereas the German and Swiss centres are more focused on intercepting endemic MDRO transmission.

Results: Of the 879 students who participated in this study (454 students which treated patients, 425 controls) a total of 50 students (5.7%) tested positive for a multi-drug resistant bacterium (MDRB); 13 (1.5%) students tested positive for MRSA, 26 (3.0%) for ESBL and 12 (1.4%) for VRE. No statistically significant differences were found between the students who treated patients compared to the control group for any of the MDRB and study centres, excluding MRSA carriage in the Italian student population. The use of antibiotics the year before sampling, was positively associated with the presence of an MDRB (OR 2.0; 95% Confidence Interval 1.10-3.68; p = 0.02). Conclusion: The risk for MDRB carriage and sequential transmission of MDRB for dental health care students and their patients were acceptably low.",2000-2297 (Print) 2000-2297 (Linking),2021 Feb 21,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4049-2914', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9964-0205']","['10.1080/20002297.2021.1889898 [doi]', '1889898 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,"['(MeSH-terms): MDR/multi-drug resistant bacteria', 'dentistry', 'extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)', 'methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)', 'public Health', 'students', 'vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE)']","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics. Here, two novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides, Lausporin-1 and Lausporin-2, were identified from the venom gland of the scorpion L. australasiae through a cDNA library screening strategy. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that Lausporin-1 and Lausporin-2 are cationic alpha-helical amphipathic molecules. Antimicrobial assays demonstrated that the two peptides possess antibacterial activities against several species of antibiotic-resistant staphylococci. Importantly, they are active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus capitis, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 10 mug/ml. Moreover, both peptides can induce dose-dependent plasma membrane disruptions of the bacteria. In short, our work expands the knowledge of the scorpion L. australasiae venom-derived AMPs and sheds light on the potential of Lausporin-1 and Lausporin-2 in the development of novel drugs against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.",1879-3150 (Electronic) 0041-0101 (Linking),2021 Jun,,"['S0041-0101(21)00106-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxicon.2021.04.002 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['Antimicrobial peptide', 'Liocheles australasiae', 'Membrane disruption', 'Methicillin-resistant staphylococci', 'Scorpion']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, the objectives of this study were to investigate the diversity in Staphylococcus spp. recovered from different anatomical locations in healthy and diseased cats and to determine the occurrence of MDR and MRS spp. as well as possible risk factors associated with colonization in these cats. Five swabs were collected from the anus, skin, ear canal, conjunctival sac, and nares of each cat (209 healthy and 191 diseased) admitted to a veterinary clinic in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia, between January and December 2018. Prior to sample collection, cat owners completed a questionnaire collecting information on cat demographics, health status, management, and antimicrobial usage. In total, 179 Staphylococcus isolates were recovered from healthy (n = 71) and diseased (n = 108) cats, including 94 (52.5%) coagulase-positive staphylococci (CoPS), and 85 (47.5%) coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Five Staphylococcus spp. were identified, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus felis, Staphylococcus capitis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Staphylococcus isolates were most commonly resistant to penicillin (56.4%) and ciprofloxacin (25.7%); however, no isolate was resistant to clindamycin. Thirty (16.8%) Staphylococcus spp. (24 S. aureus and 6 S. pseudintermedius) isolates were MDR, with resistance to up to six different antibiotic classes. Only 17 (9.5%) Staphylococcus spp. (15 methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 2 methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius) harbored the mecA gene. Risk factor analysis showed that cats with a history of antibiotic therapy, those raised mainly indoors with a child, and those who visit a veterinary clinic for treatment were at higher risk of MDR and MRS colonization. In conclusion, MDR and MRS were common in healthy and diseased cats in Saudi Arabia. Thus, an effective antimicrobial stewardship program and further studies using a One Health approach are required to investigate the role of cats as vectors for AMR transmission to humans.",2079-6382 (Print) 2079-6382 (Linking),2021 Mar 31,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8459-0666', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2533-988X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7194-5429', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2145-2714']","['antibiotics10040367 [pii]', '10.3390/antibiotics10040367 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['Staphylococcus', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'cats', 'methicillin-resistance', 'multidrug resistance', 'risk factors']",,,

M. lacticum biofilm structure was more developed compared to S. capitis, representing vastly mature biofilms with a strongly developed amorphous matrix, possibly extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), at late-stage biofilm formation. S. capitis showed faster growth behavior but still resulted in a relatively flat biofilm structure. Strong correlations were found between several roughness parameters and S. capitis surface coverage (r >/= 0.98), and between total surface free energy (gammas) and S. capitis surface coverage (r = 0.89), while M. lacticum remained mostly unaffected.

The objectives were to describe the populations of staphylococci on teatcups in milking parlours in sheep or goat farms in two field investigations throughout Greece and to potentially associate the findings with the use of anti-staphylococcal mastitis vaccinations in the farms visited during the two investigations. In a cross-sectional (255 sheep and 66 goat farms across Greece) and a longitudinal (12 sheep farms, four samplings, throughout lactation) study, swab samples were collected from 1418 teatcups (upper and lower part) for staphylococcal recovery, identification and assessment of biofilm-formation. A total of 328 contaminated teatcups (23.1%) were found in 105 sheep (41.2%) and 35 goat (53.0%) farms. Staphylococci were more frequently recovered from the upper than the lower part of teatcups: 269 versus 139 teatcups, respectively. After identification, 253 staphylococcal isolates were found: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus lentus, and Staphylococcus capitis predominated. Of these isolates, 87.4% were biofilm-forming. The proportion of contaminated teatcups was smaller in farms where vaccination against anti-staphylococcal mastitis in general or vaccination specifically against mastitis caused specifically by biofilm-forming staphylococcal strains was applied, 19.7% or 10.9%, respectively, versus 25.5% in farms without vaccination. In the longitudinal study, contaminated teatcups were identified in 28 (58.3%) sampling occasions, with staphylococci being recovered more frequently from their upper part. The same species as in the cross-sectional study predominated. Of these isolates, 61.9% were biofilm-forming. In farms where vaccination against mastitis caused specifically by biofilm-forming staphylococcal strains was applied, the proportion of contaminated teatcups was smaller: 20.4% versus 48.3% in farms without vaccination. There were no differences in proportions of contaminated teatcups between sampling occasions. In conclusion, the great majority of staphylococci recovered from teatcups of milking parlours in sheep and goat farms included biofilm-forming isolates. Reduced staphylococcal isolation was noted in farms where anti-staphylococcal vaccination was performed; this was possibly the effect of reduced excretion of staphylococci in the milk of vaccinated animals.",2076-0817 (Print) 2076-0817 (Linking),2021 Mar 24,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2819-2089', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9533-0093', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9229-3151']","['pathogens10040385 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens10040385 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['biofilm', 'goat', 'mastitis', 'milking parlour', 'sheep', 'staphylococcus', 'teatcup', 'vaccination']",,,

We identify a 6-TG biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chromogenes and other coagulase-negative staphylococci including S. epidermidis, S. pseudintermedius and S. capitis. Recombinant S. aureus strains harbouring this operon produce 6-TG and, when used in subcutaneous co-infections in mice with virulent S. aureus USA300, protect the host from necrotic lesion formation. Used prophylactically, 6-TG reduces necrotic skin lesions in mice infected with USA300, and this effect is mediated by abrogation of toxin production.

The dried microorganisms were either exposed to full UV-VIS radiation (UV dose = 1148 kJ m(-2)) or were shielded from radiation. After the 5-h stratospheric exposure, samples were assayed for survival and metabolic changes. Spores from the fungus A. niger and cells from the Gram-(-) bacterium S. shabanensis were the most resistant with a 2- and 4-log reduction, respectively. Exposed Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 was completely inactivated (both with and without UV exposure) and S. capitis subsp. capitis only survived the UV shielded experimental condition (3-log reduction).

In this study, we investigated the role of the bacteria belonging to the Staphylococcus genus using targeted sequencing of the tuf gene with genus-specific primers. We compared staphylococcal communities on lesional and non-lesional skin of AD patients, as well as AD patients with healthy controls, and determined the absolute abundance of bacteria present at each site. We observed that the staphylococcal community, bacterial alpha diversity, and bacterial densities were similar on lesional and non-lesional skin, whereas AD severity was associated with significant changes in staphylococcal composition. Increased S. aureus, Staphylococcus capitis, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis abundances were correlated with increased severity. Conversely, Staphylococcus hominis abundance was negatively correlated with severity. Furthermore, S. hominis relative abundance was reduced on AD skin compared to healthy skin.

The surface sterilized head lice pools were subjected to genomic DNA extraction while next generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Six female and three male head lice identified as Pediculus humanus capitis were collected.

The 16S rRNA genome sequencing revealed a number of rare and pathogenic bacterial species within the head lice of the Orang Asli. The socio-economic practices of the community which involved forest foraging and hunting, and their poor living conditions potentially facilitated the transmission of zoonotic bacterial pathogens, including those found within the head lice.

Fifty-one laboratories were asked to report: (i) AST system used; (ii) antimicrobial MICs; (iii) breakpoints used (CLSI or EUCAST); and (iv) clinical category. Minor, major and very major errors (mEs, MEs and VMEs, respectively) were determined. RESULTS: The greatest MIC discrepancies found were: (i) by AST method: 19.4% (gradient diffusion); (ii) by antimicrobial agent: daptomycin (21.3%) and oxacillin (20.6%); and (iii) by isolate: CC-07/cfr (48.0%). The greatest error rates were: (i) by AST method: gradient diffusion (4.3% and 5.1% VMEs, using EUCAST and CLSI, respectively); (ii) by breakpoint: 3.8% EUCAST and 2.3% CLSI; (iii) by error type: mEs (0.8% EUCAST and 1.0% CLSI), MEs (1.8% EUCAST and 0.7% CLSI) and VMEs (1.2% EUCAST and 0.6% CLSI); (iii) by antimicrobial agent: VMEs (4.7% linezolid and 4.3% oxacillin using EUCAST); MEs (14.3% fosfomycin, 9.1% tobramycin and 5.7% gentamicin using EUCAST); and mEs (22.6% amikacin using EUCAST).

Currently, scientific data related to the management of PSI is limited, and the optimal strategy and related clinical outcome remains unclear. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the management of periprosthetic joint infection are mainly based on data from patients after hip and knee arthroplasty. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether these guidelines are also valid for patients with PSI after RSA. In addition, the functional outcome according to the surgical intervention was assessed. METHODS: An RSA database was retrospectively reviewed to identify infections after primary and revised RSAs, diagnosed between 2004 and 2018. Data collected included age, sex, indication for RSA, causative pathogen, surgical and antimicrobial treatment, functional outcome and recurrence. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with a PSI were identified. Surgical treatment was subdivided into: debridement and implant retention (DAIR) (n=6; 17%); 1-stage revision (n=1; 3%); 2-stage revision (n=16; 44%); multiple stage revisions (> 2 stages) (n=7; 19%); definitive spacer (n=2; 6%) and resection arthroplasty (n=4; 11%). The most common causative pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=11; 31%) and Cutibacterium acnes (n=9; 25%). Four patients (11%) were diagnosed with recurrence, all of them were initially treated with a DAIR approach. The median follow-up was 36 months (range 24-132 months). CONCLUSION: PSI is typically caused by low-virulent pathogens, which often are diagnosed with a delay resulting in chronic infection at time of surgery. Our results indicate that treating patients with chronic PSI with DAIR has a high recurrence rate. In addition, implant exchange (i.e. 1- and 2-stage) does not compromise the functional result as compared to implant retention. Thus, patients with chronic PSI should be treated with implant exchange. Future research should further clarify which surgical strategy (i.e. 1 versus 2-stage exchange) has a better outcome overall.",1532-6500 (Electronic) 1058-2746 (Linking),2021 Apr 22,,"['S1058-2746(21)00394-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jse.2021.04.014 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['Cutibacterium acnes', 'Functional outcome', 'Periprosthetic joint infection', 'Periprosthetic shoulder infection', 'Reverse shoulder arthroplasty', 'Surgical treatment']",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Thirty Non-epidermidis CoNS isolates were obtained from poultry, sheep, goat, pig, and dairy cow nostrils. Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) activity was assayed in bacteria-free supernatants from non-epidermidis CoNS against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV). In 13 of the 30 strains (43.3 %), bacteria-free supernatants showed HI activity for NDV and BPIV-3. Staphylococcus xylosus supernatants from poultry (one isolate), sheep (two isolates), goat (one isolate), and dairy cow (three isolates) had the highest frequency of HI activity on NDV and BPIV-3, followed by Staphylococcus sp. supernatants from goat (one isolate), dairy cow (two isolates), and finally Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus chromogens and Staphylococcus gallinarum supernatants with single isolation from poultry, pig and poultry, respectively. Nine isolates had the homologous gene to the embp gene of S. epidermidis, and it was associated with HI activity in the studied viruses. By Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, S. xylosus isolates showed to be different clones and related to the origin of isolation and HI activity.

The skin microbiota is in constant contact with the surrounding environment which can alter its eubiotic state. Recently it has been also observed that the application of cosmetic products can alter the balance of the skin microbiota. This effect may be attributed to many factors including the residual activity of the preservatives on the skin. In the present work, we studied the effect of eleven preservatives commonly found in cosmetic products on Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro using 3D skin models and culture-dependent methods. Also, the effect on Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has been investigated. Among tested combinations, three resulted as the best suitable for restoring a pre-existing dysbiosis since they act moderately inhibiting C. acnes and strongly S. aureus without simultaneously inhibiting the growth of S. epidermidis. The other four combinations resulted as the best suitable for use in topical products for skin and scalp in which it is necessary to preserve the eubiosis of the microbiota. Some of the tested were also able to increase HDAC3 expression. Taking together these data highlight the role of preservatives of skin resident microflora dynamics and could provide a reference for correctly choice preservatives and dosage in cosmetic formulations to preserve or restore homeostasis of skin microbiota.",2045-2322 (Electronic) 2045-2322 (Linking),2021 Apr 22,,"['10.1038/s41598-021-88072-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-021-88072-3 [pii]']",['eng'],England,,,,

Design: Before and after trial. Setting: Public hospital, tertiary referral center. Participants: All existing biometric identification devices in the hospital (n = 20). Methods: Collection of 2 microbiological samples from the fingerprint reading surface of biometric devices immediately before and after applying the solution with alcohol 70% and in separate time periods with isopropyl alcohol chlorhexidine. Results: It have been identified 21 different bacterial species in a total of 78 samples, mostly Staphylococcus epidermidis (32 samples) and S aureus (7 samples). S epidermidis was eliminated in 61.5% of the samples after disinfecting with alcohol 70% and in 92.3% of the samples disinfected with isopropyl alcohol chlorhexidine. S aureus was eliminated in 33.3% and 100% of the samples, respectively. We found no bacterial growth in 10% of the devices after disinfection with 70% alcohol and in 78.9% of devices after disinfection with isopropyl alcohol chlorhexidine.

At least 65% of all infectious diseases are associated with biofilm-forming bacteria. As Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are among the most common agents of hospital infections and the infections are mostly biofilm-related, they pose an important problem. In infectious isolates, the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEK) values of biofilm forms are much higher than the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values of planktonic forms. This situation requires the use of much higher doses of antibiotics in the treatment of infections and causes an increase in antibiotic resistance. The N-acetylcysteine (NAC) molecule is known to be effective against biofilm by disrupting mature biofilms and reducing the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces. In this study, it was aimed to demonstrate i) the biofilm-forming abilities ii) the change in ampicillin and vancomycin MIC values in the presence of NAC molecules, iii) the change in the MBEK values of these antibiotics in the presence of NAC molecule and iv) the change in the expression levels of genes thought to be related to biofilm formation in the presence of the NAC molecule among S.aureus (n= 38) and S.epidermidis (n= 12) isolates isolated from various clinical specimens in Trakya University Health Research and Application Center. In this study, microplate crystal violet method was used to demonstrate the biofilm formation in staphylococci. Broth microdilution and checkerboard method were used to demonstrate the change in the presence of NAC molecule of the MIC and MBEC values of ampicillin and vancomycin. The effect of NAC on the expression of intercellular binding proteins A and D (icaA, icaD) and Staphylococcus regulatory protein A (sarA) genes, which are the genes involved in biofilm formation in staphylococci, was determined by quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRt-PCR) method. The Student-t test was used to compare the control and experimental groups (concentrations detected with synergy and additive effect); p< 0.05 was accepted as the limit value of significance. In this study, when the NAC molecule was used together with ampicillin and vancomycin, it was determined that this combination lowers the MIC values of staphylococcus isolates and staphylococcal biofilm MBEK values; and also the expression levels of icaA, icaD and sarA which were effective in biofilm formation in staphylococci have not changed and decreased. As a result, in this study, it has been determined that the NAC molecule can be a new alternative for combined drug therapy and is promising in terms of bringing a new approach to treatment. In addition, it is thought that it is possible to use the NAC molecule together with different microorganisms and antimicrobial agents, and the results obtained in this study are considered to be guiding for further studies on this subject.",0374-9096 (Print) 0374-9096 (Linking),2021 Apr,,['10.5578/mb.20219902 [doi]'],['tur'],Turkey,,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']","['*Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Biofilms', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', '*Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy', 'Staphylococcus/genetics', 'Vancomycin/pharmacology']"

AIM: To develop more effective clinical strategies and techniques for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections in burn patients. METHODS: Clinical samples with positive bacteria were collected from patients at the burn ward in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital in China between January 2006 and December 2019. The samples were retrospectively analyzed, the distribution of pathogenic bacteria was determined, and the trends and changes in bacterial drug resistance during different period were assessed. Drug resistance in several main pathogenic bacteria from 2006 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2019 was comparatively summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: Samples from 17119 patients were collected and analyzed from 2006 to 2019. Surprisingly, a total of 7960 strains of different pathogenic bacteria were isolated at this hospital. Among these bacteria, 87.98% (7003/7960) of the strains were isolated from burn wounds, and only 1.34% (107/7960) were isolated from the blood of patients. In addition, 49.70% (3956/7960) were identified as Gram-positive bacteria, 48.13% (3831/7960) were Gram-negative bacteria, and the remaining 2.17% (173/7960) were classified as fungi or other pathogens. Importantly, Staphylococcus aureus (21.68%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.23%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.61%) were the top three pathogens most frequently isolated from patients. CONCLUSION: In patients treated at the burn ward in this hospital from 2006 to 2019, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the predominant clinical pathogens responsible for bacterial infections. The circumstantial detection and detailed monitoring of the intensity and growth of different pathogenic bacteria in clinical patients as well as tests of drug sensitivity during burn recovery are particularly important to provide guidelines for the application of antibiotics and other related drugs. Careful collection and correct, standard culture of bacterial specimens are also crucial to improve the efficiency of bacterial infection detection.

This study aimed to evaluate postoperative function and clarify the risk factors associated with postoperative wound infection in patients receiving the open reduction and internal fixation for ankle fracture through a multicenter study. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Among 1421 patients diagnosed as having closed ankle fracture and who were treated by surgical therapy in 11 institutions from 2014 through 2019, 1201 patients (men, n = 512, women, n = 689; the mean (SD) age, 50.9 (15.6) years; the mean body mass index [BMI] (SD), 24.3 (4.2) kg/m2) were included as subjects. Excluded were 220 patients due to self-termination of treatment, inability to follow up after discharge, open fracture, distal tibia shaft fracture, and pilon fracture. We extracted the following as risk factors of wound infection: age, sex, BMI, fracture type, injury energy and histories of smoking, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, heart failure and myocardial infarction. We conducted logistic regression analysis to investigate the risk factors of wound infection using these extracted items as explanatory variables and the presence or absence of wound infection as the response variable. RESULTS: Wound infection occurred after surgery for closed ankle fracture in 69 the 1201 patients (5.7%). The causative organism was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in 15 patients, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in 4 patients, Finegoldia magna in one patient, and S. haemolyticus in one patient. In the other patients, causative organisms were not detected, culture of the causative organisms was not conducted, or they were unknown. The univariate analysis showed significant differences in sex (p = 0.01) and for smoking (p = 0.002), fracture type (p = 0.02) and heart failure (p = 0.042). Logistic regression analysis showed that smoking and type of fracture (trimalleolar fracture) were significant explanatory factors for infection (odds ratio 1.83 and 1.98, p = 0 .040 and 0.042, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: At 5.7%, the rate of postoperative wound infection in closed ankle fracture was not low. Staphylococcus was the most frequent causative organism.

Two isolates carrying linezolid resistance genes were recovered from laryngological patients and characterized by determining their antimicrobial resistance patterns and using molecular methods such as spa typing, MLST, SCCmec typing, detection of virulence genes and ica operon expression, and analysis of antimicrobial resistance determinants. Both isolates were multidrug resistant, including resistance to methicillin. The S. aureus strain was identified as ST-398/t4474/SCCmec IVe, harboring adhesin, hemolysin genes, and the ica operon. The S. haemolyticus strain was identified as ST-42/mecA-positive and harbored hemolysin genes. Linezolid resistance in S. aureus strain was associated with the mutations in the ribosomal proteins L3 and L4, and in S. haemolyticus, resistance was associated with the presence of cfr gene. Moreover, S. aureus strain harbored optrA and poxtA genes. We identified the first case of staphylococci carrying linezolid resistance genes from patients with chronic sinusitis in Poland.

However, microbiological diagnosis of PJIs remains a challenge notably because bacteria are embedded in biofilm adhered to the prosthetic material. Recently, dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment of prosthesis has been proposed as a new strategy to release bacteria from biofilm and to improve the yield of microbiological diagnosis. In this study, we evaluated the interest of a commercial device using DTT, the MicroDTTect system (Heraeus, Hanau, Germany), for the diagnosis of low-grade chronic PJIs, compared to the conventional culture of periprosthetic tissue (PPT) samples. Methods: Twenty patients undergoing a surgery procedure for removal of prosthetic material because of a suspicion of low-grade PJI without pre-operative microbiological documentation were included (NCT04371068). Bacteriological results using the fluid obtained after prosthesis treatment with the MicroDTTect system were compared to results obtained with conventional culture of PPT samples. Results: All the bacteria considered as responsible for PJIs recovered from culture of PPT samples were also detected using the MicroDTTect device. For one patient, an additional bacterial isolate (Staphylococcus haemolyticus) suspected to be involved in a polymicrobial PJI was identified using DTT treatment. Time to positivity of the cultures was also reduced using the MicroDTTect system, notably in case of Cutibacterium acnes infection. However, probable bacterial contaminants were found (MicroDTTect system, n = 5; PPT samples, n = 1).

Farms were selected based on the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) during previous diagnostic investigations. Bacterial culture of presumptive MR-NAS was based on a 2-step enrichment method that has been recommended for MRSA detection. Quarter milk samples (QMS), bulk tank milk, swab samples from young stock, and environmental samples were collected for bacterial culture. Methicillin-resistant NAS were detected on all study farms. The MR-NAS positive test rate was 3.3% (77/2,347) in QMS, 42.1% (8/19) in bulk tank milk, 29.1% (59/203) in nasal swabs from milk-fed calves, 18.3% (35/191) in postweaning calves, and 7.3% (14/191) in nasal swabs from prefresh heifers. In the environment, MR-NAS were detected in dust samples on 25% (5/20) of the dairy farms as well as in teat liners and suckers from automatic calf feeders. The geometric mean somatic cell count in QMS affected by MR-NAS (183,000 cells/mL) was slightly higher compared with all QMS (114,000 cells/mL). Nine MR-NAS species were identified; Staph. sciuri, Staph. lentus, Staph. fleurettii, Staph. epidermidis, and Staph. haemolyticus were the most common species.

We report on clinical multidrug-resistant CoNS from the uMgungundlovu District, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, as emerging pathogens. One hundred and thirty presumptive CoNS were obtained from blood cultures. Culture, biochemical tests, and the Staphaurex Latex Agglutination Test were used for the initial identification of CoNS isolates; confirmation and speciation were undertaken by the VITEK 2 system. Susceptibilities of isolates against a panel of 20 antibiotics were determined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, and the multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) indices of the isolates were determined. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the mecA gene to confirm methicillin resistance. Overall, 89/130 presumptive CoNS isolates were confirmed as CoNS by the VITEK 2 system. Of these, 68 (76.4%) isolates were putatively methicillin-resistant by the phenotypic cefoxitin screen test and 63 (92.6%) were mecA positive. Staphylococcus epidermidis (19.1%), S. hominis ssp. hominis (15.7%), and S. haemolyticus (16.9%) were the most common CoNS species. Isolates showed high percentage resistance against penicillin (100.0%), erythromycin (74.2%), and azithromycin (74.2%) while displaying high susceptibilities to linezolid (95.5%), gentamicin (95.5%), and tigecycline (94.4%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed in 76.4% of isolates. MAR index calculation revealed 71.9% of isolates with MAR index >0.2 and 20.2% >0.5. Isolates with the highest MAR indices (0.7 and 0.8) were recovered from the neonatal intensive care unit. Fifty-one MDR antibiograms were observed.

It is important to explore the antibiotics susceptibility of the bacterial agents to improve the empirical antibacterial prescription because of emerging of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective observational study including 322 patients with UTI at the largest hospital at the center of Al-Basrah Governorate in the far south of Iraq from August 2018 to November 2019. Bacterial isolates from urine samples with significant bacteria were investigated by automated VITEK(R) 2 compact system to determine the causative bacteria and their antibiotics susceptibility. Results: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the first and second most frequent Gram-negative isolates, whereas Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were the first and second most frequent Gram-positive isolates. Fosfomycin, tigecycline, colistin, meropenem, imipenem, amikacin and nitrofurantoin had high susceptibility rates against Gram-negative isolates. Nitrofurantoin, tigecycline, daptomycin, teicoplanin, vancomycin and linezolid had a high effect against Gram-positive isolates.

Here we investigated the presence of methicillin-resistant and susceptible staphylococci in both colony-born and wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus). Through selective isolation, PCR, MALDI-TOF, and whole-genome sequencing, methicillin-resistant and susceptible Staphylococcus spp. isolated from vervet monkeys were characterized. We obtained putatively methicillin-resistant staphylococci from 29 of the 34 nasal samples collected. Strains were identified by MALDI-TOF analysis. Staphylococcus cohnii (n = 15) was the most commonly isolated species, while nine other species were isolated one or two times. PCR analysis indicated that eight [28%] strains were mecA positive. The whole-genome sequencing [WGS] included eight methicillin-resistant strains (S. epidermidis (n = 2), S. cohnii (n = 3), S. arlettae (n = 2) and S. hominis (n = 1)), nine additional S. cohnii strains and two strains that could not be identified by MALDI-TOF, but genetically characterized as one S. cohnii and one S. warneri. Different resistance genes carried by different mobile genetic elements, mainly blaZ (n = 10) and tet(K) (n = 5) were found, while msr(A), cat, fosB, dfrG, erm(C), mph(C) and str were identified in one to three strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the S. cohnii strains based on SNPs indicated four clusters associated with colony born or wild. In addition, one singleton S. cohnii isolated did not form a separate group and clustered within other S. cohnii strains submitted to the NCBI.

Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of 49 eyes clinically diagnosed with infectious endophthalmitis between January 2009 and December 2018 was done. The subjects were recruited from a single tertiary referral center on Jeju Island. The baseline characteristics of all subjects were investigated, and a culture examination was performed. The isolated pathogens were analyzed to determine how their microbiological features differed from those in regions with different geographical conditions. Results: Of the 49 eyes, causative microorganisms were identified in 27 eyes (55.1%). Bacteria were found in 24 cases and fungi in 3 cases. Among the exogenous causes, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. hominis) were the most common pathogens (7 cases). Achromobacter xylosoxidans was the second most common causative pathogen (4 cases) followed by Moraxella species (3 cases). The most frequent endogenous origin was due to Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 cases). The subjects were divided into two groups according to the treatment results and analyzed for predisposing factors related to visual outcomes. The presence of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.038) and initial visual acuity (P </= 0.001) were significant predisposing factors for visual outcomes. Conclusion: The causative microorganisms of endogenous endophthalmitis on Jeju Island were not different from those reported previously. However, isolated exogenous microorganisms were different from those reported in other studies from inland areas. A high incidence and atypical clinical features of Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Moraxella in exogenous endophthalmitis were observed, reflective of the distinct climatic features of Jeju Island: high humidity and temperature.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the cefoxitin disk diffusion (CDD), oxacillin agar dilution (OAD), and mecA PCR for detecting oxacillin-resistant S. lugdunensis (ORSL) isolates. METHODS: Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was performed to determine the clonality of 117 S. lugdunensis isolates isolated between May 2009 and Jul 2014. CDD, OAD, and mecA PCR were used to identify oxacillin-resistant S. lugdunensis (ORSL). RESULTS: MLST results showed that the most common sequence type (ST) of our S. lugdunensis isolates was ST6 (35.9%) followed by ST3 (28.2%), ST27 (17.9%), and ST4 (6.8%). CDD and OAD showed that 39 and 43 isolates were ORSL, respectively. 4 ST3 CDD-susceptible S. lugdunensis (OSSL) isolates had MIC values >/= 4 for oxacillin. mecA PCR results showed that 43 OAD-resistant S. lugdunensis and 3 OAD-susceptible ST27 S. lugdunensis had the mecA gene. Therefore, OAD was used as the gold standard to evaluate the performance of CDD and mecA PCR for identifying ORSL.

Preliminary results of 24 cases in a French Reference Center for Complex Bone and Joint Infection (CRIOAC).,"BACKGROUND: While joint aspiration is the benchmark for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infections (PJI), the results can be flawed because certain bacteria are difficult to culture, the patient is on concurrent antibiotic therapy or in some cases, repeated joint aspirations confer conflicting results. The BJI InoPlex (Diaxonhit) is a multiplex ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) that measures the immune response (presence of specific IgG) to certain bacterial species from three families: Staphylococcus (8 antigens) epidermidis, aureus and lugdunensis, Streptococcus B (4 antigens) and Cutibacterium acnes (4 antigens). This assay is done with peripherally collected blood. However, there are few published studies about this assay, especially if the microbiological diagnosis is in doubt in cases of suspected chronic PJI. This led us to conduct a retrospective study in a French tertiary care center to determine 1) the sensitivity and specificity of the BJI InoPlex, 2) its positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and 3) what causes diagnostic errors. HYPOTHESIS: The BJI InoPlex has a sensitivity/specificity and PPV/NPV above 75%. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The BJI InoPlex was used 24 times on 24 patients between January 2016 and January 2017 in scenarios where the microbiological diagnosis was difficult: 1 with on-going antibiotic therapy, 13 conflicting repeat joint aspirations, 10 negative cultures with history of infection and/or clinical evidence of a PJI. The series consisted of 11 hip arthroplasty and 13 knee arthroplasty cases. The results of the BJI InoPlex test were compared to the MusculoSkeletal Infection Society (MSIS) the criteria for a joint infection. RESULTS: For the bacterial species covered by the test, the sensitivity of the BJI InoPlex for diagnosing a chronic PJI based on the 2018 MSIS criteria was 50%, the specificity was 56%, the PPV was 36% and the NPV was 69%. DISCUSSION: While innovative, minimally invasive, and rapid (results in a few hours), the BJI InoPlex does not provide an effective diagnosis of chronic PJI in complex microbiological situations. In this study, we used the test in the most difficult situations possible and on a small number of patients, which may explain why the results were not as good as in other studies. Its current performance and cost mean there is no role for it in our algorithm for treating patients with a suspected PJI, contrary to other biomarkers. Its spectrum must include other bacterial strains involved in chronic PJI. Knowledge of the specific infectious agent increases its diagnostic value, it could be used to monitor the outcome of a PJI, although other studies would be needed to support this use.

Whether these fluid collections and also suture material used during the arthroscopic surgical processes show bacterial contamination over time during surgery remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine this contamination rate and to analyze its possible influence on postoperative infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 155 patients were included. Fifty-eight underwent reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), 63 meniscal surgery and 34 patients combined ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair. We collected pooled samples of irrigation fluid from the reservoir on the sterile drape every 15 min during the surgery. In addition, we evaluated suture material of ACL graft and meniscus repair for bacterial contamination. Samples were sent for microbiological analysis, incubation time was 14 days. All patients were seen in the outpatient department 6, 12 weeks and 12 months postoperatively and examined for clinical signs of infection. RESULTS: A strong statistical correlation (R(2) = 0.81, p = 0.015) was found between an advanced duration of surgery and the number of positive microbiological findings in the accumulated fluid. Suture and fixation material showed a contamination rate of 28.4% (29 cases).

METHODS: In a retrospective chart review 76 cases of inflamed EIC that were mild (lacking systemic symptoms) were analyzed who presented to the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai between 2016&ndash;2019. RESULTS: Of cultures taken from inflamed cysts, 47% resulted in no bacterial growth or growth of normal flora, 38.4% resulted in growth of aerobic bacteria with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (8%), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (5%), and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (13%) predominating, and 9.3% resulting in growth of anaerobic bacteria with Finegoldia magna, Peptostreptococcus, and Cutibacterium acnes presenting.

CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of cases of mild inflamed EIC (lacking systemic symptoms) cultured will not grow pathogenic bacteria, therefore incision and drainage with culture and appropriate therapy is a viable therapeutic option in uncomplicated inflamed EIC lesions. In this way, over prescription of antibiotics can be minimized.

Isolates were tested phenotypically with a disc diffusion method and genotypically by PCR, for resistance to 11 antimicrobial agents including cationic antiseptic agents. Among the ovine isolates, Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 57), S. chromogenes (n = 29), S. haemolyticus (n = 17), S. simulans (n = 8) and S. caprae (n = 6) were the most prevalent species, while among human isolates, S. haemolyticus (n = 28) and S. epidermidis (n = 26) were predominant, followed by S. lugdunensis and S. hominis (n = 4). Of the 125 ovine isolates, 79 (63.2%) did not carry any of the resistance genes tested, while the remainder carried resistance genes for at least one antibiotic. The highest resistance rates among ovine isolates were recorded against tetracycline (20.8%), and penicillin (15.2%); none was resistant to methicillin and two exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR); one of which was positive for the antiseptic resistance smr gene. By contrast, most human isolates (59/70, 84.3%) were resistant to 1 antimicrobials, and 41 (58.6%) were MDR. All 52 (74.3%) penicillin-resistant isolates possessed the blaZ gene, and 33 of 70 (47.1%) harboured the mec gene; of these, seven were characterised by the Staphylococcal Chromosomal Cassette (SCCmec) type IV, 6 the type V, 5 of type III and one representative each of type I and type II.

However, there is paucity of data on the use of live lactobacilli to control axillary malodor. The objective of this study was to determine whether application of topical oil-based cream containing live Lactobacilli could decrease malodor-producing bacteria in the axilla of healthy subjects. AIMS: To determine the effects of topical cream with live lactobacilli on malodor-producing bacteria in the axilla of healthy subjects. PATIENTS/METHODS: Twenty-five adult volunteers comprising 12 males and 13 females provided informed consent. Axillary skin swabs were collected before and after 14 days application of topical cream containing live Lactobacillus pentosus KCA1. Bacterial DNA was extracted, and V4 region of the 16S rRNA was amplified and sequenced in a pair-end configuration on the Illumina MiSeq platform rendering 2 x 150 bp sequences. Microbial taxonomy to species level was generated using the Greengenes database. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) was used to identify biologically and statistically significant differences in relative abundance. RESULTS: Actinobacteria decreased from 70% to 24%, and Firmicutes increased from 26.6% to 73.9% among the female participants. In males, Actinobacteria decreased from 65% to 38%, while Firmicutes increased from 24% to 57%. Corynebacterium decreased from 62.91% to 36.63%, while Lactobacillus increased from 0.06% to 23.11%. In males, unliked females, there were reduction of Staphylococcus species associated with malodor, notably Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus hemolyticus, and Staphylococcus lugdunensis. Bacterial functional gene- Pyridoxal protein dependent enzymes involved in biotransformation of malodor precursor to volatile thioalcohols were down-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: Application of Lactobacillus pentosus KCA1 cream led to a significant decrease in the relative abundance of odor-producing Corynebacterium species in both female and male subjects.

METHODS: We enrolled female patients at least 16 years of age diagnosed with AUC in 2018. Patient information including age, menopausal status, and results of bacteriological examination were collected and analyzed regardless of bacterial identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection method. RESULTS: A total of 847 eligible cases were collected. Escherichia coli (E. coli) was the most frequently isolated bacterial species at about 70%, with proportions of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (QREC) and ESBL-producing E. coli isolates at 15.6% and 9.5% of all E. coli isolates, respectively. The proportion of Staphylococcus saprophyticus (S. saprophyticus) was significantly higher in premenopausal women. Regarding the drug susceptibility of E. coli, isolates from Eastern Japan had significantly higher susceptibility to cefazolin, cefotiam and cefpodoxime and lower susceptibility to levofloxacin in postmenopausal women. ESBL-producing E. coli isolates had a high susceptibility to tazobactam-piperacillin, cefmetazole, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fosfomycin. In S. saprophyticus, the susceptibility to beta-lactams including carbapenems was 40-60%. CONCLUSIONS: The proportions of QREC and ESBL-producing E. coli were increasing trends and lower susceptibility to LVFX in postmenopausal women was observed.

This study assessed the capacity of an isolated soil microbial consortium (OMC) to biodegrade PAHs. OMC was able to reach 100% biodegradation of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene and phenanthrene in solution, and up to 76% and 50% of anthracene and fluoranthene, respectively, from a mix of 16 PAHs. To measure phenanthrene (PHE) mineralization, OMC and eight strains isolated from OMC were used and identified by PCR amplification of the gene 16S ribosomal RNA. A novel Stenotrophomonas maltophilia CPHE1, not previously described as a PAH degrader, was able to mineralize almost 40% PHE and biodegrade 90.5% in solution, in comparison to OMC that reached 100% PHE degradation, but only 18.8% mineralization. Based on metabolites identified during PHE degradation and on the detection of two genes (PAH RHDalpha and nahAc) in OMC consortium, two possible via were described for its degradation, through salicylic and phthalic acid. PAH RHDalpha, which codified the first step on PHE biodegradation pathway, was also found in the DNA of S. maltophilia CPHE1.

Bacterial dipeptidyl peptidases 7 and 11 (DPP7s and DPP11s), belonging to the family-S46 peptidases, are important enzymes for bacterial growth and are not present in mammals. Therefore, specific inhibitors for these peptidases are promising as potential antibiotics. While the molecular mechanisms underlining strict specificity at the S1 subsite of S46 peptidases have been well studied, those of relatively broad preference at the S2 subsite of these peptidases are unknown. In this study, we performed structural and biochemical analyses on DPP7 from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SmDPP7). SmDPP7 showed preference for the accommodation of hydrophobic amino acids at the S2 subsite in general, but as an exception, also for asparagine, a hydrophilic amino acid. Structural analyses of SmDPP7 revealed that this exceptional preference to asparagine is caused by a hydrogen bonding network at the bottom of the S2 subsite. The residues in the S2 subsite are well conserved among S46 peptidases as compared with those in the S1 subsite.

The ectoparasitic Varroa destructor mite put threats on the honey bee industry. A Varroa toxic protein (VTP) from the saliva of Varroa mites contributes to the toxicity toward Apis cerana and the deformed wing virus elevation in Apis mellifera. However, the immune response and hemolymph microbiota of honey bee species after the injection of recombinant VTP has not yet been reported. In this study, both A. cerana and A. mellifera worker larvae were injected with the recombinant VTP. Then the expressions of the honey bee immune genes abaecin, defensin, and domeless at three time points were determined by qRT-PCR, and hemolymph microbial community were analyzed by culture-dependent method, after recombinant VTP injection. The mortality rates of A. cerana larvae were much higher than those of A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. VTP injection induced the upregulation of defensin gene expression in A. mellifera larvae, and higher levels of abaecin and domeless mRNAs response in A. cerana larvae, compared with the control (without any injection). Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injection also upregulated the expression levels of abaecin, defensin, and domeless in A. mellifera and A. cerana larvae. Three bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus cohnii, and Bacillus cereus) were isolated from the hemolymph of A. cerana larvae after VTP injection and at 48 h after PBS injections. Two bacterial species (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. No bacterial colonies were detected from the larval hemolymph of both honey bee species treated by injection only and the control. The result indicates that abaecin, defensin, and domeless genes and hemolymph microbiota respond to the VTP challenge.

Isolates from oral cavity were identified by microbiological and molecular methods. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were determined by Broth microdilution method. The anti-biofilm activity of essential oils and extracts investigated and as a mixture by Broth dilution method. Toxicity of the herbal mixture was assayed by in Wistar rats treated with intradermal injection. Wound healing properties of the herbal mixture against infected wounds on the back of the rats were investigated. Anti-biofilm activity was investigated on tooth surfaces. Bacterial structure changes and fine- structure study were performed by light microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy.

AIM: The aim of the study was to examine the effect of combined inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle strength training (RMST) on respiratory and swallow function in two critical care patients with marked deconditioning after massive tissue loss. METHODS: Case 1 was a 19-year-old male patient with 80% body surface area burns; case 2 was a 45-year-old man with group A streptococcus myositis necessitating quadruple amputation. Both required prolonged intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Both received routine intensive pulmonary and swallow rehabilitation before the trial; however, chronic aspiration and poor secretion clearance remained. At 25 and 26 weeks after initial injury, RMST was performed using EMST150 (expiratory) and Threshold IMT (inspiratory) devices, respectively. At baseline and throughout treatment, data collected included peak expiratory flow (PEF), anthropometry measures, aspiration risk (Penetration-Aspiration Scale [PAS]), pharyngeal clearance (Yale Pharyngeal Residue Scale), secretions (New Zealand Secretion Scale [NZSS]), and functional diet (Functional Oral Intake Scale [FOIS]) via endoscopy. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: At baseline, the PEF score of case 1 was 41% (predicted age-height norm) and the PEF score of case 2 was 14%, indicating severe expiratory compromise. Both had extreme energy requirements (3300 kcal/day; 3500 kcal/day). The baseline swallowing scores of case 1 and 2 were as follows: PAS, 8 and 8; Yale, 9 and 10; NZSS, 4 and 7; and FOIS, 1 and 1, respectively, indicating profound dysphagia. At week 3 of 7 of RMST, swallow function improved to allow both to commence oral intake, followed by tracheostomy decannulation. At weeks 10 and 11, full dysphagia resolution was achieved (FOIS = 7; PAS = 1, Yale = 2, NZSS = 0), with PEF at 70% and 48% predicted respectively.

There is concern about hemolysis after plasma and plasma-containing platelet transfusions due to naturally occurring anti-T antibody in healthy blood donors. However, experts have debated the extent and severity of clinical hemolysis due to anti-T. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively identified patients who tested positive for polyagglutination with Arachis hypogea and Glycine max lectins from 2008 to 2019. The records of the patients were reviewed to determine clinical symptoms, laboratory evidence of hemolysis, need for transfusion, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Ten patients were identified. At diagnosis, all were anemic and four had thrombocytopenia. Severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection affected seven patients; one died. Seven of 10 patients (70%) had laboratory evidence of hemolysis. Peripheral blood smear findings in six patients included RBC agglutination and changes suggesting hemolysis (spherocytes and schistocytes), but three had unremarkable RBC morphology. Four patients required plasma or platelet transfusions; all survived to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: T-antigen activation is a rare entity.

In this study, we performed a controlled disease trial on 120 full-sib families to (i) quantify and characterize the potential of genomic selection for survival to S. agalactiae infection in Nile tilapia, and (ii) identify the best genomic model and the optimal density of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for this trait. METHODS: In total, 40 fish per family (15 fish intraperitoneally injected and 25 fish as cohabitants) were used in the challenge test. Mortalities were recorded every 3 h for 35 days. After quality control, genotypes (50,690 SNPs) and phenotypes (0 for dead and 1 for alive) for 2472 cohabitant fish were available. Genetic parameters were obtained using various genomic selection models (genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), BayesB, BayesC, BayesR and BayesS) and a traditional pedigree-based model (PBLUP). The pedigree-based analysis used a deep 17-generation pedigree. Prediction accuracy and bias were evaluated using five replicates of tenfold cross-validation. The genomic models were further analyzed using 10 subsets of SNPs at different densities to explore the effect of pruning and SNP density on predictive accuracy. RESULTS: Moderate estimates of heritabilities ranging from 0.15 +/- 0.03 to 0.26 +/- 0.05 were obtained with the different models. Compared to a pedigree-based model, GBLUP (using all the SNPs) increased prediction accuracy by 15.4%. Furthermore, use of the most appropriate Bayesian genomic selection model and SNP density increased the prediction accuracy up to 71%. The 40 to 50 SNPs with non-zero effects were consistent for all BayesB, BayesC and BayesS models with respect to marker id and/or marker locations.

Effector T helper (Th) 17 cells is a relatively newly discovered subpopulation of helper CD4(+) T lymphocytes, by expressing interleukin (IL)-17A play crucial roles in host defenses against a variety of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. However, whether S. agalactiae infection can induce the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into Th17 cells, and whether IL-17A can play an effective role against S. agalactiae infections, are still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the responses of CD4(+) T cells and their defensive effects after S. agalactiae infection. The results showed that S. agalactiae infection induce not only the formation of Th1 cells expressing interferon (IFN)-gamma, but also the differentiation of mouse splenic CD4(+) T cells into Th17 cells, which highly express IL-17A.

Interestingly, S. agalactiae strains belonging to the hypervirulent Sequence Type 17 (ST17) contain significantly fewer spacers in their CRISPR locus than other lineages, which could be the result of a less functional CRISPR-Cas system. Here, we revealed one large deletion in the ST17 cas promoter region and we evaluated its impact on the transcription of cas genes as well as the functionalities of the CRISPR-Cas system. We demonstrated that Cas9 interference is functional and that the CRISPR-Cas system of ST17 strains can still acquire new spacers, despite the absence of a regular cas promoter.

Overall, 105/192 (54.7%) of BacT/Alert PF Plus bottles and 69/192 (36.0%) of Bactec Peds Plus bottles allowed organisms to grow when exposed to antibiotics. In particular, both BacT/Alert PF Plus and Bactec Peds Plus bottles proved to be effective with piperacillin/tazobactam and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or with oxacillin and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (100% growth), whereas no effectiveness was apparent with ceftriaxone and Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae or with cefepime and E. coli (0% growth). In some relevant instances (e.g., with vancomycin and methicillin-resistant S. aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae), BacT/Alert PF Plus bottles were superior to Bactec Peds Plus bottles.

This drop in pH below six causes hindgut acidosis and may lead to laminitis. Lactic acid-producing bacteria Streptococcus equinus and Mitsuokella jalaludinii have been found to produce high amounts of L-lactate and D-lactate, respectively. Early detection of increased levels of these bacteria could allow the horse owner to tailor the horse's diet to avoid hindgut acidosis and subsequent laminitis. Therefore, 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences were identified and modified to obtain target single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from these bacteria. Complementary single stranded DNAs were designed from the modified target sequences to form capture probes. Binding between capture probe and target single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) in solution has been studied by gel electrophoresis. Among pairs of different capture probes and target single stranded DNA, hybridization of Streptococcus equinus capture probe 1 (SECP1) and Streptococcus equinus target 1 (SET1) was portrayed as gel electrophoresis. Adsorptive stripping voltammetry was utilized to study the binding of thiol modified SECP1 over gold on glass substrates and these studies showed a consistent binding signal of thiol modified SECP1 and their hybridization with SET1 over the gold working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed to examine the binding of thiol modified SECP1 on the gold working electrode and hybridization of thiol modified SECP1 with the target single stranded DNA. Both demonstrated the gold working electrode surface was modified with a capture probe layer and hybridization of the thiol bound ssDNA probe with target DNA was indicated.

METHODS: A pool-and-split method was used, with two treated units and one untreated control per inoculum concentration. Pairs of PC bags were inoculated with a single bacterial species. Three concentrations (n = 2 per concentration), which incremented tenfold, were tested initially based on published data from the manufacturer. Dependent on these results, the concentrations subsequently tested were either increased or decreased until the inactivation capability of the system was derived. Bacterial count was determined post-spiking, immediately prior to treatment (2 h from spiking), immediately after treatment and at the end of shelf life (day seven). Enrichment culture was performed immediately prior to treatment, after treatment and at the end of shelf life. RESULTS: The inactivation capabilities, in CFU/ml, of Intercept and Mirasol, respectively, at the end of PC shelf life were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus >/= 10(7) , <10(1) ; Staphylococcus epidermidis >/=10(6) , <10(2) ; Klebsiella pneumoniae 10(5) , <10(1) ; Streptococcus bovis >/=10(7) , 10(1) , Escherichia coli >/=10(6) , <10(1) ; Streptococcus pneumoniae >/=10(6) , 10(3) ; Streptococcus mitis >/=10(7) , 10(1) ; Listeria monocytogenes >/=10(7) , 10(1) ; Streptococcus dysgalactiae >/=10(7) , <10(1) ; Serratia marcescens 10(3) , <10(1) ; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10(3) , Mirasol not tested; and Bacillus cereus < 10(2) , Mirasol not tested. CONCLUSION: The inactivation capability of Intercept was greater than that of Mirasol. Inactivation capability (by terminal sterility) is the most meaningful measure to evaluate a PI system for bacteria, rather than logarithmic reduction assessed immediately after treatment by plate count. PI offers a possible alternative to bacterial screening if treatment is performed at an appropriate time dependent on the inactivation capabilities of the system.",1423-0410 (Electronic) 0042-9007 (Linking),2021 Apr,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3230-3287'],['10.1111/vox.13040 [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['bacteria', 'blood safety', 'pathogen inactivation', 'platelet component']",['(c) 2021 International Society of Blood Transfusion.'],,

The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design with five treatments and four replications. The treatments consisted of a group of animals kept on pasture that received low consumption supplementation (LS) and four groups that received for 98 days, 17.5 g concentrate kg(-1) body weight. The supplements were composed of the association of additives: urea (U), slow-release non-protein nitrogen (U+SRN), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; U+SRN+Y), and bacterial probiotics (live strains of bacteria; U+SRN+Y+BP). All supplements also contained salinomycin and virginiamycin.

The abundance of F. succinogenes was the same for the LS animals and those that received the supplement U+SRN+Y (1.42x10(8) copies mL(-1)) but higher than the other treatments. Supplementation reduced by 90% the abundance of S. bovis compared to the LS. The inclusion of yeast increased the abundance of fibrolytic bacteria by 2.2-fold.

Twenty-eight lambs were divided into four groups: unsupplemented animals (Control), animals supplemented with organic zinc (Zn, 70 mg Zn/kg diet), animals supplemented with a mixture of dry medicinal herbs (Herbs, 100 g dry matter (DM)/d) and animals supplemented with both zinc and herbs (Zn+Herbs). Each lamb was fed a basal diet composed of meadow hay (700 g DM/d) and barley (300 g DM/d). The herbs Fumaria officinalis L. (FO), Malva sylvestris L. (MS), Artemisia absinthium L. (AA) and Matricaria chamomilla L. (MC) were mixed in equal proportions. The lambs were slaughtered after 70 d. The ruminal contents were used to determine the parameters of fermentation in vitro and in vivo and to quantify the microbes by molecular and microscopic methods. Samples of fresh ruminal tissue were used for histopathological evaluation. Quantitative analyses of the bioactive compounds in FO, MS, AA, and MC identified 3.961, 0.654, 6.482, and 12.084 g/kg DM phenolic acids and 12.211, 6.479, 0.349, and 2.442 g/kg DM flavonoids, respectively. The alkaloid content in FO was 6.015 g/kg DM. The diets affected the levels of total gas, methane and n-butyrate in vitro (P < 0.046, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively). Relative quantification by real-time PCR indicated a lower total ruminal bacterial population in the lambs in the Zn and Zn+Herbs groups than the Control group (P < 0.05). The relative abundances of Ruminococcus albus, R. flavefaciens, Streptococcus bovis, and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus shifted in the Zn group. Morphological observation found a focally mixed infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lamina propria of the rumen in the Zn+Herbs group.

In the study, the taxonomic composition of the sputum microbiome of 66 men with untreated LC were compared to 62 control subjects with respect to CA and MN frequency and centromere FISH analysis. Results showed a significant increase in CA (4.11 +/- 2.48% vs 2.08 +/- 1.18%) and MN (1.53 +/- 0.67% vs 0.87 +/- 0.49%) frequencies respectively in LC patients as compared to control subjects. The higher frequency of centromeric positive MN of LC patients was mainly due to aneuploidy. A significant increase in Streptococcus, Bacillus, Gemella and Haemophilus in LC patients, in comparison to the control subjects while 18 bacterial genera were significantly reduced, which indicates a decrease in the beta diversity in the microbiome of LC patients. Although, the CA frequency in LC patients is significantly associated with an increased presence of the genera Bacteroides, Lachnoanaerobaculum, Porphiromonas, Mycoplasma and Fusobacterium in their sputum, and a decrease for the genus Granulicatella after application of false discovery rate (FDR) correction significance was not any more present. The decrease of MN frequency of LC patients is significantly associated with a increase in Megasphaera genera and Selenonomas bovis.

Among 51 SBSEC isolates collected, two SBSEC members (S. equinus and S. lutetiensis) were identified; sodA-based phylogenetic analyses and comparisons of overall genome relatedness revealed potential plasticity and diversity. The AMR rates of these SBSEC against erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline were relatively lower than those of other SBSEC isolates of a clinical origin. An investigation of the ARGs against those antimicrobials indicated that tetracycline resistance of SBSECs generally correlated with the presence of tet(M)-possessing Tn916-like transposon. However, no correlation between the presence of ARGs and phenotypic resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was observed.

The opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus was recently shown to outcompete commensal enterococci of the murine microbiota under tumoral conditions thanks to the production of a two-peptide bacteriocin named gallocin. Here, we identified four genes involved in the regulatory control of gallocin in S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus UCN34 that encode a histidine kinase/response regulator two-component system (BlpH/BlpR), a secreted peptide (GSP [gallocin-stimulating peptide]), and a putative regulator of unknown function (BlpS). While BlpR is a typical 243-amino-acid (aa) response regulator possessing a phospho-receiver domain and a LytTR DNA-binding domain, BlpS is a 108-aa protein containing only a LytTR domain. Our results showed that the secreted peptide GSP activates the dedicated two-component system BlpH/BlpR to induce gallocin transcription. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis indicates that this regulatory system (GSP-BlpH/BlpR) is specific for bacteriocin production. Importantly, as opposed to BlpR, BlpS was shown to repress gallocin gene transcription. A conserved operator DNA sequence of 30 bp was found in all promoter regions regulated by BlpR and BlpS. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and footprint assays showed direct and specific binding of BlpS and BlpR to various regulated promoter regions in a dose-dependent manner on this conserved sequence. Gallocin expression appears to be tightly controlled in S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus by quorum sensing and antagonistic activity of 2 LytTR-containing proteins. Competition experiments in gut microbiota medium and 5% CO2 to mimic intestinal conditions demonstrate that gallocin is functional under these in vivo-like conditions.IMPORTANCE Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus, formerly known as Streptococcus bovis biotype I, is an opportunistic pathogen causing septicemia and endocarditis in the elderly often associated with asymptomatic colonic neoplasia. Recent studies indicate that S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is both a driver and a passenger of colorectal cancer. We previously showed that S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus produces a bacteriocin, termed gallocin, enabling colonization of the colon under tumoral conditions by outcompeting commensal members of the murine microbiota such as Enterococcus faecalis Here, we identified and extensively characterized a four-component system that regulates gallocin production. Gallocin gene transcription is activated by a secreted peptide pheromone (GSP) and a two-component signal transduction system composed of a transmembrane histidine kinase receptor (BlpH) and a cytosolic response regulator (BlpR). Finally, a DNA-binding protein (BlpS) was found to repress gallocin genes transcription, likely by antagonizing BlpR.

Many bacterial processes are QS-regulated; two examples are the highly related traits of the natural genetic competence state and the production of antimicrobial peptides such as bacteriocins. The Streptococcus genus is widely studied for its competence and for its ability to produce bacteriocins, as these antimicrobial peptides have significant potential in the treatment of infections caused by multiple-resistant pathogens, a severe public health issue. The transduction of a two-component system controls competence in streptococci: (1) ComD/E, which controls the competence in the Mitis and Anginosus groups, and (2) ComR/S, which performs the same function in the Bovis, Mutans, Salivarius, and Pyogenic groups. The cell-to-cell communication required for bacteriocin production in the Streptococcus groups is controlled mainly by a paralog of the ComD/E system. The relationships between pheromone signals and induction pathways are related to the bacteriocin production systems. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in the understanding of signaling and the induction of bacteriocin biosynthesis by QS regulation in streptococci. This information could aid in the design of better methods for the development and production of these antimicrobial peptides. It could also contribute to the analysis and emerging applications of bacteriocins in terms of their safety, quality, and human health benefits.",1573-0972 (Electronic) 0959-3993 (Linking),2021 Jan 4,,"['10.1007/s11274-020-02973-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11274-020-02973-5 [pii]']",['eng'],Germany,"['Bacteriocin', 'Biotechnological applications', 'Competence state', 'Quorum sensing', 'Streptococcus spp.']",,,

Twenty-four cheek pouches from 12 male Syrian hamsters received 7-min treatment with pure water (PW), 3% H2O2, laser irradiation of PW at 100mW, laser irradiation of 3% H2O2 at 100mW, laser irradiation of PW at 200mW, or laser irradiation of 3% H2O2 at 200mW (n=4 each). The diameter of the irradiation area was set at 3mm; accordingly, the calculated irradiances (optical power densities) of the 100- and 200-mW laser lights were approximately 1400 and 2800mW/cm(2), respectively. In addition, 12 cheek pouches from six animals received laser irradiation of 3% H2O2 at 100mW for 1, 3, or 5min (n=4 each). Each treatment was repeated three times at 1-h intervals. Macroscopic and histological changes were evaluated 24h after the last treatment. In addition, in vitro bactericidal activity of the treatment against periodontal pathogens was evaluated.

However, the safety of this treatment has not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of this treatment on the oral mucosa in hamsters and wounded skin in rats. An oral mucosal irritation test was performed in hamsters. The cheek pouch was everted and treated with UVA irradiation (wavelength: 365nm) of pure water, 1mg/mL of caffeic acid, or 1mg/mL of grape seed extract using a light-emitting diode at an irradiance of 275mW/cm(2). Each treatment was performed for 2 or 5min and repeated three times. Macroscopic and histological evaluations were performed 24h after the last treatment.

Full-thickness skin wounds created on the back of the rats were treated for 2min as described above, but only once. The wound area was then assessed daily for 9days. The results demonstrated that the treatment induced oral mucosal irritation depending on the irradiation time; however, it did not influence the wound healing process. The oral mucosal irritation potential of three treatment sessions performed for 2 and 5min was minimal and mild to moderate, respectively, according to histological analysis.

The oral microbiota plays important roles in oral and systemic health, and the disruption in the oral microbial population is linked to periodontal disease and other health problems. To assess the impact of smokeless tobacco on oral microbiota in vivo, high-throughput sequencing was used to examine the oral microbiota present in Syrian Golden hamster cheek pouches. Sixteen hamsters were divided into four groups and treated with the STP Grizzly snuff (0, 2.5, 25, or 250mg) twice daily for 4 weeks. After 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of treatment, bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from oral swabs sampled from the cheek pouches of the hamsters. The oral bacterial communities present in different hamster groups were characterized by sequencing the hypervariable regions V1-V2 and V4 of 16S rRNA using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Fifteen phyla, 27 classes, 59 orders, 123 families, and 250 genera were identified from 4,962,673 sequence reads from the cheek pouch samples. The bacterial diversity and taxonomic abundances for the different treatment groups were compared to the non-treated hamsters. Bacterial diversity was significantly decreased after 4 weeks of exposure to 2.5mg, and significantly increased by exposure to 250mg STP. Treatment with 250mg STP significantly increased Firmicutes, transiently increased Cyanobacteria and TM7, and decreased Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria compared to the control group. At the genus level, 4 weeks of administration of 250mg STP significantly increased Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Oribacterium, Anaerococcus, Acidaminococcus, Actinomyces, Eubacterium, Negativicoccus, and Staphylococcus, and decreased Bacteroides, Buleidia, Dialister, and Leptotrichia, and transiently decreased Arcanobacterium compared to the control group. For the first time, an animal model was used for evaluating the effects of STP on oral microbiota by metagenomic sequencing.

This study aimed to identify the intracellular active component of ST-1 associated with anti-oxidative activity against LDL oxidation. High-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry analysis after fractionation of the cellular extract by reversed-phase chromatography demonstrated that the active fraction contained reduced glutathione (GSH). GSH showed anti-oxidative activity in a dose-dependent manner, while this activity disappeared following thiol derivatisation. ST-1 had the strongest anti-oxidative activity against LDL oxidation and the highest level of intracellular GSH among five strains of S. thermophilus. In addition, the anti-oxidative activity of ST-1 after thiol derivatisation decreased by about half, which was similar to that of three other strains containing poor or no intracellular GSH or thiol components. Moreover, anti-oxidative activity against LDL oxidation was observed in hyperlipidaemic hamsters fed with high GSH ST-1 cells but not in those given low GSH cells.

When these mutants were compared to the pgsA745 cell line, a CHO xylosyltransferase mutant generated previously using chemical mutagenesis, an unexpected result was obtained. Bacterial invasion of pgsA745 cells by group B Streptococcus (GBS), group A Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus was markedly reduced compared to the invasion of wild-type cells, but newly generated CRISPR-cas9 mutants were only resistant to GBS. Invasion of pgsA745 cells was not restored by transfection with xylosyltransferase, suggesting that an additional mutation conferring panresistance to multiple bacteria was present in pgsA745 cells. Whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) uncovered a deletion in the gene encoding the laminin subunit alpha2 (Lama2) that eliminated much of domain L4a. Silencing of the long Lama2 isoform in wild-type cells strongly reduced bacterial invasion, whereas transfection with human LAMA2 cDNA significantly enhanced invasion in pgsA745 cells. The addition of exogenous laminin-alpha2beta1gamma1/laminin-alpha2beta2gamma1 strongly increased bacterial invasion in CHO cells, as well as in human alveolar basal epithelial and human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Thus, the L4a domain in laminin alpha2 is important for cellular invasion by a number of bacterial pathogens. IMPORTANCE: Pathogenic bacteria penetrate host cellular barriers by attachment to extracellular matrix molecules, such as proteoglycans, laminins, and collagens, leading to invasion of epithelial and endothelial cells. Here, we show that cellular invasion by the human pathogens group B Streptococcus, group A Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus depends on a specific domain of the laminin alpha2 subunit.

In the chronic O. viverrini-infected group, bacterial community composition and diversity were significantly increased compared to controls.

In addition, Helicobacter pylori (0.17% of sequences) was also identified in the liver of chronic O. viverrini infections, but not in normal liver. The presence of H. pylori was confirmed by PCR and by use of an antibody against bacterial antigen, supporting the metagenomics data. The identities of bacteria cultured for enrichment suggested that chronic O. viverrini infection changes the liver microbiome and promotes Helicobacter spp. growth.

RESULTS: Out of 466 LRE received at the National Reference Centre for Enterococci over the period, 47 (10.1%) were poxtA-positive, including 42 E. faecium. The 11 isolates characterized by WGS were confirmed to be epidemiologically unrelated by core genome analysis and eight different STs were assigned to E. faecium isolates. The poxtA gene was found to be plasmid carried and flanked by IS1216E transposase genes in all isolates and frequently linked with fexB, tet(M) and tet(L). A total of seven distinct poxtA-harbouring plasmids were obtained after hybrid assembly and plasmid transfer of poxtA was successful in three cases. For the two poxtA/optrA-positive isolates, those genes were carried by different plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: The poxtA gene has been circulating among clinical enterococci in France since at least 2016, mostly in E. faecium and independently from optrA. The poxtA-carrying plasmids often co-carried resistance genes to phenicols and tetracyclines, and could have been co-selected through their veterinary use.",1460-2091 (Electronic) 0305-7453 (Linking),2021 Apr 25,,"['6251856 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkab116 [doi]']",['eng'],England,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

In the in vitro system, piglet digesta was inoculated with pathogenic enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4 (ETEC F4), and the short-chain fatty acid profile and the gut microbiota composition were assessed. Four probiotic strains were evaluated: Enterococcus faecium (CHCC 10669), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (CHCC 11994), Bifidobacterium breve (CHCC 15268) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (CHCC 28556). The significant differences observed in short chain fatty acid profile and enumeration of Enterobacteriaceae, ETEC F4 and lactic acid bacteria were attributed to variation in inoculating material or pathogen challenge rather than probiotic treatment. Probiotic administration influenced the microbiota composition to a small extend. In vitro models mimicking the small intestine of piglets do seem to be a relevant tool for investigating mode of action of probiotics. However, learnings from the present study indicate that the experimental setup, including incubation time and choice of inoculating material, should be chosen with care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal samples from 24 teeth in different patients with persistent endodontic infections were obtained. The isolated strains were identified by biochemical tests and 16S rDNA sequencing. Genotyping was achieved by molecular methods. The antibacterial activity of antibiotics and copper nanostructures was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values. Furthermore, a time-kill kinetics assay was evaluated. Nonparametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) were performed (p value <0.05). RESULTS: Twenty-one isolated strains were identified. Six isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were grouped into two clusters of three isolates each, two of which were clones. All were clarithromycin-resistant and erythromycin. Eight Pseudomonas putida presented two clusters, two Pseudomonas spp. were not clonal, and all were resistant to the tested antibiotics except tetracycline. Two of five strains of Cutibacterium acnes were clonal, and all were resistant only to metronidazole. The lowest MIC and MBC values were obtained with Cu-NPs. Time-kill kinetics using Cu-NPs showed a significant decrease in all tested species within 4 h and reached 100% in 2 h for C. acnes. CONCLUSION: In this study, in relation to health care-associated infections, endodontic strains of each species isolated at least in one patient were polyclonal. In Pseudomonas spp., at least one clone was shared between patients. E. faecalis and C. acnes strains were susceptible to low Cu-NP concentrations, while Pseudomonas spp. strains were resistant. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Assessing and keeping track of the susceptibility of clinical strains to antimicrobial compounds is important for the clinical outcome.

Identifying new modes of treating infections is of increasing importance, as antibiotic resistance has escalated. Streptococcus mutans is an important opportunistic pathogen that is an agent of dental caries and is capable of systemic diseases such as endocarditis. As such, understanding how it regulates virulence and competes in the oral niche is a priority in developing strategies to defend from these pathogens. We determined that S. mutans UA159 possesses a bona fide short hydrophobic peptide (SHP)/Rgg quorum-sensing system that regulates a specialized biosynthetic operon featuring a radical-SAM (S-adenosyl-l-methionine) (RaS) enzyme and produces a ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP). The pairing of SHP/Rgg regulatory systems with RaS biosynthetic operons is conserved across streptococci, and a locus similar to that in S. mutans is found in Streptococcus ferus, an oral streptococcus isolated from wild rats. We identified the RaS-RiPP product from this operon and solved its structure using a combination of analytical methods; we term these RiPPs tryglysin A and B for the unusual Trp-Gly-Lys linkage. We report that tryglysins specifically inhibit the growth of other streptococci, but not other Gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis or Lactococcus lactis We predict that tryglysin is produced by S. mutans in its oral niche, thus inhibiting the growth of competing species, including several medically relevant streptococci.IMPORTANCE Bacteria interact and compete with a large community of organisms in their natural environment. Streptococcus mutans is one such organism, and it is an important member of the oral microbiota. We found that S. mutans uses a quorum-sensing system to regulate production of a novel posttranslationally modified peptide capable of inhibiting growth of several streptococcal species. We find inhibitory properties of a similar peptide produced by S. ferus and predict that these peptides play a role in interspecies competition in the oral niche.",2150-7511 (Electronic),2021 Mar 16,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3178-4269', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4554-543X']","['mBio.02688-20 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.02688-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['*Streptococcus', '*antimicrobial peptides', '*bacteriocins', '*quorum sensing']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Rued et al.'],,

METHODS AND RESULTS: When pure cultures were used with traditional culture-based media, mitis-salivarius bacitracin (MSB) agar demonstrated less support for bacterial recovery than trypticase-yeast extract-cysteine sucrose-bacitracin (TYCSB) agar and the modified medium of Ritz (HLR-S). One species of MS, Streptococcus ferus (c), was not recovered on MSB medium. Chairside cultural tests displayed considerable disparity between tests in recovering bacteria from pure cultures. On the glass adherence assay (Mucount), S. ferus was not detected and Streptococcus criceti was not detected on the dipslide assay (Cariescreen SM) or on the plastic adherence assay (Dentocult SM Strip mutans). The frequency of isolation of pure strains of bacteria other than MS was common. From saliva samples, the frequency of isolation of MS on HLR-S and TYCSB media and the glass adherence assay was 91-97%. The frequency of isolation on MSB medium and on the dip-slide and plastic adherence assays was significantly decreased (37, 47 and 69%, respectively). Recovery scores varied considerably among the culture methods studied and tended to be highest on the HLR-S medium and on the glass adherence assay.

These bacteria have been identified by conventional methods such as biochemical and serologic tests followed by the isolation of colonies on the mitis-salivarius agar, which are sometimes inconsistent. Recently, species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been reported to rapidly identify Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. However, in the case of identification and classification into several species, e.g. within the group of mutans streptococci consisting of seven species, the identification using species-specific PCR seems somewhat inefficient because of need for the development and preparation of specific primers for each species. Therefore, in this study we developed a simple method using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes (16S rRNA genes PCR-RFLP) for the identification of seven different species included in the group of mutans streptococci. We amplified 16S rRNA gene sequences from genomic DNA samples by PCR using universal primers and digested the PCR products with the restriction endonucleases, HpaII and HaeIII. HpaII produced six RFLP patterns for eight reference strains, since the patterns for S. sobrinus, Streptococcus downei and Streptococcus ferus were similar. RFLP patterns produced with HaeIII could separate these three species. Furthermore, the RFLP patterns predicted from the 16S rRNA gene sequences in the GenBank database agreed with the actual RFLP patterns produced in the present study. The 16S rRNA sequence comparisons can be used to identify oral mutans streptococci; however, the identification by sequencing is sometimes difficult in large-scale studies and for small laboratories. Therefore, 16S rRNA genes PCR-RFLP, using HpaII and HaeIII, could be an alternative method for the identification of mutans streptococci, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the cariogenicity of mutans streptococci.",0902-0055 (Print) 0902-0055 (Linking),2003 Oct,,"['095 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1399-302x.2003.00095.x [doi]']",['eng'],Denmark,,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease HpaII)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (GGCC-specific type II deoxyribonucleases)']","['DNA Primers', 'DNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'Deoxyribonuclease HpaII', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/*analysis/genetics', 'Serotyping', 'Species Specificity', 'Streptococcus/*classification/genetics', 'Streptococcus mutans/*classification/genetics', 'Streptococcus sobrinus/classification/genetics']"

METHODS: Whole genome of EG81 was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq platform combined with the Nanopore PromethION platform, and assembled de novo using Canu v1.5. NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) was used to annotate the genome of EG81. Antimicrobial resistance genes were identified using CGE ResFinder 3.2. RESULTS: The genome of EG81 consists of one 3,433,237-bp chromosome and two plasmids, pEG81-1 (51,632 bp) and pEG81-2 (3425 bp). A total of 3285 coding sequences and 80 RNA genes were predicted by PGAP. The oxazolidinone-phenicol resistance gene optrA is located on both the chromosome and plasmid pEG81-1 associated with Tn554 and Tn558, respectively.

To our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate gut microbiota diversity and composition in 36 children from the Republic of Serbia diagnosed with NDD and 28 healthy children. The results revealed an increased incidence of potentially harmful bacteria, closely related to Clostridium species, in the NDD patient group compared to the Control group: Desulfotomaculum guttoideum (P < 0.01), Intestinibacter bartlettii (P < 0.05), and Romboutsia ilealis (P < 0.001). On the other hand, significantly lower diversity of common commensal bacteria in the NDD group of patients was noticed. Enterococcus faecalis (P < 0.05), Enterococcus gallinarum (P < 0.01), Streptococcus pasteurianus (P < 0.05), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (P < 0.01) and Bifidobacteria sp. were detected in lower numbers of patients or were even absent in some NDD patients. In addition, butyrate-producing bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P < 0.01), Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum (P < 0.05), and Eubacterium rectale (P = 0.07) were less frequent in the NDD patient group. In line with that, the levels of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were determined. Although significant differences in SCFA levels were not detected between NDD patients and the Control group, a positive correlation was noted between number of rDNA amplicons obtained with universal primers and level of propionic acid, as well as a trend for levels of total SCFAs and butyric acid in the Control group. This correlation is lost in the NDD patient group, indicating that NDD patients' microbiota differs from the microbiota of healthy children in the presence or number of strong SCFA-producing bacteria. According to a range-weighted richness index it was observed that microbial diversity was significantly lower in the NDD patient group. Our study reveals that the intestinal microbiota from NDD patients differs from the microbiota of healthy children.

In total, 43 VRE isolates were obtained from various clinical sites throughout the years 2013-2014, including 40 vanA-type and 2 vanB-type vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates and 1 vanC1-type Enterococcus gallinarum. Of the 42 E. faecium, 19 isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing. Core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) analysis revealed three sequence clusters (SCs) of clonally related isolates, which were linked to different hospital wards. The first two VRE isolates, isolated early 2013 from patients in the medical intensive care unit, were grouped in SC1 (MLST [ST] 78, vanB) and differed in only 3 of 1423 cgMLST alleles. The SC2 (n = 16, special care baby unit, neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric surgery ward, and oncology ward) and SC3 (n = 1, antenatal ward) were all ST80 vanA-VRE, but the single SC3 isolate differed in 233 alleles compared with SC2. Within SC2, isolates differed in 1-23 alleles. Comparison with a larger database of E. faecium strains indicated that all isolates clustered within the previously defined hospital clade A1. A combination of Resfinder and mlplasmid analysis identified the presence of resistance genes on different plasmid predicted genetic elements among different SCs.

The silages were undertaken in wet and spray-dried fish-based raw-materials for 3 weeks at room temperature (ca. 25 degrees C). Selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) of Enterococcus gallinarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Streptococcus spp. were employed to produce fermented fish-based silages, while acidified silage was prepared resorting to the addition of formic acid (3%, v/v). Lactic and propionic acids were the dominant produced organic acids, while succinic acid was formed at the smallest amounts in fermented silages. In the acidified silage, lactic and formic acids were produced in amounts higher than 800 and 1000 mg organic acid/100g sample, respectively. Among the fermented fish-based silages, LAB strains unfolded considerable ability to presumptively produce propionic acid in gibel carp silage (>2370 mg organic acid/100g sample). Spray-dried fermented silages displayed significantly higher organic acid content than wet silages. Propionic acid accumulation was found at the highest levels in gibel carp silage fermented with L. plantarum (6335.40 mg propionic acid/100g sample). This research effort pointed out the good capability of various selected lactic acid bacteria strains to produce significant amounts of organic acids-especially lactic, acetic, and propionic acids-during the fermentation of fish-based silages.

Different co-culture models were employed to determine phagocytosis rates of Streptococcus mitis or Staphylococcus aureus contaminating a dental implant surface and the influence of contaminating bacteria and osteoblasts (U2OS) on macrophage polarisation. S. aureus was phagocytized in higher numbers than S. mitis in bi-cultures on smooth Ti-P surfaces. Contaminating S. mitis stimulated near full polarisation of macrophages from a non-Ym1-expressing- to a Ym1-expressing-phenotype on smooth Ti-P, but on ZrO2-MA both phenotypes occurred. In tri-cultures with U2OS-cells on smooth Ti-P, a larger percentage of macrophages remained in their non-Ym1-expressing, ""fighting"" M1-like phenotype to clear Ti-P surfaces from contaminating bacteria. On ZrO2-MA surfaces, more macrophages tended towards their ""fix- and-repair"" M2-like phenotype than on Ti-P surfaces. Surface coverage of smooth, bacterially contaminated Ti-P surfaces by U2OS-cells was more effectively stimulated by fighting, M1-like macrophages than on ZrO2-MA surfaces.

Aims: To evaluate a combination of hydroxyapatite and lysozyme, lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase for the treatment of dentinal caries by measuring viable Streptococcus mutans. Settings and Design: Laboratory study with experimental groups. Methods and Material: Carious lesions in 20 permanent third molars were treated with a combination of hydroxyapatite and the enzymes lysozyme, lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase. Carious dentin was collected and homogenized in a vortex shaker. After homogenization, five decimal dilutions were performed. Three aliquots of 25 muL of each dilution were seeded onto the surface of mitis salivarius bacitracin (MSB) medium. All plates were incubated in anaerobic jars. After incubation, the viable bacterial count was determined. S. mutans counts were obtained before and 24 h, 1 month, and 6 months after treatment. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive statistical analysis and the Kruskal-Wallis test, supplemented by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. Results: A significant reduction in S. mutans counts was observed 24 h after sealing with a combination of hydroxyapatite, lysozyme, lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase as compared to counts after 1 month and after 6 months (P < 0.05).

Due to slowness and sometimes difficulty in interpretation, the bile solubility test has fallen into disuse. The main objective of this work was to assess the current effectiveness of the optochin susceptibility test in pneumococcal identification in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overall 126 viridans group streptococci consecutively isolated from respiratory samples were analyzed using the optochin susceptibility test by picking one colony from the culture. Sixty-two were initially considered optochin susceptible, and 64 were considered optochin resistant and analyzed with the bile solubility test. If a discrepancy between the tests was observed (i.e., whether an isolate was optochin susceptible and bile insoluble or optochin resistant and bile soluble), then the optochin susceptibility test was repeated, adjusting the inoculum to a McFarland standard of 0.5. Species were identified by sequencing the lytA and recA genes. RESULTS: Twelve discrepancies were initially observed. The result of the repeated optochin test showed that the initial optochin test of 4 isolates had been wrongly interpreted. Of the remaining 8 discrepancies, 2 optochin-resistant bile-soluble isolates were identified by gene sequencing as S. pneumoniae, and of the 6 optochin-susceptible bile-nonsoluble isolates, 3 were identified as Streptococcus mitis and 3 as Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The optochin test correctly identified 90.5% of all recent viridans group streptococci clinical isolates which include both optochin susceptible (62/126 = 49.2%) and optochin resistant (64/126 = 50.8%) strains. Of the group of optochin susceptible viridans, 87.5% were correctly identified, and 93.5% of the optochin resistant group were correctly identified. However, this technique does not correctly differentiate between S. pneumoniae from other viridans group streptococci in the clinical setting. Additional testing is needed for that identification.",1433-6510 (Print) 1433-6510 (Linking),2021 Mar 1,,['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200438 [doi]'],['eng'],Germany,,,,

Oral tissues are generally homeostatic despite exposure to many potential inflammatory agents including the resident microbiota. This requires the balancing of inflammation by regulatory mechanisms and/or anti-inflammatory commensal bacteria. Thus, the levels of anti-inflammatory commensal bacteria in resident populations may be critical in maintaining this homeostatic balance.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. The incidence of immunosuppressive streptococci in the oral cavity is not well established. Determining the proportion of these organisms and the mechanisms involved may help to understand host-microbe homeostasis and inform development of probiotics or prebiotics in the maintenance of oral health.Aim. To determine the incidence and potential modes of action of immunosuppressive capacity in resident oral streptococci.Methodology. Supragingival plaque was collected from five healthy participants and supragingival and subgingival plaque from five with gingivitis. Twenty streptococci from each sample were co-cultured with epithelial cells+/-flagellin or LL-37. CXCL8 secretion was detected by ELISA, induction of cytotoxicity in human epithelial cells by lactate dehydrogenase release and NFkappaB-activation using a reporter cell line. Bacterial identification was achieved through partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and next-generation sequencing.Results. CXCL8 secretion was inhibited by 94/300 isolates. Immunosuppressive isolates were detected in supragingival plaque from healthy (4/5) and gingivitis (4/5) samples, and in 2/5 subgingival (gingivitis) plaque samples. Most were Streptococcus mitis/oralis. Seventeen representative immunosuppressive isolates all inhibited NFkappaB activation. The immunosuppressive mechanism was strain specific, often mediated by ultra-violet light-labile factors, whilst bacterial viability was essential in certain species.Conclusion. Many streptococci isolated from plaque suppressed epithelial cell CXCL8 secretion, via inhibition of NFkappaB.

Growth rate was measured by dry weight (DW) and optical density (OD)550 nm. Additionally, phytochemical compounds, defense enzymes as well as antioxidant activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(.+)) radical assays of crude extracts (methylene chloride:methanol, 1:1) were evaluated. Based on antioxidant activity, four promising extracts were subjected to different biological activities such as anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral activities. The obtained results revealed that supplementation of external nitrogen source in the form of sodium nitrate was found to increase the total phycobiliprotein content by fivefold. Also, nitrogen depletion provoked significantly highest quantities of phenolic and flavonoid content and this has effects on biological activities of Nostoc linckia.

Currently, the group of probiotic microorganisms includes bacteria that produce lactic acid of the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, belonging to the so-called LAB (lactic acid bacteria) groups, and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. Probiotics have a protective role in Candida spp. oral infection and especially colonization. Lactobacillus limits the progression of chronic periodontitis by inhibiting the secretory activity of Th17 lymphocytes, which in the pathogenesis of this disease are responsible for an excessive cytokine response causing adverse changes in periodontal tissues. A meta-analysis of the results of studies on the clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of gingivitis showed that the use of probiotics improved the condition of the gums in the course of the therapeutic process. Regular use of probiotics during orthodontic treatment significantly reduces the number of bacteria from the Streptococcus mutans group in the patient's saliva and significantly inhibits the expression of inflammatory mediators and an excessive immune response. The main mechanisms of the action of probiotics, such as elimination and inhibition of the growth of pathogenic microorganisms through competition for receptor sites and the secretion of metabolites with antibacterial activity, as well as the stimulation of specific and non-specific immune responses by activating T lymphocytes, and stimulating the production of cytokines, make it possible to also effectively use pro-health bacteria in oral diseases.",1426-3912 (Print) 1426-3912 (Linking),2021,,"['10.5114/ceji.2021.104412 [doi]', '43505 [pii]']",['eng'],Poland,"['oral diseases', 'probiotics', 'therapy']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Termedia.'],,

Therefore, this study aimed to quantify BPA present as an impurity in both BPA-based and non-BPA-based monomers and to evaluate whether these monomers may degrade to BPA upon salivary, bacterial, and chemical challenges. METHODS: BPA was determined in three different amounts (1, 2, and 3 mumol) of each monomer (TEGDMA, UDMA, mUDMA, BisGMA, BisEMA-3, -6, -10, -30, BisPMA, EBPADMA urethane, BADGE, and BisDMA). Next, the monomers (3 mumol) were immersed in whole human pooled saliva collected from adults, Streptococcus mutans (2 x 10(7) CFU/mL), and acidic (0.1 M HCl), alkaline (0.1 M NaOH), and control media. The amount of BPA was quantified using a specific and highly sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method including derivatization of BPA by pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride. RESULTS: The monomers BisGMA and BisEMA-3 contained trace amounts (0.0006% and 0.0025%, respectively) of BPA as impurities of their synthesis process. BPA concentrations increased when the monomers BisGMA, BisEMA-3, BisEMA-6, BisEMA-10, BisPMA and BADGE were exposed to saliva and S. mutans, indicating degradation of a small amount of monomer into BPA. In addition, BisPMA and BADGE degraded into BPA under alkaline conditions. The conversion rate of the monomers into BPA ranged between 0.0003% and 0.0025%. SIGNIFICANCE: Impurities and degradation of BPA-based monomers may account for the release of BPA from resin-based dental materials. Even though the detected amounts of BPA due to monomer impurity were small, manufacturers of dental materials can reduce the BPA content by using only monomers of the highest purity. Considering the overall current trend towards BPA-free materials, it may be recommendable to investigate whether non-BPA based monomers can be used in dental resin-based materials.",1879-0097 (Electronic) 0109-5641 (Linking),2021 Apr 22,,"['S0109-5641(21)00108-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.dental.2021.03.005 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['Bisphenol A', 'Degradation', 'Dental monomer', 'Impurity']","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Academy of Dental Materials.

The present study investigated the efficacy of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NP) varnish to inhibit S. mutans growth, biofilm, acid production, and its antioxidant potential and cytotoxicity. DESIGN: Green synthesized ZnO-NP were characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Secondary metabolites were assessed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Anti-oxidant potential was ascertained using 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DDPH) assay and cytotoxicity of synthesized nanoparticles was evaluated on human liver cancer (Hep G2) and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293T) cell lines. RESULTS: Synthesized ZnO-NP showed excellent antimicrobial properties against S. mutans, as the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations were 0.53 mug/mL, and 1.3 mug/mL respectively. ZnO-NP at 0.1 mg/mul concentration had the greatest zone of inhibition (24 mm), followed by 0.05 mg/mul ZnO-NP (23 mm) and 0.05 mg/mul ampicillin (21 mm). Further, 0.1 mg/mul ZnO-NP varnish inhibited 90 % of S. mutans biofilms and reduced 24 h acid production closest to that of baseline and it also exhibited antioxidant capacity in a dose dependent manner (94 % inhibition-100 mug/mL). Biocompatibility of ZnO-NP varnish was evaluated on Hep G2 and HEK-293T cell lines; and the highest concentration of 0.1 mg/mul ZnO-NP used caused very low cytotoxicity to Hep G2 cells and was non-cytotoxic to HEK-293T cells.

Bacterial accumulation and dental demineralization lead to destruction of bonding interface, thus limiting the longevity of composite. The present study investigated remineralization effectiveness of adhesive containing nanoparticles of amorphous calcium phosphate (NACP) in a stimulated oral biofilm environment. METHODS: The enamel blocks were immersed in demineralization solution for 72 h to imitate artificial initial carious lesion and then subjected to a Streptococcus mutans biofilm for 24 h. All the samples then underwent 4-h demineralization in brain heart infusion broth with sucrose (BHIS) and 20-h remineralization in artificial saliva (AS) for 7 days. The daily pH of BHIS after 4-h incubation, lactic acid production, colony-forming unit (CFU) count, and content of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) in biofilm were evaluated. Meanwhile, the remineralization effectiveness of enamel was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface microhardness testing, transverse microradiography (TMR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: The NACP adhesive released abundant Ca and P, achieved acid neutralization, reduced lactic acid production, and lowered CFU count (P < 0.05). Enamel treated with NACP adhesive demonstrated the best remineralization effectiveness with remineralization value of 52.29 +/- 4.79% according to TMR. Better microhardness recovery of cross sections and ample mineral deposits were also observed in NACP group.

This resulted in a panel of pathogenic Neisseria (N. gonorrhoeae [n = 5] and N. meningitidis [n = 5]) and nonpathogenic Neisseria (N. subflava [n = 11], N. mucosa [n = 3] and N. oralis [n = 2]). A high proportion of strains in this panel were resistant to azithromycin (18/26) and ceftriaxone (3/26). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of these strains identified numerous mutations that are known to confer reduced susceptibility to azithromycin and ceftriaxone in N. gonorrhoeae. The presence or absence of these known mutations did not explain the high level resistance to azithromycin (>256 mg/L) in the nonpathogenic isolates (8/16). After screening for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, we found a ribosomal protection protein, Msr(D), in these highly azithromycin resistant nonpathogenic strains. The complete integration site originated from Streptococcus pneumoniae and is associated with high level resistance to azithromycin in many other bacterial species. This novel AMR resistance mechanism to azithromycin in nonpathogenic Neisseria could be a public health concern if it were to be transmitted to pathogenic Neisseria.

Mechanical biofilm removal as well as the use of adjuvant antiseptics supports the prevention of pathogenic biofilm formation. Recently, the antibacterial effect of the oral care product REPHA-OS((R)), based on medicinal plant extracts and essential oils, has been demonstrated on oral pathogens grown on agar plates. In the present study, the effectiveness of the product on medical relevant oral biofilm development should be demonstrated for the first time. METHODS: An established in vitro oral multispecies biofilm, composed of Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar and Porphyromonas gingivalis, was used to analyze the antibacterial effect of different REPHA-OS((R)) concentrations on planktonic bacteria, biofilm formation and mature biofilms. It was quantified using metabolic activity assays and live/dead fluorescence staining combined with three-dimensional confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Additionally, effects on species distribution inside the biofilm were assessed by means of quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: REPHA-OS((R)) showed statistically significant antimicrobial effects on all stages of biofilm development: a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5% could be detected for both, for planktonic bacteria and for biofilm formation. Interestingly, only a slightly higher concentration of 10% was necessary to completely kill all bacteria in mature biofilms also. In contrast, an influence on the biofilm matrix or the species distribution could not be observed. The effect could be attributed to the herbal ingredients, not to the contained ethanol.

Adjunctive to mechanical treatment of periodontitis and as alternatives to antibiotics, the use of probiotic bacteria was suggested. In this study, the inhibitory effect of the probiotic Streptococcus salivarius subsp. salivarius strains M18 and K12, Streptococcus oralis subsp. dentisani 7746, and Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 5289 on anaerobic periodontal bacteria and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was tested. Rarely included in other studies, we also quantified the inverse effect of pathogens on probiotic growth. Probiotics and periodontal pathogens were co-incubated anaerobically in a mixture of autoclaved saliva and brain heart infusion broth. The resulting genome numbers of the pathogens and of the probiotics were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Mixtures of the streptococcal probiotics were also used to determine their synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects. The overall best inhibitor of the periodontal pathogens was L. reuteri ATCC PTA 5289, but the effect is coenzyme B12-, anaerobiosis-, as well as glycerol-dependent, and further modulated by L. reuteri strain DSM 17938. Notably, in absence of glycerol, the pathogen-inhibitory effect could even turn into a growth spurt. Among the streptococci tested, S. salivarius M18 had the most constant inhibitory potential against all pathogens, followed by K12 and S. dentisani 7746, with the latter still having significant inhibitory effects on P. intermedia and A. actinomycetemcomitans. Overall, mixtures of the streptococcal probiotics did inhibit the growth of the pathogens equally or-in the case of A. actinomycetemcomitans- better than the individual strains. P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were best inhibited by pure cultures of S. salivarius K12 or S. salivarius M18, respectively. Testing inverse effects, the growth of S. salivarius M18 was enhanced when incubated with the periodontal pathogens minus/plus other probiotics.

Importantly, although ADEP-activated ClpP is assumed to target multiple polypeptide and protein substrates in the bacterial cell, not all proteins seem equally susceptible. In Bacillus subtilis, the cell division protein FtsZ emerged to be particularly sensitive to degradation by ADEP-activated ClpP at low inhibitory ADEP concentrations. In fact, FtsZ is the only bacterial protein that has been confirmed to be degraded in vitro as well as within bacterial cells so far. However, the molecular reason for this preferred degradation remained elusive. Here, we report the unexpected finding that ADEP-activated ClpP alone, in the absence of any Clp-ATPase, leads to an unfolding and subsequent degradation of the N-terminal domain of FtsZ, which can be prevented by the stabilization of the FtsZ fold via nucleotide binding. At elevated antibiotic concentrations, importantly, the C terminus of FtsZ is notably targeted for degradation in addition to the N terminus. Our results show that different target structures are more or less accessible to ClpP, depending on the ADEP level present. Moreover, our data assign a Clp-ATPase-independent protein unfolding capability to the ClpP core of the bacterial Clp protease and suggest that the protein fold of FtsZ may be more flexible than previously anticipated.IMPORTANCE Acyldepsipeptide (ADEP) antibiotics effectively kill multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The antibacterial activity of ADEP depends on a new mechanism of action, i.e., the deregulation of bacterial protease ClpP that leads to bacterial self-digestion. Our data allow new insights into the mode of ADEP action by providing a molecular explanation for the distinct bacterial phenotypes observed at low versus high ADEP concentrations. In addition, we show that ClpP alone, in the absence of any unfoldase or energy-consuming system, and only activated by the small molecule antibiotic ADEP, leads to the unfolding of the cell division protein FtsZ.",2150-7511 (Electronic),2020 Jun 30,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4477-2382'],"['mBio.01006-20 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.01006-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['*ADEP', '*Clp protease', '*Clp-ATPases', '*acyldepsipeptides', '*antibiotics', '*cytokinesis', '*guanosine nucleotides', '*protein unfolding']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Silber et al.'],"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (FtsZ protein, Bacteria)', 'EC 3.4.21.92 (Endopeptidase Clp)']","['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacillus subtilis/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Depsipeptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Endopeptidase Clp/*metabolism', 'Protein Unfolding/*drug effects']"

The microbiological results of a phase 3 clinical trial in adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) comparing delafloxacin (300 mg intravenously [i.v.] with the option to switch to 450 mg orally every 12 h) to moxifloxacin (400 mg i.v. with the option to switch to 400 mg orally once a day [QD]) were determined. Patients from 4 continents, predominately Europe but also South America and Asia, were enrolled. The microbiological intent-to-treat (MITT) population included 520 patients, and 60.5% of these patients had a bacterial pathogen identified. Multiple diagnostic methods were employed, including culture, serology, PCR, and urinary antigen tests. Based on baseline MIC90 values, delafloxacin exhibited at least 16-fold greater activity than moxifloxacin for Gram-positive and fastidious Gram-negative pathogens. Delafloxacin retained activity against resistant phenotypes found in Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-, macrolide-, and multiple-drug resistant), Haemophilus species (beta-lactamase producing and macrolide nonsusceptible), and S. aureus (MRSA and fluoroquinolone-nonsusceptible methicillin-susceptible S. aureus [MSSA]).

METHODS: A before-after study was conducted to compare the data for 1 year before and after intervention at a Japanese university hospital. Educational intervention included lectures for all medical staff on oral antibiotics and educational meetings with each medical department. The primary outcome was the use of oral third-generation cephalosporins in inpatients as measured by the monthly median days of therapy (DOTs) per 1000 patient days. Secondary outcomes included the use of each oral antibiotic in inpatients and outpatients, proportion of beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (BLNAR), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC), the incidence of hospital-acquired Clostridioides difficile infection (HA-CDI), and hospital mortality. RESULTS: The use of oral third-generation cephalosporins in inpatients was significantly decreased after intervention [DOTs (interquartile range): 24.2 (23.5-25.1) vs. 3.7 (0.0-7.1), P < 0.001], and the value in outpatients was also decreased significantly.

Antimicrobial resistance has weakened the effectiveness of many medicines widely used today. Thus, discovering new antibacterial drugs is paramount in the effort to treat emerging drug-resistant bacteria. METHODS: Eravacycline, tigecycline and other clinical routine antibiotics were tested by reference broth micro-dilution method against 336 different strains collected from 11 teaching hospitals in China between 2012 and 2016. These isolates included Enterobacteriaceae, non-fermentative, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus, and a number of fastidious organisms. The strains involved in this study possess the most important drug resistance characteristics currently known in China. Drug resistant bacteria such as those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases (KPC-2 and NDM-1), and those exhibiting colistin resistance (mcr-1) and tigecycline were included in this study. Additionally, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae, and penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were also included. RESULTS: Eravacycline exhibited good efficacy against all the strains tested, especially for organisms with ESBLs, carbapenemases, and mcr-1 gene compared with tigecycline and other antibiotics tested. The MIC values of eravacycline against carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae and OXA-23-producing A. baumannii were much lower than the MIC values of other antibiotics. MRSA, VRE, beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenza, and PRSP were sensitive to eravacycline in every strain tested. Furthermore, in most strains tested, the MICs of eravacycline were two to four-fold lower than the MICs of tigecycline. CONCLUSIONS: Eravacycline has shown potent antibacterial activity against common and clinically important antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The MIC distribution of eravacycline was generally lower than that of tigecycline which demonstrates that this new drug is potentially more effective than the existing medications.",1471-2334 (Electronic) 1471-2334 (Linking),2019 Jun 10,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9010-4994'],"['10.1186/s12879-019-4093-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-019-4093-1 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Antibiotic resistance', 'Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteria', 'Eravacycline', 'Tigecycline']",,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Tetracyclines)', '07896928ZC (eravacycline)', 'EC 3.5.2.- (beta-lactamase OXA-23)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (carbapenemase)']","['Acinetobacter baumannii/drug effects/enzymology/*isolation & purification', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'China', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Enterobacteriaceae/drug effects/enzymology/*isolation & purification', 'Hospitals, Teaching', 'Humans', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Tetracyclines/*pharmacology', 'beta-Lactamases/metabolism']"

Our aim was to analyze the clinical characteristics, microbiological results, laboratory data, therapies, and outcome of patients with NSTIs admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A monocentric observational study of patients admitted to the ICU of a university hospital between January 2009 and December 2017. The demographic characteristics, comorbidities, clinical features, microbiology and laboratory results, organ dysfunctions, therapies, and outcome were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 59 patients and 70% males. The mean age (+/- SD) was 55 +/- 18; type II (monomicrobial) NSTI was present in 36 patients (61%); the most common isolated pathogen was Streptococcus pyogenes in 28 patients (48%). Septic shock was diagnosed in 41 patients (70%). The most common organ dysfunctions were circulatory and renal in 42 (71%) and 38 patients (64%). The mean value (+/- SD) of serum lactate at admission to the ICU was 4.22 +/- 5.42 mmol/l, the median SOFA score and SAPS II were 7 (IQR 4 - 10) and 46 (IQR 30.5 - 53). ICU mortality rate was 25%. Both SOFA score and serum lactate demonstrated a good prognostic value regarding ICU outcome (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.07-1.57, P < 0.007 and OR 1.53, 95%CI 1.19-1.98, P < 0.001). A cut-off value for serum lactate of 6.55 mmol/L positively predicted mortality with 67% sensitivity and 97% specificity. CONCLUSION: NSTIs carry a high risk of septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and thus are still associated with high mortality. In our study, the value of serum lactate at admission to the ICU correlated well with mortality. This easy-to-measure parameter could play a role in the decision-making process regarding prognosis and continuation of care.",1525-1489 (Electronic) 0885-0666 (Linking),2021 Apr 26,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8934-9772'],['10.1177/08850666211010127 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['intensive care', 'lactate', 'necrotizing soft tissue infection', 'sepsis']",,,

Our knowledge of S. sobrinus is scant despite the organism's important role in oral health. It is widely believed that S. sobrinus lacks the natural competence pathways that are used by other streptococci to regulate growth, virulence, and quorum sensing. The lack of natural competence has also prevented genetic manipulation of S. sobrinus, limiting our knowledge of its pathogenicity. We discovered that most strains of S. sobrinus contain a new class of the ComRS competence system. Although S. sobrinus is typically placed among the mutans group streptococci, the S. sobrinus ComRS system is most similar to the competence pathways in the salivarius group. Unlike all other ComRS systems, the S. sobrinus pathway contains 2 copies of the transcriptional regulator ComR and has a peptide pheromone (XIP) that lacks any aromatic amino acids. Synthetic XIP enables transformation of S. sobrinus with plasmid or linear DNA, and we leverage this newfound genetic tractability to confirm that only 1 of the ComR homologs is required for induced competence while the other appears to suppress competence. Exogenous XIP increases the expression of bacteriocin gene clusters and produces an antimicrobial response that inhibits growth of S. mutans. We also identified 2 strains of S. sobrinus that appear to be ""cheaters"" by either not responding to or not producing XIP. We show how a recombination event in the nonresponsive strain could restore function of the ComRS pathway but delete the gene encoding XIP. Thus, the S. sobrinus ComRS pathway provides new tools for studying this pathogen and offers a lens into the evolution of ecological cheaters.",1544-0591 (Electronic) 0022-0345 (Linking),2021 May,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1257-9836'],['10.1177/0022034520979150 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['*dental caries', '*genetics', '*microbiology', '*pheromones', '*quorum sensing', '*streptococcus']",,['0 (Bacterial Proteins)'],"['Bacterial Proteins/genetics', '*Dental Caries', 'Humans', 'Quorum Sensing', 'Streptococcus', 'Streptococcus mutans/genetics', '*Streptococcus sobrinus/genetics']"

Here we focus on a newly designed family of mesoporous coatings based on zirconia (ZrO2) microstructure doped with gallium (Ga), exploiting its antibacterial and pro-osseo-integrative properties. The ZrO2 films were obtained via sol-gel synthesis route using Pluronic F127 as templating agent, while Ga doping was gained by introducing gallium nitrate hydrate. Chemical characterization by means of XPS and GDOES confirmed the effective incorporation of Ga. Then, coatings morphological and structural analysis were carried out by TEM and SAED unveiling an effective stabilization of both the mesoporous structure and the tetragonal ZrO2 phase. Specimens' cytocompatibility was confirmed towards gingival fibroblast and osteoblasts progenitors cultivated directly onto the coatings showing comparable metabolic activity and morphology in respect to controls cultivated on polystyrene. The presence of Ga significantly reduced the metabolic activity of the adhered oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in comparison to untreated bulk zirconia (p<0.05); on the opposite, Ga ions did not significantly reduce the metabolism of the oral commensal Streptococcus salivarius (p>0.05) thus suggesting for a selective anti-pathogens activity. Finally, the coatings' ability to preserve cells from bacterial infection was proved in a co-culture method where cells and bacteria were cultivated in the same environment: the presence of Ga determined a significant reduction of the bacteria viability while allowing at the same time for cells proliferation. In conclusion, the here developed coatings not only demonstrated to satisfy the requested antibacterial and cytocompatibility properties, but also being promising candidates for the improvement of implantable devices in the field of implant dentistry.",1748-605X (Electronic) 1748-6041 (Linking),2021 Apr 15,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5317-6849'],['10.1088/1748-605X/abf88d [doi]'],['eng'],England,"['Antibacterial dental coatings', 'Antibiofilm', 'Cytocompatible', 'Gallium', 'Mesoporous structures', 'Zirconia']",['(c) 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.'],,

The aim of the study was to develop a plaster/bandage for the application of inhibitory substances produced by these probiotics when applied to diseased skin. For this purpose, two Streptococcus salivarius strains and one Lactobacillus plantarum were tested for production of antimicrobials (bacteriocin-like substances) active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens using established methods. A newly designed membrane test ensured that the probiotics produce antimicrobials diffusible through membranes. Target organisms used were Cutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, the L. plantarum 8P-A3 strain was tested against additional bacteria involved in skin disorders. The Lactobacillales used were active against all potential skin pathogens tested. These probiotics could be enclosed between polymer membranes-one tight, the other permeable for their products, preserved by vacuum drying, and reactivated after at least three months storage. Importantly, the reactivated pads containing the probiotics demonstrated antibacterial activity on agar plates against all pathogens tested.

Many pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear, while misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Infectious diseases spread rapidly and pathogens mutate quickly, posing new threats to human health. However, with the increasing use of high-throughput screening of pathogen genomes, research based on big data mining and visualization analysis has gradually become a hot topic for studies of infectious disease prevention and control. In this paper, the framework was performed on four infectious pathogens (Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Streptococcus salivarius) through five functions: 1) genome annotation, 2) phylogeny analysis based on core genome, 3) analysis of structure differences between genomes, 4) prediction of virulence genes/factors with their pathogenic mechanisms, and 5) prediction of resistance genes/factors with their signaling pathways. The experiments were carried out from three angles: phylogeny (macro perspective), structure differences of genomes (micro perspective), and virulence and drug-resistance characteristics (prediction perspective). Therefore, the framework can not only provide evidence to support the rapid identification of new or unknown pathogens and thus plays a role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, but also help to recommend the most appropriate strains for clinical and scientific research.

Current anti-caries agents mainly focus on the bacteriostatic effect in a neutral environment and do not target acid-resistant microorganisms related to caries in acidic milieus. Objectives: To assess the in vitro antibacterial activities of bedaquiline against oral pathogens in acidic milieus. Methods: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus salivarius were used to prepare the mono-/multiple suspension and biofilm. The MIC and IC50 of bedaquiline against S. mutans were determined by the broth microdilution method. Bedaquiline was compared regarding (i) the inhibitory activity in pH 4-7 and at different time points against planktonic and biofilm; (ii) the effect on the production of lactic acid, extracellular polysaccharide, and pH of S. mutans biofilm; (iii) the cytotoxicity effects; and (iv) the activity on H(+)-ATPase enzyme of S. mutans. Results: In pH 5 BHI, 2.5 mg/L (IC50) and 4 mg/L (MIC) of bedaquiline inhibited the proliferation and biofilm generation of S. mutans and Mix in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, but it was invalid in a neutral environment. The lactic acid production, polysaccharide production, and pH drop range reduced with the incorporation of bedaquiline in a pH 5 environment. Its inhibitory effect (>56 mg/L) against H(+)-ATPase enzyme in S. mutans and its non-toxic effect (<10 mg/L) on periodontal ligament stem cells were also confirmed. Conclusion: Bedaquiline is efficient in inhibiting the proliferation and biofilm generation of S. mutans and other oral pathogens in an acidic environment.

RESULTS: Th17 (1.9 and 5.1 fold) and Tc17 (4.0 and 2.0 fold) frequency under mitogenic stimulation was significantly increased in aBD and rBD patients as compared with HC. Th17 frequency under antigenic stimulation was also higher in patients than in HC. The percentage and number of Tregs and activated Tregs in patients and in HC were similar. However, when Tregs were removed, antigen-driven differentiation into Th1 and Th17 was significantly boosted in BD but not in HC CD4+T cells. CONCLUSION: There is a bias toward a Th17 polarization in acute and remitting BD children. Although we did not observe an increase in the number of Tregs in these patients, their Tregs limit CD4+T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells.

There is as yet not one best solution to this problem. Previous studies have established viability assessments using propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment coupled with downstream molecular profiling (e.g., qPCR or sequencing). While these studies have met with moderate success, most of them focused on the resulting ""viable"" communities without systematic evaluations of the technique. Here, we present our work to rigorously benchmark ""PMA-seq"" (PMA treatment followed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) for viability assessment in synthetic and realistic microbial communities. RESULTS: PMA-seq was able to successfully reconstruct simple synthetic communities comprising viable/heat-killed Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sanguinis. However, in realistically complex communities (computer screens, computer mice, soil, and human saliva) with E. coli spike-in controls, PMA-seq did not accurately quantify viability (even relative to variability in amplicon sequencing), with its performance largely affected by community properties such as initial biomass, sample types, and compositional diversity. We then applied this technique to environmental swabs from the Boston subway system. Several taxa differed significantly after PMA treatment, while not all microorganisms responded consistently. To elucidate the ""PMA-responsive"" microbes, we compared our results with previous PMA-based studies and found that PMA responsiveness varied widely when microbes were sourced from different ecosystems but were reproducible within similar environments across studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of PMA-seq exploring its quantitative potential in synthetic and complex microbial communities, where the technique was effective for semi-quantitative purposes in simple synthetic communities but provided only qualitative assessments in realistically complex community samples.

1292,33427222,"['Eick, Sigrun', 'Lussi, Adrian']",Arginine: A Weapon against Cariogenic Biofilm?,"Untreated dental caries is the most prevalent disease worldwide. Development of caries is associated with the intake of sugar. The microorganisms utilize the sugar and create an acidic environment, which results in mineral loss. The appropriate use of fluoride is associated with a decline of caries. Another approach in preventing caries might be the increase of pH in dental plaque. During recent years, arginine has increasingly become the focus of interest. This is based on the fact that certain streptococci possess an arginine deiminase system (ADS) which metabolizes free arginine. In vivo, the incidence of caries was inversely correlated with ADS activity in saliva and dental plaque. ADS is highly active in Streptococcus gordonii and S. sanguinis, but is absent in S. sobrinus and S. mutans. In the presence of 1.5% L-arginine, S. gordonii and S. sanguinis, but not S. mutans and S. sobrinus, synthesize the metabolite citrulline and increase the pH of the environment.In defined multispecies biofilms consisting of ADS-positive and ADS-negative streptococci, supplementation with 1.5% arginine suppressed the growth of ADS-negative by favoring ADS-positive streptococci together with an increase in the pH of the environment. Evaluating the influence of daily manual removal of the biofilm in vitro by brushing with a commercial toothpaste containing fluoride and arginine resulted in less surface microhardness even when compared with a toothpaste with fluoride only.

METHODS: We examined the basic surface properties of moderately to severely fluorotic enamel by surface microhardness test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy. Then S. mutans single-species biofilms and S. mutans - S. sanguinis dual-species biofilms were cultured on fluorotic enamel surface. The morphology of biofilms, the volume of bacteria and expolysaccharides (EPS) and the number of bacteria were respectively tested by SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy and colony-forming units (CFU) counting. RESULTS: Fluorotic enamel displayed lower average microhardness and greater surface roughness than sound enamel, and it also showed structure defects like pores or pits. The biofilm thickness, volume of bacteria and EPS, and CFU counts of bacteria in both single-species and dual-species biofilms on fluorotic enamel were all significantly higher than those on sound enamel. The volume of bacteria and EPS in dual-species biofilms are both less than those of single-species biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: The higher surface roughness and the structure defects of teeth with moderate to severe dental fluorosis contributed to the adhesion of S. mutans and S. sanguinis, and the increased adhesion of S. mutans may increase the susceptibility of dental caries. However, S. sanguinis would play a role as a ""designer bacteria"" which reduce the cariogenicity of the biofilms on fluorotic enamel surface.",1879-1506 (Electronic) 0003-9969 (Linking),2021 Jan,,"['S0003-9969(20)30348-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.archoralbio.2020.104970 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['Adhesion', 'Dental caries', 'Dental fluorosis', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Streptococcus sanguinis', 'Surface properties']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies reported that BGA has antibacterial effects against several bacteria. In this study, we evaluated the effects of BGA on the regulation of supragingival plaque bacteria. First, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of BGA against oral bacteria were measured. Next, minimum concentrations for inhibition of biofilm formation were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, possessing insoluble glucan synthesis abilities. MICs of biofilm formation by these bacteria ranged from 1/8 to 2x MIC. Furthermore, the inhibition effects of BGA against the coaggregation of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii were evaluated. BGA at 32 or 64 mug/mL inhibited the coaggregation of these bacteria after a 30-min incubation. Lastly, the inhibition effects of BGA against human supragingival plaque bacteria were evaluated. Human supragingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 healthy donors. The inhibition effects of BGA against biofilm formation by these plaque bacteria were evaluated. Of 12 samples, the biofilm formation by eleven was significantly attenuated by 128 to 256 mug/mL of BGA. The number of colony forming units in these biofilms was also significantly attenuated. In conclusion, we revealed that BGA inhibits the growth and biofilm formation of bacteria, furthermore, the same effect was confirmed with supragingival plaque bacteria. BGA is one of a good candidate for a natural agent that prevents the outbreak and progression of periodontal disease because it suppresses not only the growth and biofilm formation of bacteria, but also the coaggregation of P. gingivalis with plaque bacteria.

Lactobacillus spp. have been studied and used as probiotics globally, but due to difficulties with laboratory cultivation and experimentation with oral microorganisms, there are few studies on Lactobacillus spp. isolated from the oral cavity being used against oral pathogens. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biosafety and inhibitory effects of Lactobacillus fermentum OK as a potential oral biotherapeutic probiotic against oral pathogens. L. fermentum OK was evaluated based on microbial and genetic characteristics. A 5% dilution of L. fermentum OK culture supernatant showed that 60% inhibition against the growth of S. mutans and L. fermentum OK displayed significant inhibitory effects against the growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguinis. However, proliferation of L. fermentum OK, when co-cultured with harmful oral bacteria, was retarded. L. fermentum OK was shown to produce 1130 mumol/L hydrogen peroxide, aggregate efficiently with Streptococcus sobrinus, S. gordonii, S. mutans, S. sanguinis, and P. gingivalis, and reduce S. mutans that produced artificial dental plaque by 97.9%. The in vitro cell adhesion capacity of L. fermentum OK to an oral epithelial cell line was 3.1 cells per cell and the cell adhesion of F. nucleatum and S. mutans decreased strongly in protection and displacement assays. L. fermentum OK was evaluated for safety using ammonia production, biogenic amine production, hemolytic property, mucin degradation testing, antibiotic susceptibility, and whole genome sequencing (WGS).

The beta-AgVO3 incorporation did not alter the porcelain's components, reduced the S. mutans, S. sobrinus and A. actinomycetemcomitans viability, increased the fracture toughness of IPS Inline, the roughness for all groups, and did not affect the microhardness of the 5% group. Among all groups, IPS Inline 5% released more Ag(+), and Ex-3 Noritake 2.5% released more V(4+)/V(5+). It was concluded that the incorporation of beta-AgVO3 into dental porcelains promoted antimicrobial activity against S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and A. actinomycetemcomitans (preventing biofilm formation), caused a higher release of vanadium than silver ions, and an adequate mechanical behavior was observed.

The experiment was a completely randomized design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments and four replicates per treatment. A basal diet [10% barley silage, 87% dry-rolled barley grain, and 3% vitamin and mineral supplement, dry matter (DM) basis] and a DDGS diet (as per basal diet with 25% of wheat DDGS replacing an equal portion of barley grain) were supplemented with ROD extract at 0 and 1% (DM basis), respectively. The experimental period was 17 d, consisting 10 days of adaptation and 7 days of data and sample collection. The substitution of wheat DDGS for barley grain did not affect gas production; disappearances of DM, organic matter, and crude protein; total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production; and microbial protein production. However, replacing barley grain with wheat DDGS increased (P = 0.01) fermenter pH and molar proportion of branched-chain VFA, switched (P = 0.06) the fermentation pattern to higher acetate production due to increased (P = 0.01) disappearance of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and decreased (P = 0.08) methane (CH4) production. In the basal barley diet, the ROD extract increased the acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio (P = 0.08) and reduced the disappearance of starch (P = 0.06) with no effect on any other variables. No effects of ROD in the DDGS diet were observed. The number of operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) and the Shannon diversity index of the microbial community had little variation among treatments. Taxonomic analysis revealed no effect of adding the ROD extract on the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level with either the basal diet or DDGS diet, while at the genus level, the microbial community was affected by the addition of both DDGS and the ROD extract. Prevotella and Fibrobacter were the most abundant genera in the basal diet; however, Treponema became the most abundant genus with the addition of the ROD extract. These results indicated that the substitution of wheat DDGS for barley grain may mitigate enteric CH4 emissions. The trend of reduced starch fermentability and increased NDF disappearance with the addition of ROD extract suggests a reduced risk of rumen acidosis and an improvement in the utilization of fiber for cattle-fed high-grain diet.",2297-1769 (Print) 2297-1769 (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fvets.2021.644738 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['DDGS', 'RUSITEC', 'fermentation pattern', 'high grain diet', 'red osier dogwood extract']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Gomaa, Saleem, Ran, Jin, Samir, McGeough, Ominski, Chen and', 'Yang.']",,

We aimed to determine the frequency of T pallidum shedding from potentially asymptomatic sites and the stage of infection at which shedding is most frequent in men who have sex with men (MSM), who have been disproportionately affected by syphilis. METHODS: We did a prospective, cross-sectional study in MSM recruited from Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (Melbourne, VIC, Australia). Men were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, reported sex with men during the past 12 months, and had laboratory confirmed primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, consistent with Australian definitions. Primary and secondary syphilis lesions were swabbed and non-lesion samples were collected via oral rinse, oral cavity swab, anal canal swab, urine, and semen. Samples were tested for T pallidum using PCR assays targeting polA (lesion and non-lesion samples) and 47 kDa (non-lesion samples only) gene targets. The primary outcome was the proportion of men with T pallidum detected from potentially asymptomatic sites-namely, the mouth, anus, urethra, and semen. FINDINGS: Between Nov 30, 2015, and May 23, 2019, 246 MSM were screened for inclusion, of whom 200 had serologically confirmed early syphilis and were included in the study: 54 (27%) of 200 had primary syphilis, 93 (47%) had secondary syphilis, and 53 (27%) had early latent syphilis. T pallidum DNA was detected in 48 (24%; 95% CI 18.3-30.5) of 200 men by oral rinse or oral lesion swab, or both, of whom 24 had no oral lesions. Oral T pallidum detection was most frequent in those with secondary syphilis compared with those at other stages of disease (41 [44%] of 93 vs seven [7%] of 107; p<0.0001), and in men with rapid plasma reagin titres of 1/64 or higher compared with those with lower titres (37 [32%] of 117 vs 11 [13%] of 83; p=0.0026). T pallidum was detected by anal canal swab or anal lesion swab, or both, in 45 (23.0%; 95% CI 17.3-29.5) of 196 men with available samples, of whom ten had no anal lesion. Furthermore, T pallidum was detected in urine samples of 12 (6.1%, 3.2-10.3) of 198 men and in semen samples from six (12.0%, 4.5-24.3) of 50 men who provided samples. Among the 93 men with secondary syphilis, 69 (74%) had T pallidum detected at any site, and 24 (26%) had detection at two or more separate sites. Among the 54 men with primary syphilis, 49 (91%) had T pallidum detected at any site, and 11 (20%) had detection at two or more separate sites. Among the 53 men with early latent syphilis, four (8%) had T pallidum detected at any site and none had T pallidum detected at two or more separate sites. INTERPRETATION: Unrecognised oral and anal shedding of T pallidum occurs in MSM with early syphilis, most frequently in those with secondary syphilis, suggesting secondary syphilis is the most infectious stage and that earlier detection and treatment of syphilis to prevent progression to the secondary stage might improve syphilis control. Future research is needed to ascertain the contribution of shedding of T pallidum from non-lesion sites to transmission of syphilis.

The Syphilis Interventions Towards Elimination (SITE) model was used to explore the expected impact and cost of alternative syphilis intervention scale-up scenarios. Methods: SITE is a dynamical model of syphilis transmission among adults 15-49 years. Individuals are divided into nine groups based on sexual behaviour and into six stages of infection. The model was calibrated to PNG using data from routine surveillance, bio-behavioural surveys, research studies and program records. Inputs included syphilis prevalence, risk behaviours, intervention coverage and service delivery unit costs. Scenarios compared different interventions (clinical treatment, contact tracing, syphilis screening, and condom promotion) for incidence and cost per infection averted over 2021-2030. Results: Increasing treatment coverage of symptomatic primary/secondary-stage syphilis cases from 25-35% in 2020 to 60% from 2023 onwards reduced estimated incidence over 2021-2030 by 55%, compared to a scenario assuming constant coverage at 2019-2020 levels. The introduction of contact tracing in 2020, assuming 0.4 contacts per symptomatic person treated, reduced incidence over 2021-2030 by 10%. Increasing screening coverage by 20-30 percentage points from the 2019-2020 level reduced incidence over 2021-2030 by 3-16% depending on the target population. Scaling-up clinical, symptom-driven treatment and contact tracing had the lowest cost per infection averted, followed by condom promotion and periodic screening of female sex workers and men who have sex with men. Conclusions: PNG could considerably reduce its syphilis burden by scaling-up clinical treatment and contact tracing alongside targeted behavioural risk reduction interventions.

The gut microbiota plays an essential role in host physiological development and metabolism including fat deposition. However, the association of the gut microbiota with the lipogenic phenotype of ducks remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the cecal microbiota of adult Muscovy ducks and the correlation of the cecal microbiota with fat phenotypes. A total of 200 Muscovy ducks were selected from a population of 5,000 Muscovy ducks to record their abdominal fat weight and collect their cecal contents after being slaughtered and defeathered. The cecal contents were subjective to DNA isolation and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results were sorted according to the percentage of abdominal fat and the top 20% (n = 40) and the bottom 20% (n = 40) were set as the high and low groups, respectively. Our results indicated that in the cecum of Muscovy ducks, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Fusobacteria were the predominant phyla while Bacteroides, Oscillospiraceae_uncultured, Parabacteroides, and Bacteroidales_norank were the top 4 dominant genera. Abdominal fat weight (18.57~138.10 g) and percentage of abdominal fat (1.02~27.12%) were significantly correlated (R (2) = 0.92, P < 0.001). Although the lipogenic phenotypes of ducks had a significant difference (P < 0.05), the alpha-diversities of the high and low groups were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Nevertheless, after random forest analysis, we identified two genera, Treponema and Ruminococcus_torques_group, that were significantly associated with fat deposition in Muscovy ducks. In addition, the abundances of Treponema and Ruminococcus_torques_group gave a significantly negative and positive association with abdominal fat weight, respectively (P < 0.05).

This study describes the intestinal microbiota of four Argentinian higher termite species with different feeding habits: Microcerotermes strunckii (hardwood), Nasutitermes corniger (softwood), Termes riograndensis (soil organic matter/grass) and Cornitermes cumulans (grass) by deep sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA and ITS genes. In addition, we have performed a taxonomic and gut community structure comparison incorporating into the analysis the previously reported microbiomes of additional termite species with varied diets. The bacterial phylum Spirochaetes was dominant in the guts of M. strunckii, N. corniger and C. cumulans, whereas Firmicutes predominated in the T. riograndensis gut microbiome. A single bacterial genus, Treponema (Spirochaetes), was dominant in all termite species, except for T. riograndensis. Both in our own sequenced samples and in the broader comparison, prokaryotic alpha-diversity was higher in the soil/grass feeders than in the wood feeders. Meanwhile, the beta-diversity of prokaryotes and fungi was highly dissimilar among strict wood-feeders, whereas that of soil- and grass-feeders grouped more closely. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the only fungal phyla that could be identified in all gut samples, because of the lack of reference sequences in public databases. In summary, higher microbial diversity was recorded in termites with more versatile feeding sources, providing further evidence that diet, along with other factors (e.g., host taxonomy), influences the microbial community assembly in the termite gut.",2167-8359 (Print) 2167-8359 (Linking),2021,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8059-861X'],"['10.7717/peerj.10959 [doi]', '10959 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,"['Gut microbiota', 'Illumina amplicon sequencing', 'Prokaryotic and fungal diversity', 'Termite species']",['(c) 2021 Vikram et al.'],,

The natural history of untreated syphilis progresses through four distinct stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis. Ocular involvement can occur at any stage of syphilis and any part of the eye can be affected. With the exception of syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis, the diverse manifestations of ocular syphilis have few distinct features that can be used to assist in clinical diagnosis. Therefore, ocular syphilis should always be a part of the differential diagnosis of most, if not all, ocular infectious and inflammatory presentations. Specifically, uveitis presentations, high-risk sexual history, illicit drug use history, treatment failure, prior history of syphilis should prompt further diagnostic workup for ocular syphilis. A presumptive diagnosis of ocular syphilis relies on serological testing, both treponemal and nontreponemal tests. All patients with ocular syphilis should have their cerebrospinal fluids tested for the co-existence of neurosyphilis and their blood tested for human immunodeficiency virus co-infection. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that ocular syphilis be managed according to its treatment guidelines for neurosyphilis, with parenteral aqueous crystalline penicillin G the drug of choice. With the timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment, ocular syphilis is curable. However, delayed diagnosis of ocular syphilis may result in long-term visual impairment. Delayed diagnosis occurs because of its diverse presentations mimicking other ocular diseases, and failure of the clinician to order serological testing. With the recent worldwide resurgence of ocular syphilis, clinicians should be familiar with the manifestation, diagnosis, and treatment of ocular syphilis.",1444-0938 (Electronic) 0816-4622 (Linking),2021 Apr 8,,['10.1080/08164622.2021.1906848 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['Diagnosis', 'management', 'manifestations', 'ocular syphilis', 'resurgence']",,,

In the present study, we investigated whether T. phagedenis strains isolated from PDD produce proteolytic enzyme(s) for disruption of the epithelial cell barrier and have the ability to translocate in polarized normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in vitro. Ten strains of T. phagedenis isolated from lesions did not show proteolytic activity on modified skim milk agar, although a human strain of T. denticola used as a control showed such activity. The integrity of tight junctions was monitored by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER). The TER values after inoculation of the T. phagedenis strains examined did not change during the experimental period; however, apical to basolateral translocation of T. phagedenis was confirmed after 24 hr by microscopy and Treponema-specific PCR. We further confirmed that translocation of T. phagedenis was accelerated by co-inoculation with live T. denticola, but not with heat-killed organisms. Furthermore, tight junction ZO-1 protein was not lost intensity after inoculation with T. phagedenis and the organism was observed in NHEK cells using a florescence microscope.

We extended these observations by assessing the impact of a range of intrinsic factors on serum IgG subclass antibodies to both commensal and pathogenic oral bacteria that would contribute to variations in immune protection or disease susceptibility in periodontitis have not been described. METHODS: Subjects (n = 278) were classified as healthy, gingivitis, or periodontitis and categorized as mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis. Demographic stratification included sex, age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and obesity. Whole formalin-fixed bacteria were used as antigens to detect serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass antibody levels using an ELISA. RESULTS: The greatest differences in variations in IgG subclasses occurred in periodontitis versus health or gingivitis to bacteria considered oral pathogens (eg, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola) with IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 increased by three- to sevenfold with Pg. Differences in subclass levels and distribution were also observed related to disease severity, particularly related to individual subclass responses to Pg. Examination of the overall population showed that females had elevated antibody, reflected by elevated IgG2 amounts/proportions. The older group of subjects demonstrated elevated antibody to multiple oral bacteria, lacking any particular subclass pattern. IgG2 antibody to Aa and Pg was increased in smokers.

Patients (n = 110) who underwent dental examinations in the Department of Periodontology at the Veterans Health Service Medical Center between 2018 and 2019 were included. They were divided into healthy and periodontitis groups. The overall number of bacteria, and those of 18 specific bacteria, were determined via real-time polymerase chain reaction in 92 mouth-rinse samples. Differences between groups were evaluated through logistic regression after adjusting for sex, age, and smoking history. There was a significant difference in the prevalence (healthy vs. periodontitis group) of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (2.9% vs. 13.5%), Treponema denticola (42.9% vs. 69.2%), and Prevotella nigrescens (80% vs. 2.7%). Levels of Treponema denticola, Prevotella nigrescens, and Streptococcus mitis were significantly associated with severe periodontitis. We demonstrated the feasibility of detecting periopathogenic bacteria in mouth-rinse samples obtained from patients with periodontitis.

The second one has an oriC and the par locus from the F plasmid, while the third one has the ori and par locus of the Vibrio tubiashii secondary chromosome. The tripartite-genome cells maintained the rod-shaped form and grew only twice as slowly as their parent, allowing their further genetic engineering. A proportion of these 1-Mb chromosomes were purified as covalently closed supercoiled molecules with a conventional alkaline lysis method and anion exchange columns. Furthermore, the second and third chromosomes could be individually electroporated into competent cells. In contrast, the first split-chromosome was not able to coexist with another chromosome carrying the same origin region.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Spoligotyping was performed with primers designed to allow amplification and sequencing of whole CRISPR-arrays from 23 T. maritimum isolates. Twenty-three completed/draft genomes were also downloaded from the NCBI database and analysed. MLST of Turkish isolates was achieved with a well-established 7-gene scheme. T. maritimum genomes carry a structurally complete but partially defective class II CRISPRcas locus due to known amino acid substitutions in encoded Cas9 proteins. Our spacer identification suggests that the host range of bacteriophage P2559Y and Vibrio phage nt-1 include T. maritimum and that the most recurrent infection recorded by isolates has been with Tenacibaculum phage PTm5. Thirty-eight isolates with this CRISPRcas locus belonged to 25 spoligotypes and to 24 sequence types by MLST, respectively.

In this study, the dynamic changes of flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) pIgR (fpIgR) and pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA expression in mucosal tissues were first analyzed post inactivated Vibrio anguillarum immunization, and increased production of TNF-alpha was found to correlate with increased expression of fpIgR. To determine that cytokine TNF-alpha influenced fpIgR expression, following confirming that natural fpIgR expressed on flounder gill (FG) cells, FG cells were incubated with various concentrations of recombinant TNF-alpha for different time, the results showed that the expressions of fpIgR were significantly upregulated at gene and protein levels in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, and similar change trend was observed for free secretory component (SC) secreted by fpIgR into the culture supernatant. After FG cells were treated with TNF-alpha, specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) inhibitor Bay11-7082, and the mixtures of TNF-alpha and wortmannin / Bay11-7082 respectively, the fpIgR protein and mRNA levels, together with SC secretion, obviously decreased in wortmannin- and Bay11-7082-treated cells compared with the untreated control, and cotreatment with wortmannin / Bay11-7082 plus TNF-alpha resulted in lower expression compared with that upon treatment with TNF-alpha alone, indicating that the inhibition of PI3K and NF-kappaB both blocked the ability of TNF-alpha to increase cellular fpIgR and SC levels. Furthermore, the gene expressions of PI3K and NF-kappaB were upregulated and present a tendency to increase first and then decrease after TNF-alpha treatment of FG cells; However, the expression of PI3K mRNA was inhibited significantly by wortmannin but not by Bay11-7082, and the expression of NF-kappaB mRNA was suppressed obviously by Bay11-7082 but not by wortmannin, suggesting that inhibition of PI3K or NF-kappaB had no influence on each other. All these results collectively revealed that TNF-alpha could transcriptionally upregulate fpIgR expression and SC production, and this TNF-alpha-induced pIgR expression was regulated by complex mechanisms that involved PI3K and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, which provided evidences for pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha acting as a regulator in pIgR expression and better understanding of regulation mechanism of pIgR expression in teleost fish.",1872-9142 (Electronic) 0161-5890 (Linking),2021 Apr 23,,"['S0161-5890(21)00128-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2021.04.011 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['Flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) gill (FG) cells', 'Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)', 'Regulation mechanism', 'Signaling pathway', 'Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In Vibrio cholerae, the QS system consists of a LuxR-type receptor VqmA (VqmAVc) and an autoinducer molecule 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol (DPO). A VqmA homolog encoded by vibriophage VP882 (VqmAPhage) can intervene the host QS system via binding to both the host-produced DPO and its cognate promoter (Pqtip) to induce the phage lysogeny-to-lysis transition, whereas VqmAVc cannot influence the VqmAPhage-induced pathway, suggesting an asymmetry regulation. In this study, we report the crystal structure of VqmAPhage-DPO complex at 2.65 A and reveal that the mechanism of DPO recognition is conserved in VqmA homologs. Besides, we identify a non-classical palindrome sequence in Pqtip, which can be effectively recognized by VqmAPhage but not VqmAVc. The sequence contains an interval longer than that in the vqmR promoter recognized by VqmAVc. In addition, the two DBD regions in the VqmAPhage dimer exhibit more relaxed architecture than that of the reported VqmAVc, which is likely to be in the conformation that may easily bind to target promoter containing a longer interval.

In the past several years, many effectors of T6SS were identified in different bacterial species and their involvement in inter-bacterial interactions were described. However, possible defence mechanisms against T6SS attack among prey bacteria were not well clarified yet. METHODS: Escherichia coli was assessed for susceptibility to T6SS-mediated killing by Vibrio cholerae. TheT6SS-mediated bacterial killing assays were performed in absence or presence of different protease inhibitors and with different mutant E. coli strains. Expression levels of selected proteins were monitored using SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses. RESULTS: The T6SS-mediated killing of E. coli by V. cholerae was partly blocked when the serine protease inhibitor Pefabloc was present. E. coli lacking the periplasmic protease inhibitor Ecotin showed enhanced susceptibility to killing by V. cholerae. Mutations affecting E. coli membrane stability also caused increased susceptibility to killing by V. cholerae. E. coli lacking the maltodextrin porin protein LamB showed reduced susceptibility to killing by V. cholerae whereas E. coli with induced high levels of LamB showed reduced survival in inter-bacterial competition. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified two proteins in E. coli, the intrinsic protease inhibitor Ecotin and the outer membrane porin LamB, that influenced E. coli susceptibility to T6SS-mediated killing by V. cholerae.

Clinical disease and current oral cholera vaccines generate antibody responses associated with protection. Immunity is thought to be largely mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific antibodies, primarily targeting the O-antigen. However, the properties and protective mechanism of functionally relevant antibodies have not been well defined. We previously reported on the early B cell response to cholera in a cohort of Bangladeshi patients, from which we characterized a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) isolated from acutely induced plasmablasts. All antibodies in that previous study were expressed in an IgG1 backbone irrespective of their original isotype. To clearly determine the impact of affinity, immunoglobulin isotype and subclass on the functional properties of these MAbs, we re-engineered a subset of low- and high-affinity antibodies in different isotype and subclass immunoglobulin backbones and characterized the impact of these changes on binding, vibriocidal, agglutination, and motility inhibition activity. While the high-affinity antibodies bound similarly to O-antigen, irrespective of isotype, the low-affinity antibodies displayed significant avidity differences. Interestingly, despite exhibiting lower binding properties, variants derived from the low-affinity MAbs had comparable agglutination and motility inhibition properties to the potently binding antibodies, suggesting that how the MAb binds to the O-antigen may be critical to function. In addition, not only pentameric IgM and dimeric IgA, but also monomeric IgA, was remarkably more potent than their IgG counterparts at inhibiting motility. Finally, analyzing highly purified F(ab) versions of these antibodies, we show that LPS cross-linking is essential for motility inhibition.IMPORTANCE Immunity to the severe diarrheal disease cholera is largely mediated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific antibodies.

Some of these stools also contained ICP2-resistant isogenic V. cholerae strains harboring missense mutations in the trimeric outer membrane porin protein OmpU, identifying it as the ICP2 receptor. In this study, we identify the ICP2 proteins that mediate interactions with OmpU by selecting for ICP2 host-range mutants within infant rabbits infected with a mixture of wild type and OmpU mutant strains. ICP2 host-range mutants, that can now infect OmpU mutant strains, had missense mutations in putative tail fiber gene gp25 and putative adhesin gp23 Using site-specific mutagenesis we show that single or double mutations in gp25 are sufficient to generate the host-range mutant phenotype. However, at least one additional mutation in gp23 is required for robust plaque formation on specific OmpU mutants. Mutations in gp23 alone were insufficient to give a host-range mutant phenotype. All ICP2 host-range mutants retained the ability to plaque on wild type V. cholerae cells. The strength of binding of host-range mutants to V. cholerae correlated with plaque morphology, indicating that the selected mutations in gp25 and gp23 restore molecular interactions with the receptor. We propose that ICP2 host-range mutants evolve by a two-step process where, first, gp25 mutations are selected for their broad host-range, albeit accompanied by low level phage adsorption. Subsequent selection occurs for gp23 mutations that further increase productive binding to specific OmpU alleles, allowing for near wild type efficiencies of adsorption and subsequent phage multiplication.ImportanceConcern over multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, including Vibrio cholerae, has led to a renewed interest in phage biology and their potential for phage therapy. ICP2 is a genetically unique virulent phage isolated from cholera patient stool samples. It is also one of three phages in a prophylactic cocktail shown to be effective in animal models of infection and the only one of the three that requires a protein receptor (OmpU). This study identifies an ICP2 tail fiber and a receptor binding protein and examines how ICP2 responds to the selective pressures of phage-resistant OmpU mutants.

In this study, we discovered a hypothetical protein, VP0610 that negatively regulates biofilm formation in Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and we found that the loss of vp0610 typically results in pleiotropic phenotypes that contribute toward promoting biofilm formation, including significantly increased insoluble exopolysaccharide production and swimming motility, decreased soluble exopolysaccharide production, and decreased bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate production. Pull-down assays revealed that VP0610 can interact with 180 proteins, some of which (Hfq, VP0710, VP0793, and CyaA) participate in biofilm formation.

To determine the function of the vscF gene, we constructed the vscF deletion mutant DeltavscF and complementation strain CDeltavscF. Compared with those of wild-type POR-1 and CDeltavscF, the cytotoxic, adherent, and apoptotic abilities of DeltavscF in HeLa cells were significantly reduced (P < 0.01). Furthermore, in infected HeLa cells, the mutant strain reduced the translocation rates of VP1683 and VP1686 effectors compared to the wild-type and complementation strains. A BLAST search showed that vscF is homologous to the MixH needle protein of Shigella flexneri, indicating that the vscF gene encodes the needle protein of T3SS1 in V. parahaemolyticus. Additional translocation assays showed that VPA0226 translocated into the HeLa eukaryotic cytoplasm via T3SS1, secretion assays showed that VPA0226 can be secreted to supernatant by T3SS1, indicating that VPA0226 belongs to the unpublished class of T3SS1 effectors. In conclusion, our data indicate an essential role of vscF in V. parahaemolyticus T3SS1 and revealed that VPA0226 can be secreted into the host cell cytoplasm via T3SS1.

There are several PCD's types, depending on the molecular mechanisms, such as non-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory. Hemocytes are the main component of cellular immunity in bivalve mollusks. Numerous infectious microorganisms produce toxins that impair hemocytes functions, but there is little knowledge on the role of PCD in these cells. This study aims to evaluate in vitro whether marine toxins induce a particular type of PCD in hemocytes of the bivalve mollusk Crassostrea gigas during 4 h at 25 degrees C. Hemocytes were incubated with two types of marine toxins: non-proteinaceous toxins from microalgae (saxitoxin, STX; gonyautoxins 2 and 3, GTX2/3; okadaic acid/dynophysistoxin-1, OA/DTX-1; brevetoxins 2 and 3, PbTx-2,-3; brevetoxin 2, PbTx-2), and proteinaceous extracts from bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vp; V. campbellii, Vc). Also, we used the apoptosis inducers, staurosporine (STP), and camptothecin (CPT). STP, CPT, STX, and GTX 2/3, provoked high hemocyte mortality characterized by apoptosis hallmarks such as phosphatidylserine translocation into the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, exacerbated chromatin condensation, DNA oligonucleosomal fragments, and variation in gene expression levels of apoptotic caspases 2, 3, 7, and 8. The mixture of PbTx-2,-3 also showed many apoptosis features; however, they did not show apoptotic DNA oligonucleosomal fragments. Likewise, PbTx-2, OA/DTX-1, and proteinaceous extracts from bacteria Vp, and Vc, induced a minor degree of cell death with high gene expression of the pro-inflammatory initiator caspase-1, which could indicate a process of pyroptosis-like PCD. Hemocytes could carry out both PCD types simultaneously. Therefore, marine toxins trigger PCD's signaling pathways in C. gigas hemocytes, depending on the toxin's nature, which appears to be highly conserved both structurally and functionally.",1664-3224 (Electronic) 1664-3224 (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fimmu.2021.634497 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Crassostrea gigas', 'apoptosis', 'bivalve mollusk', 'marine toxins', 'programmed cell death', 'pyroptosis-like']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Estrada, Nunez-Vazquez, Palacios, Ascencio, Guzman-Villanueva', 'and Contreras.']",,

These transitions are regulated by sensory modules and regulatory networks that involve the second messenger cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). In this work, we show that a previously uncharacterized c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase (VP1881) from V. parahaemolyticus plays an important role in modulating the c-di-GMP pool. We found that the product of VP1881 promotes its own expression when the levels of c-di-GMP are low or when the phosphodiesterase is catalytically inactive. This behavior has been observed in a class of c-di-GMP receptors called Trigger phosphodiesterases, hence we named the product of VP1881 TpdA, for Trigger phosphodiesterase A. The absence of tpdA showed a negative effect on swimming motility while its overexpression from an IPTG inducible promoter showed a positive effect on both swimming and swarming motility, and a negative effect on biofilm formation. Changes in TpdA abundance altered the expression of representative polar and lateral flagellar genes as well as the biofilm related gene cpsA Our results also revealed that autoactivation of the native P tpdA promoter is sufficient to alter c-di-GMP signaling responses such as swarming and biofilm formation in V. parahaemolyticus, an observation that could have important implications in the dynamics of these social behaviors.IMPORTANCEC-di-GMP trigger phosphodiesterases (PDEs) could play a key role in controlling the heterogeneity of biofilm-matrix composition, a property that endows characteristics that are potentially relevant for sustaining integrity and functionality of biofilms in a variety of natural environments.

The severity of the impact of this disease on aquaculture worldwide has made it necessary to develop alternatives to prophylactic antibiotics use, such as the application of probiotics. To assess the potential to use probiotics in order to limit the detrimental effects of AHNPD, we evaluated the effect of the ILI strain, a Vibrio sp. bacterium and efficient shrimp probiotic, using metabarcoding (16S rRNA gene) on the gastrointestinal microbiota of shrimp after being challenged with AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus. RESULTS: We showed how the gastrointestinal microbiome of shrimp varied between healthy and infected organisms. Nevertheless, a challenge of working with AHPND-causing Vibrio pathogens and Vibrio-related bacteria as probiotics is the potential risk of the probiotic strain becoming pathogenic. Consequently, we evaluated whether ILI strain can acquire the plasmid pV-AHPND via horizontal transfer and further cause the disease in shrimp. Conjugation assays were performed resulting in a high frequency (70%) of colonies harboring the pv-AHPND. However, no shrimp mortality was observed when transconjugant colonies of the ILI strain were used in a challenge test using healthy shrimp. We sequenced the genome of the ILI strain and performed comparative genomics analyses using AHPND and non-AHPND Vibrio isolates. Using available phylogenetic and phylogenomics analyses, we reclassified the ILI strain as Vibrio diabolicus. In summary, this work represents an effort to study the role that probiotics play in the normal gastrointestinal shrimp microbiome and in AHPND-infected shrimp, showing that the ILI probiotic was able to control pathogenic bacterial populations in the host's gastrointestinal tract and stimulate the shrimp's survival. The identification of probiotic bacterial species that are effective in the host's colonization is important to promote animal health and prevent disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes probiotic bacteria capable of controlling pathogenic populations of bacteria in the shrimp gastrointestinal tract. Our work provides new insights into the complex dynamics between shrimp and the changes in the microbiota. It also addresses the practical application of probiotics to solve problems with pathogens that cause high mortality-rate in shrimp farming around the world.

Among the various typing methods, serotyping is widely accepted and utilized by infectious disease specialists and infection control agencies for the detection and epidemiological investigation of this pathogen. Thus far, 13 O serotypes and 71 K serotypes have been defined; however, untypeable strains are frequently isolated during routine detection, and some new O and/or K antigens have been identified and characterized. During a serotyping survey in Shandong province, China from 2016 to 2018, we collected 411 clinical V. parahaemolyticus strains and found that nine of them are untypeable K antigen strains. In this study, we identified three K serotypes of V. parahaemolyticus through in-depth genetic analysis of the K antigen gene cluster, serological tests, and the production of antisera. Among the nine strains, seven possess K untypeable 2 (KUT2) antigens, which have been reported recently by another group. However, two new O and K combinations (O3:KUT2 and O11:KUT2) were first characterized by us, with the remaining two each representing a novel K serotype. Moreover, through comparative genomic analysis, we showed that the Shandong KUT2 strains exhibit different virulence profiles compared to their identical K serotype partners from Zhejiang province, another Chinese coastal province; however, strains from these two regions are clustered into the same linage and may have evolved from a recent common ancestor. Additionally, one isolate, SD2016062, was phylogenetically similar to the strains associated with several local gastroenteritis outbreaks, with similar toxin patterns, suggesting its potential to cause sporadic occurrences of disease or even local pandemics. Finally, we developed a sero-specific PCR assay targeting the three novel K serotypes, which can monitor the V. parahaemolyticus spectrum for clinical and epidemiological purposes.

In the aquaculture industry, feed acidifiers have been used to increase the growth of aquatic animals. However, there is limited study on the effects of acidic condition on the virulence and survival of pathogens in aquaculture. In this study, we investigated the survival ability of Vibrio parahaemolyticus at lethal acidic pH (4.0) after adapted the bacteria to sub-lethal acidic pH (5.5) for 1 hr. Our results indicated that the adapted strain increased the survival ability at lethal acidic pH invoked by an inorganic (HCl) or organic (citric) acid. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) results revealed that 321 genes were differentially expressed at the sub-lethal acidic pH including cadC, cadBA and groES/groEL relating to acid tolerance response (ATR), as well as genes relating to outer membrane, heat-shock proteins, phosphotransferase system and flagella system. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed that cadC and cadBA were upregulated under sub-lethal acidic conditions. The CadC protein could directly regulate the expression of cadBA to modulate the ATR in V. parahaemolyticus. RNA-seq data also indicated that 113 genes in the CadC-dependent way and 208 genes in the CadC-independent way were differentially expressed, which were related to the regulation of ATR.

The flagellation pattern of numerous bacteria is regulated by the NTPases FlhF and FlhG. In general, FlhG controls the number of flagella produced, whereas FlhF coordinates the position of the flagella. In the human pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus, its single flagellum is positioned and formed at the old cell pole. Here, we describe the spatiotemporal localization of FlhF and FlhG in V. parahaemolyticus and their effect on swimming motility. Absence of either FlhF or FlhG caused a significant defect in swimming ability, resulting in absence of flagella in a DeltaflhF mutant and an aberrant flagellated phenotype in DeltaflhG. Both proteins localized to the cell pole in a cell cycle-dependent manner, but displayed different patterns of localization throughout the cell cycle. FlhF transitioned from a uni- to bi-polar localization, as observed in other polarly flagellated bacteria. Localization of FlhG was strictly dependent on the cell pole-determinant HubP, while polar localization of FlhF was HubP independent. Furthermore, localization of FlhF and FlhG was interdependent and required for each other's proper intracellular localization and recruitment to the cell pole. In the absence of HubP or FlhF, FlhG forms non-polar foci in the cytoplasm of the cell, suggesting the possibility of a secondary localization site within the cell besides its recruitment to the cell poles.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fmicb.2021.655239 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['FlhF', 'FlhG', 'HubP', 'Vibrio parahaemolyticus', 'flagellum', 'intracellular organization']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Arroyo-Perez and Ringgaard.'],,

Additionally, elevated sea surface temperatures have direct effects on coral microbiomes by promoting growth and virulence of opportunists and putative pathogens, thereby altering host immunity and health. However, interactions between these biotic and abiotic factors have yet to be evaluated. Here, we used a factorial experiment to investigate the combined effects of fecal pellet deposition by the widely distributed surgeonfish Ctenochaetus striatus and elevated sea surface temperatures on microbiomes associated with the reef-building coral Porites lobata. Our results showed that regardless of temperature, exposure of P. lobata to C. striatus feces increased alpha diversity, dispersion, and lead to a shift in microbial community composition - all indicative of microbial dysbiosis. Although elevated temperature did not result in significant changes in alpha and beta diversity, we noted an increasing number of differentially abundant taxa in corals exposed to both feces and thermal stress within the first 48h of the experiment. These included opportunistic microbial lineages and taxa closely related to potential coral pathogens (i.e., Vibrio vulnificus, Photobacterium rosenbergii). Some of these taxa were absent in controls but present in surgeonfish feces under both temperature regimes, suggesting mechanisms of microbial transmission and/or enrichment from fish feces to corals. Importantly, the impact to coral microbiomes by fish feces under higher temperatures appeared to inhibit wound healing in corals, as percentages of tissue recovery at the site of feces deposition were lower at 30 degrees C compared to 26 degrees C. Lower percentages of tissue recovery were associated with greater relative abundance of several bacterial lineages, with some of them found in surgeonfish feces (i.e., Rhodobacteraceae, Bdellovibrionaceae, Crocinitomicaceae). Our findings suggest that fish feces interact with elevated sea surface temperatures to favor microbial opportunism and enhance dysbiosis susceptibility in P. lobata. As the frequency and duration of thermal stress related events increase, the ability of coral microbiomes to recover from biotic stressors such as deposition of fish feces may be greatly affected, ultimately compromising coral health and resilience.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fmicb.2021.620458 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['16S rRNA', 'Vibrio', 'coral', 'dysbiosis', 'feces', 'global change', 'surgeonfish', 'thermal stress']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Ezzat, Merolla, Clements, Munsterman, Landfield, Stensrud,', 'Schmeltzer, Burkepile and Vega Thurber.']",,

As a consequence, timely regulations of the flagellar components' expression are crucial to complete a biofilm life-cycle. In this study, we demonstrated that flagellins' production is regulated in a biofilm stage-specific manner, via activities of a protease DegQ and a chaperone FlaJ. Among four flagellin subunits for V. vulnificus filament, FlaC had the highest affinities to hook-associated proteins, and is critical for maturating flagellum, showed the least susceptibility to DegQ due to the presence of methionine residues in its DegQ-sensitive domains, ND1 and CD0.

Antibiotic resistance by all Vibrio species was mostly observed against doxycycline (71-89%), erythromycin (86-100%), tetracycline (71-89%), rifampicin (86-100%), and sulfamethoxazole (87-100%), though susceptibility to meropenem (86-100%), cephalothin (60-100%), norfloxacin (93-100%), ciprofloxacin (88-100%), amikacin (64-100%), gentamicin (57-74%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (57-81%) was equally observed in all species. Vibrio mimicus expressed highest resistance against streptomycin and chloramphenicol (64%), while V. vulnificus (52%) and V. cholerae (57%) had the highest resistance against cephalothin. High resistance against ampicillin (57%) and amoxicillin (50%) was exhibited by V. cholerae and V. mimicus respectively. Indexes of multiple antibiotic resistances (MARI) among Vibrio species ranged between 0.11 and 0.72 with the highest MAR index of 0.72 observed in one isolate of V. vulnificus. This study reveals high prevalence of Vibrio species in the selected rivers as well as elevated resistance against some first-line antibiotics, which suggests possible inappropriate antimicrobial usage around study communities. We conclude that the freshwater resources investigated are unfit for domestic, industrial, and recreational uses without treatment prior to use and are potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant Vibrio species in this environment.",1614-7499 (Electronic) 0944-1344 (Linking),2021 Apr 4,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4127-7236'],"['10.1007/s11356-021-13603-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11356-021-13603-4 [pii]']",['eng'],Germany,"['Antibiotics', 'Freshwater', 'Multidrug-resistant', 'Nigeria', 'Vibrio species']",,,

We hypothesized that migratory birds, coming from various environments, would carry more numerous Vibrio strains than sedentary species, with increased risk to be passed to their contacts or environment in habitats they transit or nest in. Similarly, we presumed that strains from migratory birds will show multidrug resistance. A total of 170 oral and rectal swabs were collected from wild birds captured in different locations of the Danube Delta (Malic, Sfantu-Gheorghe, Letea Forest) and processed using standardized selective media. V. cholerae strains were confirmed by serology and molecular methods and, subsequently, their susceptibility was evaluated. The prevalence of Vibrio species by host species, habitat type, and location was interpreted. The isolated Vibrio species were identified as Vibrio cholerae 14.33%, V. fluvialis 13.33%, V. alginolyticus 12%, V. mimicus 17.33%, V. vulnificus 10.88%, with V. parahaemolyticus and V. metschnikovii (16%) also being prevalent. Of the 76 Vibrio spp. isolates, 18.42% were resistant towards at least three antimicrobials, and 81.57% demonstrated a multidrug resistance phenotype, including mainly penicillins, aminoglycosides, and macrolides. The results of the present study indicate higher numbers of Vibrio strains in migratory (74.66%) than in sedentary birds (25.33%), confirming our hypothesis.

This marine bacterium could produce hemolysin (VVH), which often causes serious gastroenteritis or septicemia when people contact to seawater or seafood containing V. vulnificus. Timely diagnosis is regard as essential to disease surveillance. In this paper, we aimed at developing a quick and sensitive method for the detection of Vibrio vulnificus using real time recombinase polymerase amplification (real time RPA). Specific primers and an exo probe were designed on the basis of the vvhA gene sequence available in GenBank. Target DNA could be amplified and labeled with specific fluorophore within 20 min at 38 degrees C. The method exhibited a high specificity, only detecting Vibrio vulnificus and not showing cross-reaction with other bacteria. The sensitivity of this method was 2 pg per reaction (20 muL) for DNA, or 200 copies per reaction (20 muL) for standard plasmid. The detection limit (LOD) stated as the target level that would be detected 95% of the time and estimated was 1.58 x 10(2) copies by fit of the probit to the results of 8 replicates in different concentration. For quantitative analysis of the real time RPA, the second order polynomial regression was adopted in our study. The results showed the correlation coefficients were raised above 0.98, which suggested this model might be a better choice for the quantitative analysis of real time RPA compared to the routine linear regression model. For artificially contaminated plasma samples, Vibrio vulnificus could be detected within 16 min by real time RPA at concentration as low as 1.2 x 10(2) CFU/mL or 2.4 CFU per reaction (20 muL). Thus, the real time RPA method established in this study shows great potential for detecting Vibrio vulnificus in the research laboratory and disease diagnosis.",1096-1194 (Electronic) 0890-8508 (Linking),2021 Mar 28,,"['S0890-8508(21)00033-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcp.2021.101726 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['Detection', 'Real time recombinase polymerase amplification', 'Vibrio vulnificus', 'vvhA gene']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their native function remains unknown. Previous work indicated that expression of qnrVv in V. vulnificus was induced by cold shock. To investigate its role further we constructed single in-frame deletion mutants in qnrVv and cspA (the gene for cold shock protein), and a double mutant in qnrVv and cspA in V. vulnificus ATCC 17562 to evaluate the response to different environmental conditions and stresses and to exposure to various DNA damaging agents. We found that qnrVv is involved in resistance to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and mitomycin C, and in the cold shock response in V. vulnificus Moreover, DeltaqnrVv and DeltacspA mutants showed a lower growth when they were treated with bile salts at 37 degrees C and then shifted to 15 degrees C (cold shock) without bile salts in the media, with the effect being higher in the double mutant. This transition may mimic what happens when V. vulnificus is ingested into the gastrointestinal tract and released in its natural environment. Cold shock and bile salts induced the expression of cspA and DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV genes.

A new strain of V. vulnificus FORC_016 was isolated from a patient's blood sample in South Korea. The genome consists of two circular DNA chromosomes: chromosome I (3,234,424 bp with a G + C contents of 46.60% containing 2,889 ORFs, 106 tRNA genes, and 31 rRNA genes) and chromosome II (1,837,945 bp with a GC content of 47.00% containing 1,572 ORFs, 13 tRNA genes, and 3 rRNA genes). In addition, chromosome I has a super integron (SI) containing 209 ORFs, which is probably associated with various additional functions including antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. Pan-genome analysis with other V. vulnificus genomes revealed that core genome regions contain most of the important virulence factors. However, accessory genome regions are located in the SI region and contain unique genes regarding cell wall biosynthesis and generation of host cell protecting capsule, suggesting possible resistance ability against environmental stresses. Comparative RNA-Seq analysis of samples between contact and no contact to the crab conditions showed that expressions of amino acid/peptide and carbohydrate transport and utilization genes were down-regulated, but expressions of cell division and growth-related genes were up-regulated, suggesting that the crab may be a nutrition reservoir for rapid propagation of V. vulnificus. Therefore, consumption of the contaminated fresh crab would provide a large number of V. vulnificus to humans, which may be more dangerous. Consequently, biocontrol of V. vulnificus may be critical to ensure the safety in seafood consumption.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fmicb.2021.645860 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Vibrio vulnificus', 'food-borne pathogen', 'fresh crab', 'genomics', 'transcriptomics', 'virulence factor']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kim, Chung, Kwon, Choi and Lee.']",,

Constrained optimization (CO) helps to address some of the acknowledged limitations of conventional health economic analyses and has typically been used to identify the optimal allocation of resources across interventions subject to a variety of constraints. METHODS: A dynamic transmission model was developed to predict the number of dengue cases in Thailand at steady state. A CO was then applied to identify the optimal combination of interventions (release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and paediatric vaccination) within the constraints of a fixed budget, set no higher than cost estimates of the current vector control programme, to minimize the number of dengue cases and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. Epidemiological, cost, and effectiveness data were informed by national data and the research literature. The time horizon was 10 years. Scenario analyses examined different disease management and intervention costs, budget constraints, vaccine efficacy, and optimization time horizon. RESULTS: Under base-case budget constraints, the optimal coverage of the two interventions to minimize dengue incidence was predicted to be nearly equal (Wolbachia 50%; paediatric vaccination 49%) with corresponding coverages under lower bound (Wolbachia 54%; paediatric vaccination 10%) and upper bound (Wolbachia 67%; paediatric vaccination 100%) budget ceilings. Scenario analyses indicated that the most impactful situations related to the costs of Wolbachia and paediatric vaccination with decreases/ increases in costs of interventions demonstrating a direct correlation with coverage (increases/ decreases) of the respective control strategies under examination. CONCLUSIONS: Determining the best investment strategy for dengue control requires the identification of the optimal mix of interventions to implement in order to maximize public health outcomes, often under fixed budget constraints. A CO model was developed with the objective of minimizing dengue cases (and DALYs lost) over a 10-year time horizon, within the constraints of the estimated budgets for vector control in the absence of vaccination and Wolbachia. The model provides a tool for developing estimates of optimal coverage of combined dengue control strategies that minimize dengue burden at the lowest budget.",1471-2458 (Electronic) 1471-2458 (Linking),2021 Apr 27,,"['10.1186/s12889-021-10747-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12889-021-10747-3 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Constrained optimization', 'Dengue', 'Vaccination Wolbachia']",,,

This epidemiological model has four possible outcomes: with or without Wolbachia and with or without dengue. To reach the desired outcome, with Wolbachia and without dengue, we employ the dynamic optimization approach and then design optimal programs for releasing Wolbachia-carrying male and female mosquitoes. Our discussion is focused on advantages and drawbacks of two Wolbachia strains, wMelPop and wMel, that are recommended for dengue prevention and control. On the one hand, the wMel strain guarantees a faster population replacement, ensures durable Wolbachia persistence in the wild mosquito population, and requiters fewer releases.

At the genomic level, recombination within and between strains, transposable elements, and horizontal transfer of strains between host species make Wolbachia an evolutionarily dynamic bacterial system. The invasive cherry fruit fly Rhagoletis cingulata arrived in Europe from North America ~40 years ago, where it now co-occurs with the native cherry pest R. cerasi. This shared distribution has been proposed to have led to the horizontal transfer of different Wolbachia strains between the two species. To better understand transmission dynamics, we performed a comparative genome study of the strain wCin2 in its native United States and invasive European populations of R. cingulata with wCer2 in European R. cerasi. Previous multilocus sequence genotyping (MLST) of six genes implied that the source of wCer2 in R. cerasi was wCin2 from R. cingulata. However, we report genomic evidence discounting the recent horizontal transfer hypothesis for the origin of wCer2. Despite near identical sequences for the MLST markers, substantial sequence differences for other loci were found between wCer2 and wCin2, as well as structural rearrangements, and differences in prophage, repetitive element, gene content, and cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing genes.

The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a model insect for understanding Wolbachia-host interactions. Here the native wMel strain of D. melanogaster was isolated and then different initial titres of wMel were artificially transferred back into antibiotics-treated fruit flies. Our purpose was to examine the interactions between the injected wMel in a density gradient and the recipient host during trans-generational transmission. The results showed that the trans-generational transmission rates of wMel and titres of wMel exhibited a fluctuating trend over nine generations, and the titres of wMel displayed a similar fluctuating trans-generational trend. There was a significant positive correlation between the transmission rate and the titre of wMel. Reciprocal crossings between wMel-transinfected and uninfected fruit flies revealed that wMel could induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) at different initial titres, but the intensity of CI was not significantly correlated with the initial titre of wMel. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that the immune genes Drsl5 and Spn38F displayed a significant transcriptional response to wMel transfection, with an obvious negative correlation with the titre of wMel at the 3(rd) and 4(th) generations. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Drsl5 and Spn38F elicited a drastic increase in the titre of wMel.

Here, we compared the developmental duration and body weight in different instars of Wolbachia-positive (W(+) ) and Wolbachia-negative (W(-) ) spiders (Hylyphantes graminicola) and detected the relative expression levels of six insulin-related genes and three ecdysone-related genes using reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR). Results showed that the developmental duration was significantly shortened in W(+) spiders compared with W(-) spiders.

This presents an opportunity to inhibit heme synthesis, which leads to depriving the filarial worm of heme, resulting in a subsequent macrofilaricidal effect. High throughput virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular simulations with binding energy calculations led to the identification of paritaprevir and nilotinib as potential anti-Wolbachia agents. Having higher binding affinities to the catalytic pocket than the natural substrate, these drugs have the structural potential to bind and engage active site residues of the wolbachia 5'-Aminolevulinic Acid Synthase.

We conducted site visits at the camp and Dairy A where we collected milk and other samples. Samples were cultured for Y. enterocolitica. Clinical and nonclinical isolates were compared using molecular subtyping. We performed case finding, conducted telephone interviews for community cases, and conducted a cohort study among adult camp staff by administering an online questionnaire. In total, we identified 109 Y. enterocolitica cases. Consumption of Dairy A milk was known for 37 (34%); of these, Dairy A milk was consumed by 31 (84%). Dairy A had shipped 214 gallons of pasteurized milk in 5 weekly shipments to the camp by mid-July. Dairy A milk was the only shared exposure identified between the camp and community. Y. enterocolitica was isolated from Dairy A unpasteurized milk samples. Five clinical isolates from camp members, two clinical isolates from community members, and nine isolates from unpasteurized milk were indistinguishable by whole-genome sequencing. The risk for yersinosis among camp staff who drank Dairy A milk was 5.3 times the risk for those who did not (95% confidence interval: 1.6-17.3). Because Dairy A only sold pasteurized milk, pasteurized milk was considered the outbreak source.

However, Yersinia pestis (plague), a flea-borne pathogen of mammals that was introduced to western North America, has the greatest negative impact on at least some species of rodents during years of above-average precipitation. In the absence of plague mitigation, negative effects of plague in wet years might overwhelm the otherwise beneficial effects of increased moisture. In Montana and Utah, USA, where plague now occurs enzootically, we investigated the influence of precipitation on finite rates of annual population change (2000-2005) for 3 species of prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) in replicated plots treated with deltamethrin dust and in non-treated plots for paired comparisons. There was a significant interaction between precipitation and treatment. When we reduced plague vector fleas, prairie dog visual counts tended to increase with increasing precipitation. Simultaneously, there was a negative relationship between counts and precipitation on paired plots where plague was not managed, suggesting that plague transformed and reversed the otherwise beneficial effect of increased precipitation. Are the good years gone for prairie dogs? Even if the good years are not gone, they are perhaps relatively scarce compared to historic times prior to the invasion of plague. This scenario might apply to other ecosystems and may pose broad conservation challenges in western North America.",2213-2244 (Print) 2213-2244 (Linking),2021 Apr,,"['10.1016/j.ijppaw.2021.02.006 [doi]', 'S2213-2244(21)00020-1 [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Cynomys', 'Disease ecology', 'Flea', 'Food web', 'Precipitation', 'Siphonaptera', 'Yersinia pestis']","['(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Australian Society for', 'Parasitology.']",,

In order to investigate the streptomycin resistance of Y. pestis in China, we evaluated streptomycin susceptibility of 536 Y. pestis strains in China in vitro using the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and screened streptomycin resistance-associated genes (strA and strB) by PCR method. A clinical Y. pestis isolate (S19960127) exhibited high-level resistance to streptomycin (the MIC was 4,096 mg/L). The strain (biovar antiqua) was isolated from a pneumonic plague outbreak in 1996 in Tibet Autonomous Region, China, belonging to the Marmota himalayana Qinghai-Tibet Plateau plague focus. In contrast to previously reported streptomycin resistance mediated by conjugative plasmids, the genome sequencing and allelic replacement experiments demonstrated that an rpsL gene (ribosomal protein S12) mutation with substitution of amino-acid 43 (K43R) was responsible for the high-level resistance to streptomycin in strain S19960127, which is consistent with the mutation reported in some streptomycin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Streptomycin is used as the first-line treatment against plague in many countries. The emergence of streptomycin resistance in Y. pestis represents a critical public health problem. So streptomycin susceptibility monitoring of Y. pestis isolates should not only include plasmid-mediated resistance but also include the ribosomal protein S12 gene (rpsL) mutation, especially when treatment failure is suspected due to antibiotic resistance.",1935-2735 (Electronic) 1935-2727 (Linking),2021 Apr 22,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2651-665X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3257-1540']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0009324 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-20-01961 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

How Y. pestis persists long-term in the environment between these epizootics is poorly understood but multiple mechanisms have been proposed, including, among others, a separate enzootic transmission cycle that maintains Y. pestis without involvement of epizootic hosts and persistence of Y. pestis within epizootic host populations without causing high mortality within those populations. We live-trapped and collected fleas from black-tailed prairie dogs and other mammal species from sites with and without black-tailed prairie dogs in 2004 and 2005 and tested all fleas for presence of Y. pestis. Y. pestis was not detected in 2,126 fleas collected in 2004 but was detected in 294 fleas collected from multiple sites in 2005, before and during a widespread epizootic that drastically reduced black-tailed prairie dog populations in the affected colonies. Temporal and spatial patterns of Y. pestis occurrence in fleas and genotyping of Y. pestis present in some infected fleas suggest Y. pestis was introduced multiple times from sources outside the study area and once introduced, was dispersed between several sites. We conclude Y. pestis likely was not present in these black-tailed prairie dog colonies prior to epizootic activity in these colonies. Although we did not identify likely enzootic hosts, we found evidence that deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) may serve as bridging hosts for Y. pestis between unknown enzootic hosts and black-tailed prairie dogs.

New antimicrobials are urgently needed. The injectisome type III secretion system (T3SS), required by dozens of Gram-negative bacteria for virulence but largely absent from non-pathogenic bacteria, is an attractive antimicrobial target. We previously identified synthetic cyclic peptomers, inspired by the natural product phepropeptin D, that inhibit protein secretion through the Yersinia Ysc and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Psc T3SSs, but do not inhibit bacterial growth. Here we describe identification of an isomer, 4EpDN, that is two-fold more potent (IC50 of 4 muM) than its parental compound. Furthermore, 4EpDN inhibited the Yersinia Ysa and the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SSs, suggesting that this cyclic peptomer has broad efficacy against evolutionarily distant injectisome T3SSs. Indeed, 4EpDN strongly inhibited intracellular growth of Chlamydia trachomatis in HeLa cells, which requires the T3SS. 4EpDN did not inhibit the unrelated Twin arginine translocation (Tat) system, nor did it impact T3SS gene transcription. Moreover, although the injectisome and flagellar T3SSs are evolutionarily and structurally related, the 4EpDN cyclic peptomer did not inhibit secretion of substrates through the Salmonella flagellar T3SS, indicating that cyclic peptomers broadly but specifically target the injestisome T3SS. 4EpDN reduced the number of T3SS needles detected on the surface of Y. pseudotuberculosis as detected by microscopy. Collectively, these data suggest that cyclic peptomers specifically inhibit the injectisome T3SS from a variety of Gram-negative bacteria, possibly by preventing complete T3SS assembly.",1098-6596 (Electronic) 0066-4804 (Linking),2021 Apr 19,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6323-2146'],"['AAC.01690-20 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.01690-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 Lam et al.'],,

Most HCT recipients experience diarrhea in the post-transplantation period, and infectious pathogens are frequently detected during diarrheal episodes. However, little is known about how frequently these patients are colonized with gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens before their transplantation and whether colonization predicts future diarrheal illness. We sought to determine how frequently HCT recipients are colonized with GI pathogens before HCT and the degree to which pre-HCT colonization predicts post-transplantation infectious diarrheal illness. We conducted a prospective cohort study of allogeneic and autologous HCT recipients at a single center between December 2016 and January 2019. Stool samples were collected during the week before HCT, and formed samples were evaluated for the presence of 22 diarrheal pathogens using the BioFire FilmArray GI panel. We determined the frequency with which participants were colonized with each pathogen and identified factors associated with colonization. We then determined how frequently pretransplantation colonization led to post-transplantation diarrheal infections due to the colonizing pathogen and whether colonization was associated with increased number of days of post-transplantation diarrhea during the transplant hospitalization. We enrolled 112 asymptomatic patients (allogeneic, 61%; autologous, 39%) who had a formed stool specimen before HCT, of whom 41 (37%) had a GI pathogen detected. The most commonly detected organisms were Clostridioides difficile (n = 21; 19%), Yersinia enterocolitica (n = 9; 8%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (n = 6; 6%), and norovirus (n = 5; 4%). Female sex and previous C. difficile infection were associated with C. difficile colonization, and having non-Hodgkin lymphoma was associated with being colonized with a diarrheal pathogen other than C. difficile. Thirteen of 21 patients (62%) with pretransplantation C. difficile colonization developed a clinical C. difficile infection post-transplantation, and 8 of 10 patients (80%) colonized with EPEC or enteroaggregative E. coli developed post-transplantation infections due to their colonizing pathogen. Pretransplantation C. difficile colonization was also associated with an increased duration of post-transplantation diarrhea (P = .048). Conversely, none of the 9 patients with pretransplantation Yersinia enterocolitica colonization developed a post-transplantation Y. enterocolitica infection. Patients admitted for HCT are frequently colonized with a diverse range of GI pathogens. Colonization with C. difficile colonization and diarrheagenic E. coli is frequently associated with post-transplantation diarrheal infections caused by these organisms, but the clinical significance of colonization with other GI pathogens is not clear.",2666-6367 (Electronic) 2666-6367 (Linking),2021 Feb 18,,"['S2666-6367(21)00678-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtct.2021.02.012 [doi]']",['eng'],,"['Colonization', 'Diarrhea', 'Gastrointestinal pathogens', 'Hematopoietic cell transplant', 'Multiplexed PCR']","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies on a subset of unrelated orchid species utilized in these traditional practices revealed they possessed antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant activity, providing experimental proof for their medicinal properties. To date however none of these species have been investigated ethno-botanically in a phylogenetic context. This study carried out comparative bioprospecting for a group of wild orchids using EBDCS (the Economic Botany Data Collection Standards) organ targeted and biological response methods. The traditional medicinal use of necklace orchids was recorded from books and journals published between 1984 and 2016. Two orchids, Coelogyne cristata and Coelogyne fimbriata, were selected, cultivated both indoors and outdoors, and the antimicrobial properties on extracts from their leaves and pseudobulbs tested against a selection of human pathogens. A molecular phylogeny of Coelogyninae based on nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid matK DNA sequences obtained from 148 species was reconstructed with Maximum Likelihood (ML) using RAxML, Maximum Parsimony (MP) using PAUP and Bayesian Inference using MrBayes. Bioprospecting comparison of EBDCS and biological response was carried out using customized R scripts. Ethanolic extracts obtained from leaves of C. fimbriata inhibited growth of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica, confirming the antimicrobial properties of these extracts. Leaf extracts were found to have slightly stronger antimicrobial properties for plants cultivated outdoors than indoors. These differences were not found to be statistically significant though.

Protein secretion by the T3SS injectisome is activated upon contact to any host cell, and it has been unclear how premature secretion is prevented during infection. Here we report that in the gastrointestinal pathogens Yersinia enterocolitica and Shigella flexneri, cytosolic injectisome components are temporarily released from the proximal interface of the injectisome at low external pH, preventing protein secretion in acidic environments, such as the stomach. We show that in Yersinia enterocolitica, low external pH is detected in the periplasm and leads to a partial dissociation of the inner membrane injectisome component SctD, which in turn causes the dissociation of the cytosolic T3SS components. This effect is reversed upon restoration of neutral pH, allowing a fast activation of the T3SS at the native target regions within the host. These findings indicate that the cytosolic components form an adaptive regulatory interface, which regulates T3SS activity in response to environmental conditions.",2041-1723 (Electronic) 2041-1723 (Linking),2021 Mar 12,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3417-5100', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7080-4907', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3150-6752', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7340-2444', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7801-6278', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4475-3923']","['10.1038/s41467-021-21863-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-021-21863-4 [pii]']",['eng'],England,,,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Type III Secretion Systems)']","['Bacterial Adhesion', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Protein Transport/*physiology', 'Shigella flexneri/metabolism', 'Type III Secretion Systems/genetics/*metabolism', 'Yersinia enterocolitica/metabolism']"

There are 13 natural plague foci in the Caucasus, located on the territory of the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia. We performed whole-genome sequencing of Y. pestis strains, isolated in the natural foci of the Caucasus and Transcaucasia. Using the data of whole-genome SNP analysis and Bayesian phylogeny methods, we carried out an evolutionary-phylogeographic analysis of modern population of the plague pathogen in order to determine the phylogenetic relationships of Y. pestis strains from the Caucasus with the strains from other countries. RESULTS: We used 345 Y. pestis genomes to construct a global evolutionary phylogenetic reconstruction of species based on whole-genome SNP analysis. The genomes of 16 isolates were sequenced in this study, the remaining 329 genomes were obtained from the GenBank database. Analysis of the core genome revealed 3315 SNPs that allow differentiation of strains. The evolutionary phylogeographic analysis showed that the studied Y. pestis strains belong to the genetic lineages 0.PE2, 2.MED0, and 2.MED1. It was shown that the Y. pestis strains isolated on the territory of the East Caucasian high-mountain, the Transcaucasian high-mountain and the Priaraksinsky low-mountain plague foci belong to the most ancient of all existing genetic lineages - 0.PE2. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the whole-genome SNP analysis of 345 Y. pestis strains, we describe the modern population structure of the plague pathogen and specify the place of the strains isolated in the natural foci of the Caucasus and Transcaucasia in the structure of the global population of Y. pestis.

They often exhibit variation in morphological features that can make correct species identification and management challenging. This may also apply to Xenopsylla brasiliensis (Baker, 1904), an important plague vector. In the current study, we aimed to provide genetic tools for reliable species identification using a DNA barcoding approach. A total of 73 flea specimens was collected from a native host (Namaqua rock mouse, Micaelamys namaquensis) in South Africa and identified morphologically. In addition, we took measurements of 7 morphological characteristics. Subsequently, we successfully generated barcodes of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene for X. brasiliensis. We validated this approach by comparing our data to COI sequences from Rwandan X. brasiliensis. While sequences from both regions suggested a close relationship between the 2 X. brasiliensis populations, both haplotype and nucleotide diversity were substantially larger for the South African specimens.

MUC1 also influences epithelial cell morphology and receptor function. Various bacterial pathogens can exploit integrins to infect eukaryotic cells. It is yet unclear whether MUC1 influences the interaction of bacteria with integrins. We used Escherichia coli expressing the invasin (inv) protein of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (E. coli inv) to assess the effects of MUC1 on beta1 integrin (ITGB1)-mediated bacterial invasion. Our results show that expression of full-length MUC1 does not yield a physical barrier but slightly enhances E. coli inv uptake. Enzymatic removal of the MUC1 extracellular domain (ED) using a secreted protease of C1 esterase inhibitor (StcE) of pathogenic Escherichia coli had no additional effect on E. coli inv invasion. In contrast, expression of a truncated MUC1 that lacks the cytoplasmic tail (CT) reduced bacterial entry substantially. Substitution of tyrosine residues in the MUC1 CT also reduced bacterial uptake, while deletion of the C-terminal half of the cytoplasmic tail only had a minor effect, pointing to a regulatory role of tyrosine phosphorylation and the N-terminal region of the MUC1 CT in integrin-mediated uptake process. Unexpectedly, StcE removal of the ED in MUC1-DeltaCT cells reversed the block in bacterial invasion. Together, these findings indicate that MUC1 can facilitate beta1-integrin-mediated bacterial invasion by a concerted action of the large glycosylated extracellular domain and the membrane-juxtaposed cytoplasmic tail region.IMPORTANCE Bacteria can exploit membrane receptor integrins for cellular invasion, either by direct binding of bacterial adhesins or utilizing extracellular matrix components. MUC1 is a large transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by most epithelial cells that can have direct defensive or receptor functions at the host-microbe interface and is involved in facilitating integrin clustering. We investigated the role of epithelial MUC1 on beta1 integrin-mediated bacterial invasion. We discovered that MUC1 does not act as a barrier but facilitates bacterial entry through beta1 integrins. This process involves a concerted action of the MUC1 O-glycosylated extracellular domain and cytoplasmic tail. Our findings add a new dimension to the complexity of bacterial invasion mechanisms and provide novel insights into the distinct functions of MUC1 domains at the host-microbe interface.",2150-7511 (Electronic),2021 Apr 6,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5096-317X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8661-7594', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4126-8172', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9167-7137']","['mBio.03491-20 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.03491-20 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['*ITGB1', '*MUC1', '*bacterial invasion', '*host-bacteria interactions', '*host-bacterial interaction', '*integrins', '*mucins', '*transmembrane mucin', '*beta1 integrin']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Li et al.'],,

It can infect livestock as well as pets and wild animals. During the last years, a number of reports describe the isolation of Y. pseudotuberculosis from zoo animals, mainly birds and mammals, for which the infection was mostly lethal. Between 2005 and 2019, there were at least 17 cases of deceased mammals belonging to five different species at the Zoo Wuppertal, Germany, which suffered from a Y. pseudotuberculosis infection. Since only scarce information exists on properties of Y. pseudotuberculosis from zoo animals, we characterized eight isolates, covering all infected species, in detail. All of them are members of biotype 1, but belong to five serotypes, five sequence types (STs) and even seven cgMLST types. Using Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), seven isolates could be discriminated from each other. They differ significantly regarding their virulence genes and mobile genetic elements. While the virulence plasmid pYV existed in all serotypes (five isolates), a complete high pathogenicity island (HPI) was detected only in the serotypes O:1a, O:1b and O:13 (four isolates), but not in O:2a and O:2b. Similarly, the content of other plasmids and prophages varies greatly between the isolates.

Based on these features, bioinformatics analysis has predicted a putative LcrF-binding site in its target promoters. Here, we experimentally characterized its binding motif. An adenine-rich LcrF-binding region in the lcrG promoter sequence, a typical regulatory target of LcrF, was first confirmed. To obtain detailed information, this binding region was cloned into a synthetized promoter and mutations in this region were further constructed. We demonstrated that the 5'-AAAAA-n5-GnCT-3' sequence is required for LcrF regulation and this motif is strictly located 4-bp upstream of a noncanonical promoter, in which the -35 and -10 elements are separated by a 21-bp spacer. Consistently, the putative binding motif was found in promoters of nine T3SS related operons or genes positively regulated by LcrF. Transcriptome analysis further confirmed that LcrF specifically activates T3SS genes in Yersinia. Collectively, our data suggest that LcrF has evolved to be a specific T3SS activator with a stringent sequence requirement for transcriptional regulation.",1574-6968 (Electronic) 0378-1097 (Linking),2021 Apr 22,,"['6168405 [pii]', '10.1093/femsle/fnab031 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['LcrF', 'Promoter', 'Regulatory target', 'T3SS', 'Transcriptional regulation', 'Yerisnia']",['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

There was no convincing evidence that VGS IE frequency, morbidity, or mortality has increased since 2007. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a review of the available evidence, there are no recommended changes to the 2007 VGS IE prevention guidelines. We continue to recommend VGS IE prophylaxis only for categories of patients at highest risk for adverse outcome while emphasizing the critical role of good oral health and regular access to dental care for all. Randomized controlled studies to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective against VGS IE are needed to further refine recommendations.",1524-4539 (Electronic) 0009-7322 (Linking),2021 Apr 15,,['10.1161/CIR.0000000000000969 [doi]'],['eng'],United States,"['AHA Scientific Statements', 'antibiotic prophylaxis', 'dental care', 'endocarditis', 'oral health', 'viridans streptococci']",,,

The biggest risk factor for paediatric infective endocarditis today is underlying congenital heart defects. The most common causative organisms are Staphylococcus aureus and the viridans group of streptococci. The spectrum of symptoms varies widely in children and this produces difficulty in the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis in children is reliant on the modified Duke criteria. The use of blood cultures remains the most effective microbiological test for pathogen identification. However, in blood culture-negative infective endocarditis, serology testing and IgG titres are more effective for diagnosis. Imaging techniques used include echocardiograms, computed tomography and positron emission tomography. Biomarkers utilised in diagnosis are C-reactive protein, with recent literature reviewing the use of interleukin-15 and C-C motif chemokine ligand for reliable risk prediction. The American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines have been compared to describe the differences in the approach to infective endocarditis in children. Medical intervention involves the use of antimicrobial treatment and surgical interventions include the repair and replacement of cardiac valves. Quality of life is highly likely to improve from surgical intervention.Conclusion: Over the past decades, there have been great advancements in clinical practice to improve outcomes in patients with infective endocarditis. Nonetheless, further work is required to better investigative and manage such high risk cohort.

The bacteria are also often confused with streptococci species or treated as a contaminant. Patients and Methodology: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study on all patients with Aerococcus spp. isolates in blood samples from July 2010 to June 2019. All categorical data were presented as counts and proportions, whereas continuous data were presented as median and interquartile ranges. Results: A total of 20 Aerococcus spp. isolates were identified over the study period of 9 years. Of these, Aerococcus urinae was isolated in 10 (50%), Aerococcus viridans in 6 (30%), and Aerococcus spp. (not speciated) in 4 (20%). The median age was 74.3 years (12 males and 8 females). The two most frequent presentations were fever (15 of 20) and altered mentation (6 of 15). Most of the patients (11 of 15) had at least one predisposing comorbidity related to the urinary tract system (8 with recurrent urinary tract infection, 7 with urinary incontinence, 3 with an indwelling catheter, 2 with renal stones, and 1 each with benign prostatic hyperplasia and a recent cystoscopy). The median white blood cell count was 18,426 cells/mL, median hemoglobin 10.96 g/dL, median platelet count 191,000 cells/muL, median blood urea nitrogen 28.6 mg/dL, and median creatinine 1.54 mg/dL. The urinary tract was the most likely source of bacteremia (10 of 20) based on either imaging findings (5 cases), positive urine culture for Aerococcus spp. (4 cases), or instrumentation history (1 case). In the rest, the cause of bacteremia could not be found. Endocarditis was suspected in 9 out of 20 patients. Transthoracic echocardiography/transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed 3 cases (2 aortic valves, 1 mitral valve and pacemaker). Interestingly, one case had septic emboli causing a right frontal stroke with a normal TEE and normal Doppler study for deep venous thrombosis. Blood cultures were positive in 35% (7 of 20) with polymicrobial growth, 3 with coagulase-negative staphylococci, 2 with Enterococcus faecalis, and the other 2 each with Diphtheroids spp. and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 20 cases, 9 and 10 required intensive care unit level care and vasopressor support, respectively. Most of the patients were treated for 5-14 days except the 3 cases with infective endocarditis (IE). The median hospital stay duration was 6.55 days with 2 fatalities (2 out of 20 patients). Conclusion: Old age and underlying urologic conditions are the best-known risk factors for Aerococcus spp. infection. Recent advances in diagnostic technology have led to an increase in detection of Aerococcus spp.-related infections. The rare occurrence of Aerococcus spp. in human infections and resultant lack of randomized control trials have resulted in a significant degree of clinical uncertainty in the management of Aerococcus spp. IE.",2213-8803 (Electronic) 2213-879X (Linking),2021 Jan-Mar,,"['10.4103/JMAU.JMAU_61_19 [doi]', 'JMAU-9-18 [pii]']",['eng'],India,"['Aerococcus', 'bacteremia', 'infection']",['Copyright: (c) 2020 Journal of Microscopy and Ultrastructure.'],,

METHODS: The cariogenic three-species biofilm consis-ted of the cariogenic Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) and commensal bacteria Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis) and Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii). The biofilm was treated using GH12 (2, 4, and 8 mg.L(-1)), and untreated biofilm was used as the control. Changes in the morphology and structure of the three-species biofilm were evaluated through crystal violet staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Moreover, S. mutans in the biofilm was selectively cultured, and its colony-forming units were counted. RESULTS: The biomass and density of the cariogenic three-species biofilm treated with GH12 decreased compared with those of the control. The number of S. mutans decreased gradually and eventually became undetectable, whereas the number of S. gordonii and S. sanguinis increased and became predominant in the biofilm.

Longitudinal surveillance of causative pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and antibiotic therapy is important for optimal therapy strategies. Objectives: To describe the incidence of culture-confirmed EOS, causative pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and antibiotic therapy over a 23-year period. Methods: Retrospective population-based study from a single-center neonatal intensive care unit at Stavanger University Hospital, Norway, covering a population in South-West Norway, during the 23-year period 1996-2018. Results: Of 104,377 live born infants, 101 infants (0.97/1,000) had culture-confirmed EOS; 89 with Gram positive and 12 with Gram-negative bacteria. The EOS-attributable mortality was 6/101 (5.8%). For the three most prevalent pathogens the incidences were; Group B streptococcus (GBS) 0.57/1,000, Escherichia coli 0.11/1,000 and viridans group streptococci (VGS) 0.10/1,000. GBS was the most common pathogen (59/93; 63%) in infants with gestational age (GA) >/= 28 weeks. In contrast, among extremely preterm infants (GA <28 weeks) the incidence of E. coli infection was higher than for GBS infection. The second most common bacterial pathogens causing EOS among term infants were VGS. There was no change in the incidence of EOS for the entire study period, but from 2000 to 2018 there was a mean decline in EOS by 6% per year (95% CI 1%-10%) (p = 0.019). The incidences of GBS and E. coli did not change during the study period. The initial empirical antibiotic regimen for EOS was in all cases a combination of benzylpenicillin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside, but in 21/101 (21%) of cases a broad-spectrum antibiotic was either added or substituted this regimen. In 2/101 (2%) EOS cases, the pathogens were nonsusceptible to the empirical antibiotic regimen. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides. Conclusion: GBS was the most common causative pathogens in EOS, but E. coli dominated in infants with GA <28 weeks. There was no change in the incidence of EOS during the entire study period. The current empiric regimen with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin provides a very high coverage for EOS in our setting.",2296-2360 (Print) 2296-2360 (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fped.2021.634798 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['antibiotic resistance', 'antibiotic susceptibility', 'antibiotic therapy', 'early-onset sepsis', 'infection', 'neonatal sepsis']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Vatne, Klingenberg, Rettedal and Oymar.']",,

In this work, eight peptides derived from the Cry11Bb protoxin produced by B. thuringiensis subsp. medellin were selected and evaluated to investigate their membrane permeabilization and cytolytic activities, using red blood cells and cancer cell lines A549, MCF-7 and Caco-2, respectively. The most active peptides permeabilized red blood cells in a membrane potential-dependent manner. Half maximal inhibitory concentration in cancer cells was in the range 0.78-7.63 muM. At the same time, at peptides concentration of 25 muM, the hemolysis percentage varied in the range of 4.6-32.4%. The peptides BTM-P1 and BTM-P4 in D form had the lowest IC50 values on the MCF-7 cell line and they are considered as the most promising peptides among the evaluated. Fluorescence microscopy using AnnexinV-FLUOS staining indicates that the possible cause of MCF-7 cell death by peptide BTM-P1, is apoptosis. Real time PCR analysis showed an increased transcription of p53 in MCF-7 cells, thus confirming the probable pro-apoptotic effect of the peptide BTM-P1. In general, this study suggests that the cytolytic activity of the polycationic peptides derived from the Cry11Bb protoxin could be mediated by a pro-apoptotic mechanism that might include potential-dependent membrane permeabilization. Further studies might be accomplished to establish whether the peptides are cytolytic to other cancer cell lines and to solid tumors.",1096-0384 (Electronic) 0003-9861 (Linking),2021 Apr 24,,"['S0003-9861(21)00141-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.abb.2021.108891 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,"['Bacillus thuringiensis', 'Cell apoptosis', 'Cell swelling', 'Peptides', 'Plasma membrane potential']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, we identified that MAPK-mediated reduced expression of the PxABCB1 gene is associated with Bt Cry1Ac resistance in the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.). However, the underlying transcriptional regulation mechanism remains enigmatic. Herein, the PxABCB1 promoter in Cry1Ac-susceptible and Cry1Ac-resistant P. xylostella strains was cloned and analyzed and found to contain a putative Jun binding site (JBS). A dual-luciferase reporter assay and yeast one-hybrid assay (Y1H) demonstrated that the transcription factor PxJun repressed PxABCB1 expression by interacting with this JBS. The expression levels of PxJun were increased in the midguts of all resistant strains compared to the susceptible strain. Silencing of PxJun expression significantly elevated PxABCB1 expression and Cry1Ac susceptibility in the resistant NIL-R strain, and silencing of PxMAP4K4 expression decreased PxJun expression and also increased PxABCB1 expression. These results indicate that MAPK-activated PxJun suppresses PxABCB1 expression to confer Cry1Ac resistance in P. xylostella, deepening our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of midgut Cry receptor genes and the molecular basis of insect resistance to Bt Cry toxins.ImportanceThe transcriptional regulation mechanisms underlying reduced expression of Bt toxin receptor genes in Bt-resistant insects remain elusive.

Parasitic nematode drug resistance in veterinary medicine and drug recalcitrance in human medicine are increasing worldwide, with few if any new therapeutic classes on the horizon. Some of these parasites are zoonotic, e.g., Ascaris is passed from humans to pigs and vice versa. The development of new therapies against this family of parasites would have major implications for both human and livestock health. Here we tested the therapeutic ability of a paraprobiotic or dead probiotic that expresses the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry5B protein with known anthelmintic properties, against zoonotic Ascaris suum and Parascaris spp. This paraprobiotic, known as IBaCC, intoxicated A. suum larvae in vitro and was highly effective in vivo against intestinal A. suum infections in a new mouse model for this parasite. Fermentation was scaled up to 350 l to treat pigs and horses. Single dose Cry5B IBaCC nearly completely cleared A. suum infections in pigs. Furthermore, single dose Cry5B IBaCC drove fecal egg counts in Parascaris-infected foals to zero, showing at least parity with, and potential superiority to, current efficacy of anthelmintics used against this parasite.

We studied the effect of bioreactor operating condition variations on model parameters using impedance spectroscopy for biomass monitoring. The model parameters analyzed were capacitance, resistance, alpha (alpha), conductivity delta (sigma) and critical frequency (fc). These model parameters were obtained by fitting data from impedance measurements to an equivalent circuit model and Cole-Cole conductivity model. The effect of operating conditions on the medium with no cells was estimated by the percentage of change in each model parameter. The operating conditions with the most significant percentage of change were determined, by comparing to the percentage of change of the same model parameters obtained, during a fermentation of Bacillus thuringiensis as a cellular model. Equivalent circuit parameters were mainly affected by variation in pH, temperature and aeration, whereas Cole-Cole parameters were affected by variation in agitation, aeration, temperature and pH. Therefore, any variation in these operating conditions (within the test interval) during a fermentation may generate changes in monitoring parameters, which will not be a direct consequence of any change in the properties of the biomass.",1615-7605 (Electronic) 1615-7591 (Linking),2021 Apr 21,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1885-2901'],"['10.1007/s00449-021-02572-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00449-021-02572-0 [pii]']",['eng'],Germany,"['Bacillus thuringiensis', 'Bioreactors', 'Cole-Cole', 'Impedance spectroscopy', 'Operating conditions', 'Zarc circuit']",,,

Chemical insecticides have been intensively used to eliminate mosquito-borne diseases, resulting in the development of insecticide resistance. However, little is known about the insecticide resistance of mosquito populations in Lao PDR and the mechanisms responsible for it, which have important implications for vector management programs. Here, we examined the phenotypic and haplotypic profiles of insecticide resistance in populations of Ae. aegypti larvae from central Lao PDR. METHODS: Ae. aegypti larvae were collected from four sites in Lao PDR, and their susceptibility to temephos, deltamethrin, permethrin, and Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) was tested using larval bioassays. Synergistic tests were also conducted to evaluate the activity of insecticide-metabolizing enzymes in the larvae. Deltamethrin-resistant and Deltamethrin-susceptible larvae were then genotyped for knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations to determine the associations between each genotype and resistance. RESULTS: Ae. aegypti larvae from central Lao PDR were considered to be ""resistant"" (<98% mortality) to organophosphates and pyrethroids. The bio-insecticide Bti remains effective against such larvae. The resistance mechanisms of Ae. aegypti larvae were found to vary among populations, especially for pyrethroid resistance. Kdr mutations were significantly associated with deltamethrin resistance in Ae. aegypti from the Xaythany population. In contrast, synergist assays with piperonyl butoxide suggested that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases played an important role in the resistance seen in the Khounkham and Thakhek populations. CONCLUSION: This study obtained information that will aid the design and implementation of insecticide-based vector management of Ae. aegypti in central Lao PDR. Ae. aegypti larvae from central Lao PDR were highly susceptible to Bti, while they were resistant to temephos at a diagnostic dose of 0.0286 mg/L. Given the limited number of insecticides that are approved for vector control, it is important to alternate between temephos and other larvicides, such as Bti and pyriproxyfen. The differences in pyrethroid resistance mechanisms seen among the Ae. aegypti populations highlight the need to tailor vector-control strategies to each region to increase the success of dengue control in Lao PDR.",1348-8945 (Print) 1348-8945 (Linking),2021 Apr 21,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1797-3509'],"['10.1186/s41182-021-00321-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s41182-021-00321-3 [pii]']",['eng'],Japan,"['Aedes aegypti', 'Bioassay', 'Dengue', 'Insecticide resistance', 'Lao PDR', 'P450s', 'Synergist', 'kdr mutation']",,,

It shared the highest identity of 73% with the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 8 chitosanase from Bacillus thuringiensis JAM-GG01. The gene was heterologously expressed in Bacillus subtilis as an extracellular protein, and the highest chitosanase yield of 1, 108 U/mL was obtained by high-cell density fermentation in a 5-L fermentor. The recombinant chitosanase (PbCsn8) was purified to homogeneity and biochemically characterized. PbCsn8 was most active at pH 5.5 and 70 degrees C, respectively. It was stable in a wide pH range of 5.0-11.0 and up to 55 degrees C. PbCsn8 was a bifunctional enzyme, exhibiting both chitosanase and glucanase activities, with the highest specificity towards chitosan (360 U/mg), followed by barley beta-glucan (72 U/mg) and lichenan (13 U/mg). It hydrolyzed chitosan to release mainly chitooligosaccharides (COSs) with degree of polymerization (DP) 2-3, while hydrolyzed barley beta-glucan to yield mainly glucooligosaccharides with DP > 5. PbCsn8 was further applied in COS production, and the highest COS yield of 79.3% (w/w) was obtained. This is the first report on a GH family 8 chitosanase from P. barengoltzii.

Since Drosophila suzukii has invaded North America and Europe, the global production of soft, thin-skinned fruits has suffered severe losses. The control of this dipteran by pesticides, although commonly used, is not recommended because of the negative impact on the environment and human health. A possible alternative is the use of bio-insecticides, including Bacillus thuringiensis and entomopathogenic nematodes, such as Steinernema carpocapsae. These biological control agents have a fair effectiveness when used individually on D. suzukii, but both have limits related to different environmental, methodological, and physiological factors. In this work, we tested various concentrations of B. thuringiensis and S. carpocapsae to evaluate their efficacy on D. suzukii larvae, when administered individually or in combination by using agar traps. In the combined trials, we added the nematodes after 16 h or concurrently to the bacteria, and assessed larvae lethality from 16 to 48 h. The assays demonstrated a higher efficacy of the combined administration, both time-shifted and concurrent; the obtained data also showed a relevant decrease of the time needed to kill the larvae. Particularly, the maximum mortality rate, corresponding to 79% already at 16 h, was observed with the highest concentrations (0.564 microg/mL of B. thuringiensis and 8 x 10(2) IJs of S. carpocapsae) in the concurrent trials.

When iron levels are low, many bacteria including those of the Burkholderia cepacia group secrete chemically diverse siderophores to capture Fe(3+). The synthesis of the two main siderophores, ornibactin and pyochelin, is regulated in an iron concentration dependent manner via the regulator protein Fur. In this study, we identified a novel Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase (NRPS) cluster in strain R456 of Burkholderia seminalis, a member of the B. cepacia group. We show that the NRPS cluster not only allows the production of a so-far undescribed siderophore, but is also required for ornibactin and pyochelin production as it is a crucial component in the signaling pathway targeting the global iron regulating effector Fur which regulates siderophore production. Furthermore, the NRPS cluster is also involved in cell motility and biofilm formation, both of which are directly dependent on iron concentration in various bacteria. Interestingly, our data suggests that this newly discovered NRPS cluster which regulates siderophore iron metabolism in bacteria was obtained by horizontal gene transfer from algae.",1879-0003 (Electronic) 0141-8130 (Linking),2021 Apr 19,,"['S0141-8130(21)00803-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.051 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Burkholderia seminalis', 'HPLC-MS', 'Horizontal gene transfer', 'Iron', 'NRPS cluster', 'Siderophore']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, various kinds of enzyme species are abundantly found in seawater, some of which have been identified to exist in marine aerosols. Herein, from the perspective of marine aerosol interface simulation, we investigate the effect of Burkholderia cepacia lipase on the surface properties of stearic acid (SA) monolayer at the air-water interface by using surface-sensitive techniques of Langmuir trough and Infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS). Our findings indicate that the stearic acid film undergoes a significant expansion, especially when the lipase concentration is 500 nM, because of the incorporation of lipase as observed from the surface pressure-area (pi-A) isotherms. IRRAS spectra also show reduced intensities and ordering in the methylene stretching vibration region of stearic acid as a result of low surface density and disordered packing as the enzyme concentration increases. In particular, when the concentration of lipase is 500 nM, the lowest Ias/Is values are shown on both pure water subphase and artificial seawater subphase, indicating more gauche conformations for SA. Furthermore, SA films with lipase incorporation were also studied at three different pH of subphase environment, considering the decrease of pH caused by the reaction with acidic gases during the aerosol aging process. The results reflect a more pronounced expansion of SA monolayer in acidic environment at pH 2.5, suggesting that hydrophobic interaction plays an important role in the disorder of the SA monolayer. In view of the coexistence of fatty acids and enzymes in the marine environment, this study provides a further understanding of the surface organization and behavior of organic-coated marine aerosols and deepen the knowledge of lipid-enzyme interfacial interactions occurring in the atmosphere.",1879-1026 (Electronic) 0048-9697 (Linking),2021 Apr 5,,"['S0048-9697(21)01963-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146893 [doi]']",['eng'],Netherlands,"['Interfacial behavior', 'Langmuir monolayer', 'Lipase', 'Marine aerosol', 'Stearic acid']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This is the case of Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), a group of related bacteria able to cause infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. These bacteria use TAAs, among other virulence factors, to bind to host protein receptors and their carbohydrate ligands. Blocking such contacts is an attractive approach to inhibit Bcc infections. In this study, using an antibody produced against the TAA BCAM2418 from the epidemic strain Burkholderia cenocepacia K56-2, we were able to uncover its roles as an adhesin and the type of host glycan structures that serve as recognition targets. The neutralisation of BCAM2418 was found to cause a reduction in the adhesion of the bacteria to bronchial cells and mucins. Moreover, in vivo studies have shown that the anti-BCAM2418 antibody exerted an inhibitory effect during infection in Galleria mellonella. Finally, inferred by glycan arrays, we were able to predict for the first time, host glycan epitopes for a TAA. We show that BCAM2418 favoured binding to 3'sialyl-3-fucosyllactose, histo-blood group A, alpha-(1,2)-linked Fuc-containing structures, Lewis structures and GM1 gangliosides.

It is well known that chronic infections in CF patients have a significant impact on lung-function decline and survival before transplantation. The rate and timing of re-colonization after transplantation have been described, but the impact on survival after stratification of bacteria is not well elucidated. We did a single-center retrospective analysis of 99 consecutive CF patients who underwent lung transplantation since the beginning of the Copenhagen Lung Transplant program in 1992 until October 2014. Two patients were excluded due to re-transplantation. From the time of CF diagnosis, patients had monthly sputum cultures. After transplantation, CF-patients had bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage at 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks and 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after transplantation, as well as sputum samples if relevant. Selected culture results prior to and after transplantation were stored. We focused on colonization with the most frequent bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (AX) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to identify clonality of bacterial isolates obtained before and after lung transplantation. Time to re-colonization was defined as the time from transplantation to the first positive culture with the same species. Seventy-three out of 97 (75%) had sufficient culture data for analyses with a median of 7 (1-91) cultures available before and after transplantation. Median colonization-free survival time was 23 days until the first positive culture after transplantation. After 2 years, 59 patients (81%) were re-colonized, 33 (48.5%) with PA, 7 (10.3%) with SM, 12 (17.6%) with AX, and 7 (10.3%) with BCC. No difference in survival was observed between the patients colonized within the first 2 years and those not colonized.

Species identification allows a potential first adaptation of empiric antibiotic treatments before the resistance profile is available. Matrix assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a widely used method for bacterial species identification. However, important challenges in species identification remain. These arise from (i) incomplete databases, (ii) close relatedness of species of interest, and (iii) spectral quality, which is currently vaguely defined. Methods: We selected 47 clinically relevant bacterial isolates from 39 species, which can be challenging to identify by MALDI-TOF MS. We measured these isolates under various analytical conditions on two MALDI-TOF MS systems. First, we identified spectral features, which were associated with correct species identification in three different databases. Considering these features, we then systematically compared spectra produced with three different sample preparation protocols. In addition, we varied quantities of bacterial colony material applied and bacterial colony age. Results: We identified (i) the number of ribosomal marker peaks detected, (ii) the median relative intensity of ribosomal marker peaks, (iii) the sum of the intensity of all detected peaks, (iv) a high measurement precision, and (v) reproducibility of peaks to act as good proxies of spectral quality. We found that using formic acid, measuring bacterial colonies at a young age, and frequently calibrating the MALDI-TOF MS device increase mass spectral quality. We further observed significant differences in spectral quality between different bacterial taxa and optimal measurement conditions vary per taxon. Conclusion: We identified and applied quality measures for MALDI-TOF MS and optimized spectral quality in routine settings. Phylogenetic marker peaks can be reproducibly detected and provide an increased resolution and the ability to distinguish between challenging species such as those within the Enterobacter cloacae complex, Burkholderia cepacia complex, or viridans streptococci.",2235-2988 (Electronic) 2235-2988 (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fcimb.2021.646648 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry', 'microbial diagnostics', 'quality control', 'species identification', 'standardisation']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Cuenod, Foucault, Pfluger and Egli.']",,

The disease is known to persist for years together, leading to complications. A male patient aged 30 years with underlying HIV-2 infection presented to the department of STD with painful ulceration over the genital region of 5 months duration, with absence of penis. Tissue smear from the ulcer and histopathological examination revealed large histiocytes with intracellular Donovan bodies (Pund cell).

The population attributable risk of potentially treatable Cp infection in asthma has not been reported. METHODS: The author searched from 2000 to 2020 inclusive for previously un-reviewed and new cross sectional and prospective controlled studies of Cp biomarkers and chronic asthma in both children and adults. Qualitative descriptive results and quantitative estimates of population attributable risk for selected biomarkers (specific IgG, IgA and IgE) are presented. FINDINGS: No large, long-term prospective population-based studies of Cp infection and asthma were identified. About half of case-control studies reported one or more significant associations of Cp biomarkers and chronic asthma. Heterogeneity of results by age group (pediatric v adult asthma), severity category (severe/uncontrolled, moderate/partly controlled, mild/controlled) and antibody isotype (specific IgG, IgA, IgE) were suggested by the qualitative results and confirmed by meta-analyses. The population attributable risks for Cp-specific IgG and IgA were nul in children and were 6% (95% confidence interval 2%-10%, p = 0.002) and 13% (9%-18%, p<0.00001) respectively in adults. In contrast to the nul or small population attributable risks for Cp-specific IgG and IgA, the population attributable risk for C. pneumoniae-specific IgE (children and adults combined) was 47% (39%-55%, p<0.00001). In the subset of studies that reported on asthma severity categories, Cp biomarkers were positively and significantly (P<0.00001) associated with asthma severity. INTERPRETATION: C. pneumoniae-specific IgE is strongly associated with asthma and asthma severity, suggesting a possible mechanism linking chronic Cp infection with asthma in a subset of individuals with asthma. Infection biomarkers should be included in future macrolide treatment trials for severe and uncontrolled asthma.",1932-6203 (Electronic) 1932-6203 (Linking),2021,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8369-5829'],"['10.1371/journal.pone.0250034 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-01319 [pii]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

C. psittaci infects a broad range of hosts; strains are isolated not only from birds but also from mammals, where they seem to have a reduced infectious and zoonotic potential. Comparative analysis of chlamydial genomes revealed the coding sequences of polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmps) to be highly variable regions. Pmps are characterized as adhesins in C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae and are immunoreactive proteins in several Chlamydia species. Thus, Pmps are considered to be associated with tissue tropism and pathogenicity. C. psittaci harbors 21 Pmps. We hypothesize that the different infectious potential and host tropism of avian and mammalian C. psittaci strains is dependent on differences in their Pmp repertoires. In this study, we experimentally confirmed the different virulence of avian and mammalian strains, by testing the survival rate of infected embryonated eggs and chlamydiae dissemination in the embryos. Further, we investigated the possible involvement of Pmps in host tropism. Analysis of pmp sequences from 10 C. psittaci strains confirmed a high degree of variation, but no correlation with host tropism was identified. However, comparison of Pmp expression profiles from different strains showed that Pmps of the G group are the most variably expressed, also among avian and mammalian strains. To investigate their functions, selected Pmps were recombinantly produced from one avian and one mammalian representative strain and their adhesion abilities and relevance for the infection of C. psittaci strains in avian and mammalian cells were tested. For the first time, we identified Pmp22D, Pmp8G, and OmcB as relevant adhesins, essential during infection of C. psittaci strains in general. Moreover, we propose Pmp17G as a possible key player for host adaptation, as it could only bind to and influence the infection in avian cells, but it had no relevant impact towards infection in mammalian cells. These data support the hypothesis that distinct Pmp repertoires in combination with specific host factors may contribute to host tropism of C. psittaci strains.",1664-302X (Print) 1664-302X (Linking),2021,,['10.3389/fmicb.2021.656209 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['Chlamydia psittaci', 'adhesion', 'avian strain', 'egg model', 'infectious potential', 'mammalian strain', 'polymorphic membrane proteins', 'virulence']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Favaroni, Trinks, Weber, Hegemann and Schnee.']",,

In the Australian Capital Territory, there is limited information on how seasonal patterns for positive infections and testing may vary, a gap that has implications for control strategies. Methods: We examined seasonal patterns of immunoassay results of patients from Canberra Hospital, Australia, who were tested for Cp and/or Myco. Pathology data, collected from August 1997 to March 2007 from 7,275 patients, were analysed with time series additive decomposition and time series regression. Results: The proportion of positive Cp infections was highest in March and April (autumn) and lowest in June and August (winter). The proportion of positive Myco infections was highest in December and January (summer) and lowest in August (winter), even though testing for the pathogen peaked in winter with a low in summer. Models with a long-term trend and a variable for month were a better fit for the data than the null models for both infections. Conclusion: We found differences in seasonal patterns of testing and in the proportion of positive infections.

Thus, we investigated whether fluticasone propionate (FP) or budesonide (BUD) could affect C. pneumoniae infection in vitro and in vivo, focusing on the possible mechanisms that lead to potential anti-chlamydial outcomes. We performed direct qPCR to detect C. pneumoniae growth in infected, FP-treated, and BUD-treated A549 cells. Furthermore, FP or BUD was administered by inhalation to C. pneumoniae-infected mice. The recoverable C. pneumoniae was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Expression levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma and IFN-gamma inducible chemokines were assessed by qPCR. We measured the protein concentrations of IFN-gamma and of other cytokines that potentially participate in the anti-chlamydial response by ELISA. We found that FP treatment suppressed Chlamydia growth in A549 cells and in mice. Higher levels of IFN-gamma gene expression were observed in FP-treated mice compared to the untreated and BUD-treated mice (p < 0.0001). IFN-gamma and anti-chlamydial protein MIG/CXCL9 values were significantly higher after FP inhalation.

GENECUBE (TOYOBO) is a novel fully automated gene analyzer capable of amplifying and detecting target DNAs within 50 min. In this study, we developed a new PCR assay with a specific quenching probe (PCR-QC assay) for rapidly distinguishing between Chlamydia pneumoniae (CPN) and Chlamydia psittaci (CPS). The PCR-QC assay enabled us to precisely and simultaneously detect the 2 different types of DNA fragments even in a mixed sample by identifying unique melting temperatures. Next, we examined a total of 300 frozen samples from patients with respiratory tract infection using the PCR-QC assay and the cell culture method as the gold standard. Kappa index for agreement between the PCR-QC assay and the culture method was 0.43 (95% confidential interval (CI): 0.08-0.78).

METHODS: Conjunctival-choanal-cloacal swabs were collected from apparently healthy captive wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos; n=114) and paradise shelducks (Tadorna variegata; n=10) temporarily housed at a waterfowl breeding and rehabilitation facility (Wellington, NZ) and from wild mallards in Palmerston North (n=50), and Southland (n=50). DNA extracted from the swabs was analysed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) high-resolution melt curve (HRM) analysis, targeting the ompA gene of C. psittaci. RESULTS: Of the captive waterfowl, 39/114 (34%) mallards and 6/10 (60%) paradise shelducks were positive for C. psittaci as were 24/100 (24%) of wild mallards. All wild mallards and paradise shelducks carried only C. psittaci genotype C. In captive wild mallards, genotypes A and C, and a mixed infection of both genotypes were found. Captive wild mallards and paradise shelducks were found to be shedding 4 to 5x10(4) and 1x10(5) to 4x10(5) copies of C. psittaci DNA per swab respectively, with wild mallards shedding 4-677 DNA copies/swab. CONCLUSIONS: Based on qPCR-HRM analysis, a high proportion of wild mallards were infected with of C. psittaci but these birds were shedding only low amounts of bacterial DNA. The proportion of sampled ducks of infected and amount of bacterial shedding were higher in the birds in a wildlife rehabilitation facility. The major C. psittaci genotype found in the mallards and paradise shelducks was genotype C. This is the first detection of C. psittaci genotype A and co-infection of genotype A and C in ducks. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results indicate that mallards are a reservoir of C. psittaci and therefore may pose a zoonotic risk to people involved in duck hunting, wildlife care and recreational duck feeding.

The incidence of MZL increased +1.0% per year in the US from 2001-2017, with increases reported in other countries during this timeframe. The 5-year relative survival rate for MZL in the US was 89.8% and was similar across racial/ethnic groups and by sex; survival rates have been increasing in the US and other countries. Established risk factors for MZL (or MZL subtypes) include family history of NHL, genetic loci in the HLA region, Helicobacter pylori infection (gastric MALT lymphoma), and several autoimmune diseases (Sjogren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and Hashimoto thyroiditis), with strong (but not definitive) evidence for Chlamydia psittaci (ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma), Borrelia burgdorferi (cutaneous MZL), hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and solid organ transplantation. Promising risk factors that require additional study include other infections, other autoimmune conditions, trichloroethylene exposure, certain occupations, hair dye, cigarette smoking, sun exposure (protective), and alcohol use (protective). MZL is a model of an antigen-driven malignancy, where epidemiologic risk factors, tissue-specific factors, and host immune response (including the impact of chronic inflammation and immunosuppression) drive lymphomagenesis with implications for prevention.",,2021 Mar,,['10.21037/aol-20-28 [doi]'],['eng'],China,"['epidemiology', 'genetics', 'incidence', 'marginal zone lymphoma', 'risk factors']",,,

Moreover, Ehrlichia minasensis has also recently been identified as a novel ehrlichial agent that infects cattle in Brazil. The objective of this study was to determine whether dogs could be infected by E. minasensis. To investigate this possibility, sera (n=429) collected from dogs in the Pantanal region were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of antibodies against E. canis and E. minasensis. Canine sera were screened by two isolates of E. canis in indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and the majority (n=298; 69.4%) had antibodies with endpoint titers ranging from 80 to 327,680. In order to further confirm E. canis-specific antibodies, IFA positive sera were analyzed by ELISA using E. canis-specific peptides (i.e. TRP19 and TRP36 US/BR/CR), which detected E. canis antibodies in 80.2% (239/298) of the dog sera. Fifty-nine (13.7%) samples had detectable antibodies to E. canis by IFA but were negative by E. canis peptide ELISA. These sera were then tested by E. minasensis IFA (Cuiaba strain) as antigen and 67.8% (40/59) were positive (titers ranging from 80 to 20,480). Eleven sera had antibody titers against E. minasensis at least two-fold higher than observed for E. canis and suggests that these dogs were previously infected with E. minasensis. The results of the present study suggest that multiple ehrlichial agents infect dogs in Brazil, which highlights the need to consider different Ehrlichia spp. in Brazilian dogs, particularly in areas where dogs are frequently exposed to multiple tick species.

Available canine IF targets were IgG-FC, IgA, IgM, light chain (LC), IgG4, and free LC (fLC) antibodies. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review specific features associated with the presence of M-proteins in canine serum samples and the common features causing inaccurate reporting of M-proteins to improve the diagnostic performance of routine electrophoresis and IF for the detection of M-proteins. METHODS: Features found in AGE, CZE, routine IF, IgG4 IF, and fLC IF of 100 canine serum samples from Part 1 of this study were evaluated by simple and multivariate logistic regression to identify factors associated with the presence of M-proteins. Cases falsely called negative or positive for M-proteins were reviewed to identify the common features that could be used to increase the diagnostic performance of SPE and IF for M-protein detection. RESULTS: The presence of hypogammaglobulinemia or any peak taller than albumin was associated with an M-protein. Total protein concentrations, globulin concentrations, or peaks wider than albumin were not associated with an M-protein. Free LC sMRD cases were not diagnosed by SPE and routine IF. Cases with infectious and inflammatory etiologies had a restricted polyclonal gammopathy with multiple gamma-globulin restrictions resulting in some false-positive results. SPE combined with all available IF results and the specific features identified in this study had an estimated sensitivity of 95.1% and specificity of 81.4%.

NADH respiration in isolated membrane particles were partially inhibited by rotenone, dicoumarol, quinacrine, flavone, and capsaicin. A similar response was obtained when succinate oxidation was performed in the presence of thenoyltrifluoroacetone and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. NADH respiration was resistant to site II inhibitors and cyanide, indicating that a percentage of the electrons transported can reach O2 without the bc1 complex. Succinate respiration was sensitive to myxothiazol, antimycin A and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO). Juglone, plumbagin and menadione had higher reactivity with NADH dehydrogenase. The membrane particles showed the highest oxidase activities with ascorbate-TCHQ (tetrachlorohydroquinone), TCHQ alone, and NADH-TMPD (N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine), and minor activity levels with ascorbate-DCPIP (2,6-dichloro-phenolindophenol) and NADH-DCPIP.

The etiological epidemiology in Peru is scarce, even though some studies describe a prevalence of 48.5% of periodontal disease in the general population. Periodontitis is one of the most prevalent oral diseases associated with site-specific changes in the oral microbiota and it has been associated with a socioeconomic state. This study aimed to determine the etiology and resistance profile of bacteria identified in a group of Peruvian patients with periodontal disease. Methods: Six subgingival plaque samples were collected from eight patients with severe periodontitis. Bacterial identification was carried out by an initial culture, PCR amplification, and subsequently DNA sequencing. We evaluated the antibiotic susceptibility by the disk diffusion method. Results: Variable diversity in oral microbiota was identified in each one of the eight patients. The bacterial genus most frequently found was Streptococcus spp. (15/48, 31.3%) followed by Rothia spp. (11/48, 22.9%), Actinomyces spp. (9/48, 18.8%), and Eikenella spp. (4/48, 8.3%). The most common species found was Rothia dentocariosa (8/48, 16.7%). The antimicrobial susceptibility assay varied according to the species tested; however, among all the isolates evaluated, Actinomyces naeslundii was resistant to penicillin and tetracycline; Eikenella corrodens was resistant to dicloxacillin; and Rothia dentocariosa was resistant to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and metronidazole but also susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Conclusions: The most prevalent periodontal bacterium found in this study was Rothia dentocariosa.

Within this genus is Cardiobacterium valvarum (C. valvarum), a novel organism described in 2004. To date, only 15 cases of C. valvarum infection have been reported in the English-language literature, and have primarily been cases of infective endocarditis in patients with valvular disease. C. valvarum has not been reported to cause infections spreading to the surrounding bone. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 57-year-old man with a history of aortic dissection followed by aortic endograft replacement who presented with back pain. He was found to have radiographic evidence of an infected aortic endograft, along with vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, and epidural phlegmon. Blood cultures identified C. valvarum as the causative organism. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and surgical intervention was deferred due to the patient's complex anatomy. His course was complicated by septic cerebral emboli resulting in cerebrovascular accident. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights C. valvarum, a rare and emerging HACEK group microorganism that warrants consideration in high-risk patients with evidence of subacute infection and disseminated disease.

METHODS: Based on clinical examinations, 87 subjects were divided into a healthy group (n=40) and a periodontitis group (n=47). Clinical measurements were obtained from all subjects including periodontal probing depth (PD), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and the plaque index. Saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) as a subgingival bacterial sample were sampled before and 3 months after periodontal therapy. The salivary and subgingival bacterial samples were analyzed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to quantify the following 11 periodontal pathogens: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythus (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Pavimonas micra (Pm), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), Prevotella nigrescens (Pn), Eikenella corrodens (Ec), and Eubacterium nodatum (En).

We aimed to investigate the performance and reliability of machine learning models in predicting the severity of chronic periodontitis. Mouthwash samples from 692 subjects (144 healthy controls and 548 generalized chronic periodontitis patients) were collected, the genomic DNA was isolated, and the copy numbers of nine pathogens were measured using multiplex qPCR. The nine pathogens are as follows: Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Tannerella forsythia (Tf), Treponema denticola (Td), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (Pa), and Eikenella corrodens (Ec). By adding the species one by one in order of high accuracy to find the optimal combination of input features, we developed an algorithm that predicts the severity of periodontitis using four machine learning techniques. The accuracy was the highest when the models classified ""healthy"" and ""moderate or severe"" periodontitis (H vs. M-S, average accuracy of four models: 0.93, AUC = 0.96, sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.81, and diagnostic odds ratio = 112.75). One or two red complex pathogens were used in three models to distinguish slight chronic periodontitis patients from healthy controls (average accuracy of 0.78, AUC = 0.82, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.84, diagnostic odds ratio = 12.85). Although the overall accuracy was slightly reduced, the models showed reliability in predicting the severity of chronic periodontitis from 45 newly obtained samples.

METHODS: Fifteen patients in mixed dentition treated with a bonded palatal expander were enrolled in this longitudinal study. Saliva samples were taken before the therapy, as well as in 2 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the beginning of the therapy. In each sample, the levels of MRP-8/14 were determined by ELISA and the presence of 11 bacteria was detected by PCR followed by DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Salivary concentration of MRP-8/14 and the amount of Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Eikenella corrodens were significantly increased during treatment with bonded maxillary expander. These changes were transient and the maximal levels of MRP-8/14 and periodontitis-associated pathogens were observed 6-9 months after the beginning of the therapy. CONCLUSION: Therapy with bonded maxillary results in higher MRP-8/14 levels and increased prevalence of some periodontitis-associated bacteria, namely T. forsythia, T. denticola, and E. corrodens.

Although evidence of their broad antimicrobial, antibiofilm and immunomodulatory activities in mammals have been presented, beta-defensins from other vertebrate species, like crocodylians, remain largely unexplored. In this study, five new crocodylian beta-defensin variants from Alligator mississippiensis and Crocodylus porosus were selected for synthesis and characterization based on their charge and hydrophobicity values. Linear peptides were synthesized, folded, purified and then evaluated for their antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against the bacterial pathogens, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Am23SK variant (SCRFSGGYCIWNWERCRSGHFLVALCPFRKRCCK) from A. mississippiensis displayed promising activity against both planktonic cells and bacterial biofilms, outperforming the human beta-defensin 3 under the experimental conditions. Moreover, Am23SK exhibited no cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells and exerted immunomodulatory effects in vitro, moderately suppressing the production of proinflammatory mediators from stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells.

Beyond cardiovascular risk factors associated with age, some young adults without medical or cardiovascular history had stroke as a presenting feature of Covid-19. Suggested stroke mechanisms in this setting are inflammatory storm, subsequent hypercoagulability, and vasculitis. To date, a handful of pediatric stroke cases associated with Covid-19 have been reported, either with a cardioembolic mechanism or a focal cerebral arteriopathy. We report the case of an adolescent who presented with febrile meningism and stupor. Clinical, biological, and radiological features favored the diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome (LS), with Fusobacterium necrophorum infection (sphenoid sinusitis and meningitis) and intracranial vasculitis. The patient had concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite medical and surgical antimicrobial treatment, stroke prevention, and venous thrombosis prevention, he presented with severe cerebrovascular complications. Venous thrombosis and stroke were observed, with an extension of intracranial vasculitis, and lead to death. As both F. necrophorum and SARS-CoV-2 enhance inflammation, coagulation, and activate endothelial cells, we discuss how this coinfection may have potentiated and aggravated the usual course of LS. The potentiation by SARS-CoV-2 of vascular and thrombotic effects of a bacterial infection may represent an underreported cerebrovascular injury mechanism in Covid-19 patients. These findings emphasize the variety of mechanisms underlying stroke in this disease.

Culture-based studies have identified Fusobacterium necrophorum as the primary causative agent, but a number of other bacterial species are frequently isolated. The incidence of liver abscesses is highly variable and is affected by a number of factors, including cattle type. Holstein steers raised for beef production have a higher incidence than crossbred feedlot cattle. Tylosin is the commonly used antimicrobial feed additive to reduce the incidence of liver abscesses. The objective of this study was to utilize 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequence analyses to analyze the bacterial community composition of purulent material of liver abscesses of crossbred cattle (n = 24) and Holstein steers (n = 24), each fed finishing diet with or without tylosin. DNA was extracted and the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. The minimum, mean, and maximum sequence reads per sample were 996, 177,070, and 877,770, respectively, across all the liver abscess samples. Sequence analyses identified 5 phyla, 14 families, 98 genera, and 102 amplicon sequence variants (ASV) in the 4 treatment groups. The dominant phyla identified were Fusobacteria (52% of total reads) and Proteobacteria (33%). Of the top 25 genera identified, 17 genera were Gram negative and 8 were Gram positive. The top 3 genera, which accounted for 75% of the total reads, in the order of abundance, were Fusobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides. The relative abundance, expressed as percent of total reads, of phyla, family, and genera did not differ (P > 0.05) between the 4 treatment groups. Generic richness and evenness, determined by Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's diversity indices, respectively, did not differ between the groups. The UniFrac distance matrices data revealed no clustering of the ASV indicating variance between the samples within each treatment group. Co-occurrence network analysis at the genus level indicated a strong association of Fusobacterium with 15 other genera, and not all of them have been previously isolated from liver abscesses.

The bacterium, a member of the microbial community of the rumen, travels to the liver via portal circulation to cause abscesses. The severity of liver abscesses vary from mild with one or two small abscesses to severe with medium to large multiple abscesses. Leukotoxin, a secreted protein, is the critical virulence factor involved in the infection. Our objective was to compare leukotoxin production between strains of F. necrophorum isolated from mild and severe liver abscesses collected from slaughtered cattle. The quantification of leukotoxin was based on assays to measure cytotoxicity and protein antigen concentration. One-hundred strains, 50 from mild and 50 from severe abscesses, were utilized in the study. Cell-free supernatants were prepared from cultures grown in anaerobic broth at 9 and 24 h incubations. The leukotoxic activity was quantified by measuring cytotoxicity based on the release of lactic dehydrogenase from bovine lymphocyte cells, BL3, treated with the culture supernatant. Leukotoxin protein concentration was quantified by a sandwich ELISA assay with a leukotoxin-specific monoclonal antibody as the capture antibody. The leukotoxin activity and concentration were highly variable among the strains within each severity of liver abscesses. Although the leukotoxic activity was unaffected by incubation time, leukotoxin protein concentration was consistently higher at 24 h compared to 9 h incubation. Strains from severe liver abscesses had significantly higher leukotoxic activity and higher protein concentration compared to strains from mild liver abscesses (P < 0.0001) at both 9 and 24 h culture supernatants. Across all strains, the correlation coefficients between leukotoxic activity and leukotoxin concentration at 9 and 24 h were 0.14 (P = 0.17) and 0.47 (P < 0.0001), respectively. In conclusion, strains isolated from severe liver abscesses had significantly higher leukotoxic activities and leukotoxin protein concentrations compared to strains isolated from mild liver abscesses.",1095-8274 (Electronic) 1075-9964 (Linking),2021 Feb 12,,"['S1075-9964(21)00027-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anaerobe.2021.102344 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['Cattle', 'Fusobacterium necrophorum', 'Leukotoxin', 'Liver abscesses', 'Quantification']",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

It was described that E. coli harbouring polyketide synthase (pks) genes can synthetize bacterial toxin colibactin, which was first described by Nougayrede s group in 2006. E. coli positive for pks genes were overrepresented in colorectal cancer biopsies and, therefore, prevalence and the effect of pks positive bacteria as a risk factor in colorectal cancer development is in our interest. Interestingly, pks gene cluster in E. coli shares a striking 100% sequence identity with K. pneumoniae, suggesting that their function and regulation are conserved. Moreover, K. pneumoniae can express a variety of virulence factors, including capsules, siderophores, iron-scavenging systems, adhesins and endotoxins. It was reported that pks cluster and thereby colibactin is also related to the hypervirulence of K. pneumoniae. Acquisition of the pks locus is associated with K. pneumoniae gut colonisation and mucosal invasion. Colibactin also increases the likelihood of serious complications of bacterial infections, such as development of meningitis and potentially tumorigenesis. Even though K. pneumoniae is undoubtedly a gut colonizer, the role of pks positive K. pneumoniae in GIT has not yet been investigated. It seems that CRC-distinctive microbiota is already present in the early stages of cancer development and, therefore, microbiome analysis could help to discover the early stages of cancer, which are crucial for effectiveness of anticancer therapy.

In the current study, pharmacoinformatics approaches including quantum chemistry methods, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations have been utilized to identify selective Leishmania donovani DHFR (LdDHFR) inhibitors. Initially, for the design of new LdDHFR inhibitors, a virtual combinatorial library was created by considering various head groups (scaffolds), linkers and tail groups. The scaffolds utilized in the library design were selected on the basis of their proton affinity (PA) estimated using quantum chemical methods, required to make a strong H-bond interaction with negatively charged LdDHFR active site. Later on, molecular docking-based virtual screening was performed to screen the designed library. Selectivity of the chosen hits toward the LdDHFR was established through re-docking in the human DHFR enzyme (HsDHFR). Best five hits were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to validate their selectivity as well as stability in LdDHFR. Out of the five hits, four were found to be energetically more favorable and promising for selective binding toward LdDHFR in comparison to HsDHFR.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

KEY FINDINGS: Six hundred and sixteen papers were evaluated, and 88 studies reporting data on 3108 cases of leishmaniasis (2082 patients with tegumentary leishmaniasis and 1026 with visceral leishmaniasis) were finally included. The majority of available studies were on New World cutaneous leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania donovani. At the same time, few data are available for Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis, mucosal leishmaniasis, and visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum. Pooled cure rate for tegumentary leishmaniasis was 78.8% (CI95% 76.9-80.6%) and 92.7% (CI95% 88.3-97.1%) according to controlled randomized trial and observational studies and case report and case series respectively. Pooled cure rate for visceral leishmaniasis was 84.8% (CI95% 82.6-87.1%) and 90.7% (CI95% 84.1-97.3%) according to controlled randomized trial and observational studies and case report and case series respectively. Comparable cure rate was observed in recurrent and refractory cases of visceral leishmaniasis. Concerning the safety profile, among almost 2000 treated subjects with some available information, the most relevant side effects were six cases of arrhythmia (including four cases of fatal ventricular fibrillation), 20 cases of irreversible diabetes, 26 cases of muscular aseptic abscess following intramuscular administration. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: Pentamidine isethionate is associated with a similar cure rate of the first line antileishmanial drugs. Severe and irreversible adverse effect appear to be rare. The drug may still have a role in the treatment of any form of human leishmaniasis when the first-line option has failed or in patients who cannot tolerate other drugs also in the context of travellers or migrants.

This has led to the search for a suitable drug target for chemotherapeutic intervention. Potassium channels are a family of membrane proteins which play a vital role in homeostasis and any perturbation in them alters cell survival which makes them an attractive target. To characterize a calcium-activated potassium channel from Leishmania donovani (LdKCa), a putative ion-channel like protein which showed sequence similarity with other Trypanosoma cruzi putative potassium channels was selected. It was cloned and expressed with a histidine tag. MALDI confirmed that it is a potassium channel. Homology model of LdKCa was generated by I-TASSER. It is a transmembrane protein localized in the plasma membrane as predicted by DeepLoc tool. In silico analyses of the protein showed that it is a small conductance calcium activated potassium channel. Point mutation in conserved signature domain 'TXGYGD' affects the protein function as predicted by heat map analysis. The LdKCa model predicted amino acids S207, T208 and M236 as ligand-binding sites. The sequence HSLRGRSARVIQLAWRLRKARKVGPHAPSLKQKVYTLVLSWLLT was the highest scoring B-cell epitope.

These professional vacuolar pathogens are transmitted by infected sand flies to mammalian hosts as metacyclic promastigotes and are rapidly internalized by various phagocyte populations. Classical monocytes are among the first myeloid cells to migrate to infection sites. Recent evidence shows that recruitment of these cells contributes to parasite burden and to the establishment of chronic disease. However, the nature of Leishmania-inflammatory monocyte interactions during the early stages of host infection has not been well investigated. Here, we aimed to assess the impact of Leishmania donovani metacyclic promastigotes on antimicrobial responses within these cells. Our data showed that inflammatory monocytes are readily colonized by L. donovani metacyclic promastigotes, while infection with Escherichia coli is efficiently cleared. Upon internalization, metacyclic promastigotes inhibited superoxide production at the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) through a mechanism involving exclusion of NADPH oxidase subunits gp91 (phox) and p47 (phox) from the PV membrane. Moreover, we observed that unlike phagosomes enclosing zymosan particles, vacuoles containing parasites acidify poorly. Interestingly, whereas the parasite surface coat virulence glycolipid lipophosphoglycan (LPG) was responsible for the inhibition of PV acidification, impairment of the NADPH oxidase assembly was independent of LPG and GP63. Collectively, these observations indicate that permissiveness of inflammatory monocytes to L. donovani may thus be related to the ability of this parasite to impair the microbicidal properties of phagosomes.",1098-5522 (Electronic) 0019-9567 (Linking),2021 Apr 19,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1216-2571', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0633-5309']","['IAI.00009-21 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.00009-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society for Microbiology.'],,

Fifty-six Leishmania strains, isolated from 1981 to 2018, were analysed using MLEE, gene sequencing (hsp70, rpoIILS, fh and ITS2) and MALDI-TOF. The utility of these different analytical methods was compared. The results showed an increase in leishmaniasis over the two last decades, particularly imported cases, which represented 39% of all cases studied. L. infantum, L. major, L. tropica, L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis and L. panamensis were identified. The combination of molecular and enzymatic methods allowed the identification of 29 different strain types (A to AC). Strain diversity was higher in L. (Viannia), whilst the different L. major types were relatable with geo-temporal data. Among the autochthonous cases, type C prevailed throughout the studied period (39%). Minor types generally appeared within a short time interval.

Towards this goal, we first confirmed that EGCG inhibits L. infantum promastigote proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Second, we established that the leishmanicidal effect of EGCG was associated with i) mitochondria depolarization and ii) decreased concentration of intracellular ATP, and iii) increased concentration of intracellular H2O2. Third, we found that the leishmanicidal effect and the elevated H2O2 levels induced by of EGCG can be abolished by PEG-catalase, strongly suggesting that this flavonoid kills L. infantum promastigotes by disturbing their intracellular redox balance.

Leishmania (L.) donovani causes visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar), the most severe of these diseases. Along their biological cycle, Leishmania parasites undergo distinct developmental transitions including metacyclogenesis and differentiation of metacyclic promastigotes (MPs) to amastigotes. Metacyclogenesis inside the phlebotomine sandfly host's midgut converts the procyclic dividing promastigotes to non-dividing infective MPs eventually injected into the skin of mammalian hosts and phagocytosed by macrophages where the MPs are converted inside modified phagolysosomes to the intracellular amastigotes. These developmental transitions involve dramatic changes in cell size and shape and reformatting of the flagellum requiring thus membrane and cytoskeleton remodeling in which phosphoinositide (PI) signaling and metabolism must play central roles. This study reports on the LDBPK_220120.1 gene, the L. donovani ortholog of LmjF.22.0250 from L. major that encodes a phosphatase from the ""Atypical Lipid Phosphatases"" (ALPs) enzyme family. We confirmed the expression of the LDBPK_220120.1 gene product in both L. donovani promastigotes and axenic amastigotes and showed that it behaves in vitro as a Dual Specificity P-Tyr and monophosphorylated [PI(3)P and PI(4)P] PI phosphatase and therefore named it LdTyrPIP_22 (Leishmaniad onovani Tyrosine PI Phosphatase, gene locus at chromosome 22).

The laboratory assays used were the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) adopting a panel of polyclonal antisera against Leptospira spp. for serogrouping the isolates, DNA sequencing (secY) and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). The isolates belonged to five species: 20/52 were identified as L. borgpetersenii (38.5 %); 18/52 as L. kirschneri (34.6 %); 9/52 as L. santarosai (17.3 %); 3/52 as L. noguchii (5.8 %) and 2/52 as L. interrogans (3.8 %). With serogrouping, nine different serogroups were detected, with a high frequency of the Sejroe serogroup. MLVA showed that all L. borgpetersenii isolates had a profile compatible with serovar Hardjo; moreover, the other isolates demonstrated a diversity of patterns, and some of them may represent strains not yet characterized. In the Brazilian Amazon, the leptospires circulating in cattle revealed the unique aspects of infections in this area which, in addition to a variety of strains, were characterized by a high frequency of the Sejroe serogroup, highlighting the serovar Hardjo, which has not been reported in other regions of Brazil.",1878-1667 (Electronic) 0147-9571 (Linking),2021 Feb,,"['S0147-9571(20)30168-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cimid.2020.101579 [doi]']",['eng'],England,"['Brazilian Amazon', 'Cattle', 'Characterization', 'Leptospira', 'Sejroe']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In Spain, leptospirosis reports in people and animals have increased lately. Cats can become infected with Leptospira, as well as be chronic carriers. The aim of this study was to determine serological antibody prevalence against Leptospira sp., blood DNA, and shedding of DNA from pathogenic Leptospira species in the urine of cats in Spain. Microagglutination tests (MAT) and blood and urine TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed. Leptospira antibodies were detected in 10/244 cats; with 4.1% positive results (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-7.18%). Titers ranged from 1:20 to 1:320 (serovars Ballum; Bataviae; Bratislava; Cynopteri; Grippotyphosa Mandemakers; Grippotyphosa Moskva; Pomona; and Proechimys). The most common serovar was Cynopteri. Blood samples from 1/89 cats amplified for Leptospira DNA (1.12%; 95% CI: 0.05-5.41%). Urine samples from 4/232 cats amplified for Leptospira DNA (1.72%; 95% CI: 0.55-4.10%). In conclusion free-roaming cats in Spain can shed pathogenic Leptospira DNA in their urine and may be a source of human infection. Serovars not previously described in cats in Spain were detected; suggesting the presence of at least 4 different species of pathogenic leptospires in the country (L. borgpetersenii; L. interrogans; L. kirschneri; and L. noguchii).",1660-4601 (Electronic) 1660-4601 (Linking),2020 Mar 2,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7630-6116', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9799-9804']","['ijerph17051600 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph17051600 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['*PCR', '*antibodies', '*free-roaming cat', '*leptospirosis', '*serovar', '*shedding', '*zoonoses']",,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)']","['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial', '*Cats/microbiology', 'DNA, Bacterial', 'Female', '*Leptospira/isolation & purification', '*Leptospirosis', 'Male', 'Serogroup', 'Spain']"

In this study, we describe serological (MAT) and molecular characterization (rrs and secY gene sequencing, multilocus sequence typing [MLST] and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE]) of eight L. noguchii strains obtained from slaughtered cows. Intraspecific genetic diversity was evaluated, and haplotype networks were constructed based on hosts and geographical localizations. Strains were characterized as belonging to serogroups Australis, Autumnalis and Panama, and molecular characterization showed a high heterogeneity of these strains. Ten different STs were found (including nine new STs and 39 novel alleles) as well as nine different pulsotypes. Two clonal complexes were found. Phylogenetic trees based on secY locus and concatenated MLST loci showed two main clusters, with sequences from the present study included in the first. In general, there was no relationship between the geographical origin and the secY phylogenetic clusters, as well as between secY phylogenetic clusters and serogroups. Molecular diversity indexes confirmed a high variability (H > 0.8). This high intraspecific variation observed may be related to differences in virulence, pathogenicity and antigenicity or even adaptability of the strains. In addition, haplotype networks clearly demonstrated the circulation of genotypes between humans and animals, confirming the zoonotic potential.

The causative agents are spirochete bacteria of the Leptospira genus, displaying huge diversity of serovars, the identity of which is critical for effective diagnosis and vaccination purposes. Among many other mammalian species, Leptospira infects cattle, eliciting acute signs in calves, and chronic disease in adult animals often leading to abortions. In South America, and including in Uruguay, beef and dairy export are leading sources of national income. Despite the importance of bovine health, food safety, and bovine-related dissemination of leptospirosis to humans, extremely limited information is available as to the identity of Leptospira species and serovars infecting cattle in Uruguay and the South American subcontinent. Here we report a multicentric 3-year study resulting in the isolation and detailed characterization of 40 strains of Leptospira spp. obtained from infected cattle. Combined serologic and molecular typing identified these isolates as L. interrogans serogroup Pomona serovar Kennewicki (20 strains), L. interrogans serogroup Canicola serovar Canicola (1 strain), L. borgpetersenii serogroup Sejroe serovar Hardjo (10 strains) and L. noguchii (9 strains). The latter showed remarkable phenotypic and genetic variability, belonging to 6 distinct serogroups, including 3 that did not react with a large panel of reference serogrouping antisera. Approximately 20% of cattle sampled in the field were found to be shedding pathogenic Leptospira in their urine, uncovering a threat for public health that is being largely neglected.

The evidence that this corresponds to clearance of potentially infectious tuberculous mycobacteria in sputum is not well established. This World Health Organization-commissioned review investigated sputum sterilisation dynamics during TB treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: For the main analysis, 2 systematic literature searches of OvidSP MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus were conducted to identify studies with data on TB infectiousness (all studies to search date, 1 December 2017) and all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for drug-susceptible TB (from 1 January 1990 to search date, 20 February 2018). Included articles reported on patients receiving effective treatment for culture-confirmed drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. The outcome of interest was sputum bacteriological conversion: the proportion of patients having converted by a defined time point or a summary measure of time to conversion, assessed by smear or culture. Any study design where more than 10 participants were included was considered. Record sifting and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Random effects meta-analyses were performed. A narrative summary additionally describes the results of a systematic search for data evaluating infectiousness from humans to experimental animals (PubMed, all studies to 27 March 2018). Other evidence on duration of infectiousness-including studies reporting on cough dynamics, human tuberculin skin test conversion, or early bactericidal activity of TB treatments-was outside the scope of this review. The literature search was repeated on 22 November 2020, at the request of the editors, to identify studies published after the previous censor date. Four small studies reporting 3 different outcome measures were identified, which included no data that would alter the findings of the review; they are not included in the meta-analyses. Of 5,290 identified records, 44 were included. Twenty-seven (61%) were RCTs and 17 (39%) were cohort studies. Thirteen studies (30%) reported data from Africa, 12 (27%) from Asia, 6 (14%) from South America, 5 (11%) from North America, and 4 (9%) from Europe. Four studies reported data from multiple continents. Summary estimates suggested smear conversion in 9% of patients at 2 weeks (95% CI 3%-24%, 1 single study [N = 1]), and 82% of patients at 2 months of treatment (95% CI 78%-86%, N = 10). Among baseline smear-positive patients, solid culture conversion occurred by 2 weeks in 5% (95% CI 0%-14%, N = 2), increasing to 88% at 2 months (95% CI 84%-92%, N = 20). At equivalent time points, liquid culture conversion was achieved in 3% (95% CI 1%-16%, N = 1) and 59% (95% CI 47%-70%, N = 8). Significant heterogeneity was observed. Further interrogation of the data to explain this heterogeneity was limited by the lack of disaggregation of results, including by factors such as HIV status, baseline smear status, and the presence or absence of lung cavitation. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found that most patients remained culture positive at 2 weeks of TB treatment, challenging the view that individuals are not infectious after this interval. Culture positivity is, however, only 1 component of infectiousness, with reduced cough frequency and aerosol generation after TB treatment initiation likely to also be important. Studies that integrate our findings with data on cough dynamics could provide a more complete perspective on potential transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by individuals on treatment.

Information on the prevalence of M. pneumoniae in pediatric patients with CAP in Mexico is limited. The aim of this study was to detect M. pneumoniae in hospitalized pediatric patients with CAP. Patients and methods: We performed a descriptive study in a tertiary-level pediatric reference center, obtaining 154 respiratory samples from patients under 18 years of age and diagnosed with CAP. M. pneumoniae was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the p1 and CARDS genes. Complete blood cell count, measurement of C-reactive protein and detection of IgM and IgG anti-P1 were performed. Clinical, epidemiological and radiological data of the patients were analyzed. Results: M. pneumoniae was detected by real-time PCR in 26.6% of the samples. 39% of the cases occurred during the spring season. A total of 83% of the patients with M. pneumoniae had some underlying disease; renal disease, autoimmune disease and primary immunodeficiencies had a significant association with M. pneumoniae CAP. Children under 6 years of age represented 53.7% of the cases. Fever and cough were the most frequent symptoms. IgM and IgG were positive in 1.9% and 14% of the patients, respectively. In the chest X-ray, 17.1% of the patients showed multifocal alveolar infiltrates pattern. The complications in this series were 26.8%. The mortality in this study was 4.9%. Conclusion: This is the first report in Mexico about M. pneumoniae as a causal agent of CAP in a tertiary care pediatric hospital using real-time PCR and serology. M. pneumoniae was responsible for 26.6% of the cases and was frequent in children under 6 years of age.

However, HPV infection is unlikely to be sufficient to cause cervical cancer, and the contribution of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) could be the determining factor for cervical lesion-progression. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of STIs associated with HPV-positivity in 201 cervical samples from patients who underwent annual routine gynecological exams. The overall prevalence of STIs was 57.7%, and the most frequent infection was Ureaplasma spp (UP) (39.8%), followed by Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) (25.9%), alpha-HPV (18.4%), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) (1.5%), and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) (0.5%). The highest prevalence rate of multiple non-HPV infections was observed for the age-range 31-40; for papillomavirus infection, the age-range was 21-30. In normal cervical samples, HPV16 was the most prevalent genotype (24.3%), followed by genotypes 58 (13.5%) and 52 (10.8%). Intriguingly, HPV18 was not detected in the study population, and genotypes 52 and 58 were found exclusively in samples with abnormal cytology.

In the other case, IE of a prosthetic pulmonary valve was caused by Rothia dentocariosa. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for visualization of microorganisms within heart valve tissues in combination with PCR and sequencing (FISHseq). RESULTS: The two heart valve specimens featured mature biofilms of bacteria that were identified by FISHseq as Rothia aeria and Rothia dentocariosa, respectively. FISH showed in situ biofilms of both microorganisms that feature distinct phenotypes for the first time ex vivo. Both of our reported cases were treated successfully by heart valve surgery and antibiotic therapy using beta-lactam antibiotics.

Imbalance in oral and gut microbiome composition and associated gene expression has been linked to different forms of hematological (blood) cancers. Our objective is to compare oral microbiome profiles of patients with blood cancers (BC group: N = 39 patients, n = 124 oral samples) to those of healthy control subjects (HC group: N = 27 subjects, n = 100 oral samples). Saliva samples and swabs of buccal mucosa, supragingival plaque, and tongue were collected from blood cancer patients and healthy controls. Next-generation sequencing (16S-rRNA gene V3-V4 region) was used to determine the relative abundance of bacterial taxa present at the genus and species levels. Differences in oral microbiome beta-diversity were determined using multivariate permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis was performed to identify differentiating bacterial taxa in pairwise comparisons. The PATRICv3.6.7 online tool was used to determine the predominance of potential pathogenicity in the BC group. The oral microbiome beta-diversities of the BC and HC groups differed and corresponded to a reduced alpha-diversity in the BC group. LEfSe analysis showed significant LDA scores for Actinomyces and Rothia spp., differentiating the BC group from the HC group. In silico analysis using PATRICv3.6.7 demonstrated that the groups of bacteria possessing traits of ""antibiotic resistance"", ""oral pathogen"", and ""virulence"" was enriched in the BC group. Although 56% of the BC patients received antibiotics within two weeks of the oral bacterial sampling, Actinomyces genus remained the top differentiating feature in the BC group regardless of the administration of antibiotics, while Rothia dentocariosa was detected as the top differentiating feature in the BC patients who did not receive antibiotics, but not in those who received antibiotics.

Methods: Fifty-three African-American participants between the ages of 5-25, diagnosed with C/MIP were included. Patients underwent full mouth mechanical debridement with systemic antibiotics (metronidazole 250 mg + amoxicillin 500 mg, tid, 7 days). Subgingival samples were collected from a diseased and a healthy site from each individual prior to treatment and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after therapy from the same sites. Samples were subjected to a 16S rRNA gene based-microarray. Results: Treatment was effective in reducing the main clinical parameters of disease. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) was the strongest species associated with diseased sites.

Under a phase-contrast microscope, these bundles are visible as single polar flagella. Spheroplasts are formed in the stationary growth phase. Both strains are obligate organotrophs able to oxidize a number of reduced sulfur compounds. The oxidation of sulfide and polysulfide leads to the formation of intracellular globules of elemental sulfur; thiosulfate oxidation results in tetrathionate accumulation in the medium.

Tests for the first objective used Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia; those for the second used D. magna, Spirillum volutans, and Scenedesmus spinosus. Chemical analyses demonstrated that the removal of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, styrene, and naphthalene) from the petrochemical effluents ranged between 77 and 93%, but toxicity removal was significantly lower: untreated effluents were very toxic and treated effluents were very toxic to toxic [acute toxicity units (TUa) > 3]. Physicochemical parameters measured according to current Argentinian regulations indicated that industrial effluents (e.g., from textile and paper industries) were within established guidelines, but 25% of the samples were moderately to highly toxic (TUa > 1.33).

Typical organomercurial products included ethylmercury, phenylmercury, methoxyethylmercury and ethoxyethylmercury compounds. Risk assessment of these sites must be carried out before any major clean-up processes can be planned. A sensitive speciation technique for the various organomercury species in environmental matrices is a prerequisite for toxicity investigations. In this connection, a high-performance liquid chromatography-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HPLC-AFS) technique has been developed to differentiate between and determine the presence of eight organomercury compounds in environmental samples. Using this technique, methylmercury, ethylmercury and phenylmercury and some unknown organomercury species were found in soil samples collected from the sites of an old mercury products producing plant. With regard to risk assessment, it is necessary to assess the toxicity of the organomercurials. As different microbial metabolic pathways react differently to mercury and its compounds, batteries of bioassays are, therefore, useful to evaluate the toxicity of pollutants. To describe the toxicity and genotoxicity of MeHg+, MeOEtHg+, EtHg+, EtOEtHg+ and PhHg+, p-tolymercury chloride, nitromersol and Hg2+ six bioassays were used: resazurin reduction method, Spirillum volutans test, nematode toxicity assay Panagrellus redivivus, Toxi-Chromotest and SOS-Chromotest.

A complete set of geometrical parameters for each of these six cells, which are of typical but varying dimensions, was measured experimentally. For each cell, the mean swimming linear and angular speeds were measured for a period representing an exact number of flagellar cycles (at least four and up to 12 cycles). Two independent sets of measurements were carried out for each cell, one relating to the trailing and the other to the leading configuration of the flagellar bundle. The geometry of these cells was numerically modelled with curved isoparametric boundary elements (from the measured geometrical parameters), and an existing boundary element method (BEM) program was applied to predict the mean swimming linear and angular speeds. A direct comparison between the experimentally observed swimming speeds and those of the BEM predictions is made. For a typical cell, a direct comparison of the swimming trajectory, in each of the trailing and the leading flagellar configurations, was also included. Previous resistive force theory (RFT) as well as slender body theory (SBT) models are both restricted to somewhat non-realistic 'slender body' geometries, and they both fail to consider swimming kinematics. The present BEM model, however, is applicable to organisms with arbitrary geometry and correctly accounts for swimming kinematics; hence, it agrees better with experimental observations than do the previous models.",1477-9145 (Electronic) 0022-0949 (Linking),1994 Feb,,,['eng'],England,,,,

METHODS: Two MRSA strains, vancomycin-intermediate resistant ATCC 700699 and vancomycin-susceptible 2061 (both susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin), and their linezolid-resistant mutants selected by passaging on antibiotic-containing medium were used in the study. MPCs of antibiotics in combination were determined at a linezolid-to-daptomycin concentration ratio (1:2) that corresponds to the ratio of 24 h AUCs (AUC24s) actually used in the pharmacokinetic simulations. Each S. aureus strain was supplemented with respective linezolid-resistant mutants (mutation frequency 10-8) and treated with twice-daily linezolid and once-daily daptomycin, alone and in combination, simulated at therapeutic and sub-therapeutic AUC24s. RESULTS: Numbers of linezolid-resistant mutants increased at therapeutic and sub-therapeutic AUC24s, whereas daptomycin-resistant mutants were enriched only at sub-therapeutic AUC24 in single drug treatments. Linezolid/daptomycin combinations prevented the enrichment of linezolid-resistant S. aureus and restricted the enrichment of daptomycin-resistant mutants. The pronounced anti-mutant effects of the combinations were attributed to lengthening the time above MPC of both linezolid and daptomycin as their MPCs were lowered. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that (i) the inhibition of S. aureus resistant mutants using linezolid/daptomycin combinations can be predicted by MPCs determined at pharmacokinetically derived antibiotic concentration ratios and (ii) T>MPC is a reliable predictor of the anti-mutant efficacy of antibiotic combinations as studied using in vitro dynamic models.",1460-2091 (Electronic) 0305-7453 (Linking),2021 Apr 28,,"['6256239 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkab095 [doi]']",['eng'],England,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Epidemiological data show that, despite the availability of the free-of-cost 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for infants as part of the National Immunization Program, the burden of pneumococcal disease in young children remains high in the Philippines. The significant variability in data reported between studies highlights an urgent need for active and comprehensive disease surveillance for more accurate estimates of pneumococcal disease in the country. Although data from 2001 to 2013 show high rates of pneumococcal carriage in children in the Philippines aged < 5 years, contemporary data are lacking, again emphasizing the need for active surveillance programs. The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines has resulted in substantial declines in disease caused by pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccines, but the emergence of pneumococcal disease due to nonvaccine serotypes is an ongoing concern. Surveillance of actively circulating serotypes is critical to better understand vaccine coverage. Antimicrobial resistance of S. pneumoniae remains a significant threat to public health worldwide; data regarding antibiotic resistance in young children in the Philippines are limited, but reports generally show low rates of antibiotic resistance in this group. National immunization rates have increased in recent years, yet many individuals are still unprotected from pneumococcal disease. Overall, there is a critical need for contemporary and accurate disease surveillance in the Philippines.

Previous studies have shown that MXSGT has various pharmacological activities, including anti-influenza virus activity, and ameliorates microvascular hyperpermeability and inflammatory reactions. However, no study has reported the effect of MXSGT in the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, the potential inhibition of MXSGT against the virulence of S. pneumoniae by targeting PLY was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, HPLC analysis was used to determine the main components of MXSGT. Then PLY protein was constructed and used for hemolysis assay and western blot to test the ability of MXSGT to inhibit PLY activity, production and widowed characteristics. The growth curve of S. pneumoniae was drawled with or without MXSGT treatment. In addition, the inhibition of MXSGT against PLY-mediated A549 cell death was examined by cytotoxicity assay. Finally, the mouse experiment was used to verify the effect of MXSGT on mouse lungs. RESULTS: This work has discovered that MXSGT, a TCM prescription, is an effective inhibitor of PLY, an important virulence factor that is essential for S. pneumoniae pathogenicity. MXSGT inhibits the oligomerization of PLY without affecting S. pneumoniae growth and PLY production.

Among patients hospitalized for influenza pneumonia, we report the rate of coinfection and distribution of pathogens, and we compare outcomes of patients with and without bacterial coinfection. METHODS: We included adults admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and tested for influenza from 2010 to 2015 at 179 US hospitals participating in the Premier database. Pneumonia was identified using an International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) algorithm. We used multiple logistic and gamma-generalized linear mixed models to assess the relationships between coinfection and inpatient mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of stay, and cost. RESULTS: Among 38,665 patients hospitalized with CAP and tested for influenza, 4,313 (11.2%) were positive. In the first 3 hospital days, patients with influenza were less likely than those without to have a positive culture (10.3% vs 16.2%; P < .001), and cultures were more likely to contain Staphylococcus aureus (34.2% vs 28.2%; P = .007) and less likely to contain Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.9% vs 31.0%; P = .008). Of S. aureus isolates, 42.8% were methicillin resistant among influenza patients versus 53.2% among those without influenza (P = .01). After hospital day 3, pathogens for both groups were similar. Bacterial coinfection was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality (aOR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.17-4.16), late ICU transfer (aOR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.98-4.04), and higher cost (risk-adjusted mean multiplier, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.59-1.96). CONCLUSIONS: In a large US inpatient sample hospitalized with influenza and CAP, S. aureus was the most frequent cause of bacterial coinfection. Coinfection was associated with worse outcomes and higher costs.",1559-6834 (Electronic) 0899-823X (Linking),2021 Apr 23,,"['S0899823X21000969 [pii]', '10.1017/ice.2021.96 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,,,

Though conjugate vaccines have brought about a significant reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by vaccine serotypes, the relative serotype prevalence has shifted with dramatic emergence of serotype 24F in some countries. Herein, we describe fourteen isolates (thirteen IPD and one non-IPD) expressing a new capsule type, 24C, which resembles 24F but has a novel serological profile. We also describe the antigenic, biochemical, and genetic bases of 24F and 24C and the related serotypes 24A and 24B. Structural studies show that 24B, 24C, and 24F have identical polysaccharide backbones [beta-Ribf-(1-->4)-alpha-Rhap-(1-->3)-beta-GlcpNAc-(1-->4)-beta-Rhap-(1-->4)-beta -Glcp] but with different side chains: 24F has arabinitol-phosphate, and 24B has ribitol-phosphate. 24C has a mixture of 24F and 24B repeating units, with ratio of ribitol to arabinitol being strain-dependent. In contrast, 24A capsule has a backbone without beta-Ribf but with arabinitol-phosphate and phosphocholine side chains. These structures indicate that factor-sera 24d and 24e respectively recognize arabinitol and ribitol, which explains the serology of serogroup 24, including those of 24C. The structures can be genetically described by the bi-specificity of wcxG, capable of transferring arabinitol or ribitol when arabinitol is limiting. Arabinitol is likely not produced in 24B but is produced in reduced amounts in 24C due to various mutations in abpA or abpB genes. Our findings demonstrate how pneumococci modulate their capsule structure and immunologic properties with small genetic changes, thereby evading host immune responses. Our findings also suggest a potential for new capsule types within serogroup 24.",1098-660X (Electronic) 0095-1137 (Linking),2021 Apr 21,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7996-3875', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3625-1250', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2699-9057', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6922-1042']","['JCM.00540-21 [pii]', '10.1128/JCM.00540-21 [doi]']",['eng'],United States,,['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society for Microbiology.'],,

The aim of this study is, therefore, to assess the antimicrobial resistance profiles and multidrug resistance patterns of S. pneumoniae isolates from patients suspected of pneumococcal infections in Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based prospective study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2019 at Addis Ababa city and Amhara National Region State Referral Hospitals. Antimicrobial resistance tests were performed from isolates of S. pneumoniae that were collected from pediatric and adult patients. Samples (cerebrospinal fluid, blood, sputum, eye discharge, ear discharge, and pleural and peritoneal fluids) from all collection sites were initially cultured on 5% sheep blood agar plates and incubated overnight at 37 degrees C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified and confirmed by typical colony morphology, alpha-hemolysis, Gram staining, optochin susceptibility, and bile solubility test. Drug resistance testing was performed using the E-test method according to recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: Of the 57 isolates, 17.5% were fully resistant to penicillin. The corresponding value for both cefotaxime and ceftriaxone was 1.8%. Resistance rates to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were 59.6%, 17.5%, 38.6%, 17.5 and 24.6%, respectively. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was seen in 33.3% isolates. The most common pattern was co-resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline. CONCLUSIONS: Most S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Penicillin has been used as a drug of choice for treating S. pneumoniae infection. However, antimicrobial resistance including multidrug resistance was observed to several commonly used antibiotics including penicillin. Hence, it is important to periodically monitor the antimicrobial resistance patterns to select empirical treatments for better management of pneumococcal infection.",1476-0711 (Electronic) 1476-0711 (Linking),2021 Apr 20,,"['10.1186/s12941-021-00432-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12941-021-00432-z [pii]']",['eng'],England,"['Antimicrobial resistance', 'Multidrug resistance', 'Streptococcus pneumoniae']",,,

Under a state of dysbiosis, both bacteria cause intrauterine infection. Material and methods: Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to analyze the prevalence of UU and MH among four hundred and eleven infertile women. Results: Women between thirty and thirty-five years old were the most affected group, followed by those that were 25 and 30 years old, respectively. Cumulatively, the prevalence of single UU and MH, and coinfection, was 28.46% (n = 117), (n = 2) 0.48%, and 2.91% (n = 12), respectively, with an overall detection rate of 31.87% (n = 131). To assess the associated drug susceptibility, endocervical samples were unequally sent to Regina Maria (n = 281) and Synevo (n = 130) laboratories for further analyses. Pristinamycin (100% vs. 100%) and Josamycin (100% vs. 98.00%) were the most efficient antibiotics in eradicating UU and MH, several others also displaying a high efficiency, among which can be mentioned Doxycycline (98.23%), Minocycline (96.00%), Tetracycline (96.48% vs. 68.00%), and Erythromycin (70.17% vs. 92.00%). Based on antibiograms, Clarithromycin (88.00%), Roxithromycin (88.00%), Levofloxacin (82.00%), and Azithromycin (78.94%) can be further used in treating such infections. On the other hand, Clindamycin (4.00%) and Ciprofloxacin (12.27% vs. 2.00%) are no longer viable because both UU and MH display an intermediate response towards gained resistance. Interestingly, the efficiency of Ofloxacin (22.79% vs. 60.00%) was conflicting, this possibly suggesting a transient stage to a gradual adaptability of these microorganisms to Ofloxacin. Conclusions: The most susceptible age groups in each case were women that were between twenty and forty years old. It can be concluded that four antibiotics can be safely used for treating UU, MH, or dual infections whose efficiency was over 95%.",1648-9144 (Electronic) 1010-660X (Linking),2021 Feb 26,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6618-141X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4023-1765', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8244-0522']","['medicina57030211 [pii]', '10.3390/medicina57030211 [doi]']",['eng'],Switzerland,"['Mycoplasma hominis', 'Ureaplasma urealyticum', 'drug susceptibility', 'infertility', 'prevalence']",,,

Intrauterine GV infection adversely affects pregnancy outcomes, resulting in preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and neonatal pneumonia. The knowledge of how GV exerts its effects is limited. We developed an in vivo animal model to study its effects on fetal development. Materials and Methods: A survival mini-laparotomy was conducted on New Zealand rabbits on gestational day 21 (28 weeks of human pregnancy). In each dam, fetuses in the right uterine horn received intra-amniotic 0.5 x 10(2) colony-forming units of GV injections each, while their littermate controls in the left horn received sterile saline injections. A second laparotomy was performed seven days later. Assessment of the fetal pups, histopathology of the placenta and histomorphometric examination of the fetal lung tissues was done. Results: Three dams with a combined total of 12 fetuses were exposed to intra-amniotic GV, and 9 fetuses were unexposed. The weights of fetuses, placenta, and fetal lung were significantly lower in the GV group than the saline-inoculated control group [mean gross weight, GV (19.8 +/- 3.8 g) vs. control (27.9 +/- 1.7 g), p < 0.001; mean placenta weight, GV (5.5 +/- 1.0 g) vs. control (6.5 +/- 0.7 g), p = 0.027; mean fetal lung weight, GV (0.59 +/- 0.11 g) vs. control (0.91 +/- 0.08 g), p = 0.002. There was a two-fold increase in the multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta of the GV group than their littermate controls (82.9 +/- 14.9 vs. 41.6 +/- 13.4, p < 0.001). The mean alveolar septae of GV fetuses was significantly thicker than the control (14.8 +/- 2.8 mum vs. 12.4 +/- 3.8 mum, p = 0.007). Correspondingly, the proliferative index in the interalveolar septum was 1.8-fold higher in the GV group than controls (24.9 +/- 6.6% vs. 14.2 +/- 2.9%, p = 0.011). The number of alveoli and alveolar surface area did not vary between groups. Discussion: Low-dose intra-amniotic GV injection induces fetal growth restriction, increased placental multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts and fetal lung re-modeling characterized by alveolar septal hypertrophy with cellular proliferative changes. Conclusion: This intra-amniotic model could be utilized in future studies to elucidate the acute and chronic effects of GV intrauterine infections.",2296-2360 (Print) 2296-2360 (Linking),2020,,['10.3389/fped.2020.593802 [doi]'],['eng'],Switzerland,"['bacterial vaginosis', 'bronchopulmonary dysplasia', 'fetal lung development', 'intra-amniotic', 'intrauterine growth restriction', 'intrauterine infection', 'multinucleated syncytiotrophoblasts', 'rabbit model']","['Copyright (c) 2021 Cheah, Lai, Tan, Swaminathan, Wong, Wong and Tan.']",,
