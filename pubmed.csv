33685690,"In vitro antimicrobial resistance profiles of Streptococcus uberis, Lactococcus spp., and Enterococcus spp. from quarter milk samples of cows between 2015 and 2019 in Southern Germany.",Journal of dairy science,"The objective was to describe and compare antimicrobial resistance patters of esculin-hydrolyzing streptococci and streptococcal-like organisms (Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus lactis) from routine diagnostic samples of the udder health laboratory of the Bavarian Animal Health Services between 2015 and 2019. All routine diagnostic samples of the udder health laboratory of the Bavarian Animal Health Services, that were tested with a standard microbroth dilution, were eligible to be included in this retrospective case series. A California Mastitis Test result was available for all samples. Most Strep. uberis and L. lactis were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Enterococcus faecium had consistently the highest minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of tested isolates. The resistance patterns of Lactococcus garvieae were positioned between enterococci and L. lactis. The minimum inhibitory concentration for various antibiotics and pathogens tended to decrease over the 5-yr period. Regardless of the pathogen, isolates of clinical cases were less likely to express in vitro resistance than isolates of healthy or subclinical cases. Streptococcus uberis or L. lactis showed hardly any in vitro resistance to tested antibiotic groups. Penicillin should remain the first-choice antimicrobial for the therapy of Strep. uberis and Lactococcus spp. However, a success of any antimicrobial treatment of enterococcal infections seems questionable.",10.3168/jds.2020-19896,"[{'lastname': 'Sorge', 'firstname': 'Ulrike S', 'initials': 'US', 'affiliation': 'Department of Udder Health and Milk Quality, Bavarian Animal Health Services, 85586 Poing, Germany.

33663929,First characterization of Tn1546-like structures of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium Thai isolates.,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,"Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) carrying vanA was first isolated from patient at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand in 2004. Since then, VREfm isolates have been detected increasingly in this 2500-bed university hospital. To understand the epidemiology of vanA VREfm in this setting, the isolates collected during 2004-2013 were characterized.
A total of 49 vanA VREfm isolates previously confirmed by multiplex PCR were characterized by determining resistance phenotypes to vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin and ciprofloxacin by broth microdilution method. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and virulence genes of those isolates were investigated. The Tn1546 structure diversity was studied by long-range overlapping PCR and primer walking sequencing.
Of all isolates studied, 9 sequence types (ST17, ST80, ST78, ST730, ST203, ST18, ST280, ST64, ST323) in clonal complex 17 and a novel ST1051 were revealed. The esp-positive isolates were 73.5%. Of all vanA operons characterized, at least 9 types of Tn1546-like structures were detected. All of vanA determinants contained 5'-end different from the Tn1546 prototype. Approximately 47% of them also carried the insertion sequence IS1251 at the intergenic region between vanS and vanH. Interestingly, another IS (ISEfa4) was found to be inside the sequence of IS1251 in ST17 isolate.
Heterogeneity of vanA VREfm was observed. Nearly all of isolates studied belonged to CC17. One novel ST1051 strain was detected. Isolates in the initial period carried vanA operon similar to the prototype. The diversity of vanA determinants has been increased in the recent isolates. A novel vanA operon structure was detected.",10.1016/j.jiac.2021.02.013,"[{'lastname': 'Wongnak', 'firstname': 'Kornikar', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Pattanachaiwit', 'firstname': 'Supanit', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Rattanasirirat', 'firstname': 'Wasinee', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Limsrivanichakorn', 'firstname': 'Sunee', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiratisin', 'firstname': 'Pattarachai', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Assanasen', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Leelaporn', 'firstname': 'Amornrut', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.

The effect of water activity on thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella and Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 in ground black pepper has not been studied previously. Identification of a suitable surrogate assists in conducting in-plant process validations. Ground black pepper was inoculated with a 5-serotype Salmonella cocktail or E. faecium NRRL B-2354, equilibrated to water activities of 0.25, 0.45 or 0.65 in a humidity-controlled chamber, and isothermally treated at different temperatures. The survivor data were used for fitting the log-linear models to obtain the D and z-values of Salmonella and E. faecium in ground black pepper. Modified Bigelow models were developed to evaluate the effects of temperature and water activity on the thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella and E. faecium. Water activity and temperature showed significant negative effects on the thermal resistance of Salmonella and E. faecium in ground black pepper.

The spread of antibiotic resistance has posed a serious challenge to treating the enterococcal infections. High-level aminoglycosides resistance leads to failure in the synergistic combination therapy. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) among clinical isolates of enterococci in Iran.Systematic literature search was conducted in the Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar electronic databases from ar-ticles which were published from April 2000 to September 2018. Literature search yielded 918 studies. Eligible studies were selected ac-cording to the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Statistical heterogeneity was estimated by Q statistic and the I2 index. The Begg's rank correlation test and Egger's weighted regression tests were used to evaluate possible publication bias.Nineteen studies were included in this review. According to the meta-analysis results, the prevalence of HLGR among Enterococcus spp. was 49.4% (95% CI: 42.2%-56.6%). It was estimated 44.3% (95% CI: 38.1%-50.8%) and 66.3% (95% CI: 51.4%-78.6%) for E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively.Since notable rate of HLGR in enterococci was seen in this analysis, improving the implementation of all aspects of the infection control programmes is required.

33645738,A proposed scheme for the monitoring of antibiotic resistance in veterinary pathogens of food animals in the UK.,The Veterinary record,"Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a global threat to both animal and public health, and detecting its occurrence is an important component of control strategies. Monitoring programmes for antibiotic resistance are currently in place in food-producing animals in the European Union covering the zoonotic bacteria Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni and the indicator bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. However, there is no equivalent pan-European statutory monitoring programme covering the antibiotic susceptibility of veterinary bacterial pathogens in food animals. This paper considers that issue and aims to facilitate and stimulate further discussion.
Recommendations, proposed by the authors from the scientific literature and following expert discussion at international meetings, are presented for monitoring the susceptibility of key veterinary pathogens.
The selected veterinary pathogens comprise Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, E. coli, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. from the major food animal species cattle, pigs and poultry. The organisms are tested using harmonised panels of antibiotics over specified dilution ranges in a broth microdilution method.
The selected antibiotics and their respective dilution ranges are presented together with the underlying rationale for inclusion; the ranges chosen are suitable for incorporation into three microtitre plates, with each organism tested using a single plate. The recommendations are being implemented in 2020 in the UK for monitoring of the susceptibility of veterinary bacterial pathogens.",10.1002/vetr.201,"[{'lastname': 'Teale', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Animal and Plant Health Agency Shrewsbury, Shropshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Borriello', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Veterinary Medicines Directorate, Addlestone, Surrey, UK.'}]"

33638975,Sites and Causes of Infection in Patients with Sepsis-Associated Liver Dysfunction: A Population Study from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III.,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,"BACKGROUND Little is known about the relationship between the site of infection, type of pathogen, and the occurrence of sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD). This population study aimed to identify the sites and types of infection in SALD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective observational study using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III. Patients with sepsis were divided into a SALD group and a control group. We evaluated the effect of the location of culture-positive specimens and the distribution of pathogens on the occurrence of SALD and then compared the clinical outcomes. RESULTS A total of 14 596 admissions were included, and the incidence of SALD was 11.96%. Positive bile culture (odds ratio [OR] 7.450, P<0.001), peritoneal fluid culture (OR 3.616, P<0.001), and blood culture (OR 1.957, P<0.001) were correlated with the occurrence of SALD. Infection with Enterococcus faecium (OR 3.065, P<0.001), Bacteroides fragilis (OR 2.061, P<0.001), Klebsiella oxytoca (OR 2.066, P<0.001), Enterobacter aerogenes (OR 1.92, P=0.001), and Aspergillus fumigatus (OR 2.144, P=0.001) were correlated with the occurrence of SALD.

The activity of NCT against these clinical isolates is similar to that against non-resistant ATCC strains and therefore not influenced by antibiotic resistance. This can be explained by the oxidizing and chlorinating mechanism of action of NCT, which leads to an attack of multiple targets in the microorganisms.

There is a paucity of data on VRE in many countries of Asia as well as limited pooled estimates. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate a pooled prevalence of VRE in Asia.
A literature search in electronic databases like PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar and manual searching of references and grey literature, comprising the information on the prevalence of VRE with at least two species of enterococci, conducted in different countries of Asia from January 1, 2000, to September 20, 2020, was done. The random-effect model and 95% CIs was used to calculate the pooled prevalence. Subgroup, sensitivity and meta-regression analyses were performed to address heterogeneity while Egger's test for publication bias.
We identified 39 studies, comprising a total of 11,875 enterococcal isolates. The result of the analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of VRE in Asia was 8.10% (95% CI; 7-9; I

33618041,Using core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates to guide infection control interventions and end an outbreak.,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,"Until July 2016, vancomycin-resistantEnterococcus faecium (VREfm) was sporadically detected in Odense University Hospital, Denmark. After July 2016, the number of VREfm cases increased. This study aimed to apply a core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme for E. faecium to type and analyse VREfm isolates collected at a single Danish hospital and to compare the results with cgMLST data from other regions of Denmark to trace transmission.
A total of 38 VREfm clinical isolates from inpatients at the hospital in the period January 2014 through June 2017 were included in the study and analysed using whole-genome sequencing. Use of SeqSphere + software was initiated from the beginning of June 2017 to obtain MLST, cgMLST and epi curves. Admission histories were incorporated and national surveillance data on cgMLST were used to identify transmission routes.
Six different sequence types (STs) were identified, the most frequent being ST80, ST117 and ST203. cgMLST subdivided the 38 isolates into 18 different complex types (CTs) with 13 isolates (34%) belonging to ST80-CT993. Epi curves indicated transmission of ST80-CT993 in several departments. Transmission from patients transferred from other hospitals was not identifiable. Infection control interventions launched in one department ended the outbreak.
The high resolution of cgMLST allowed for detailed interpretation with evidence of nosocomial transmission of specific CTs. cgMLST made it easy to compare our local isolates with national findings, thereby clarifying transmission routes. Supplemented with admission histories, cgMLST targeted the epidemiological investigation and delineated the expensive and time-consuming infection control interventions.",10.1016/j.jgar.2021.02.007,"[{'lastname': 'Kjær Hansen', 'firstname': 'Sanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Research Unit for Department of Clinical Microbiology, Odense University Hospital, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark; Department of Bacteria, Parasites and Fungi, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen S, Denmark.

Limited data are available on SSI epidemiology following liver transplant procedures (LTPs). We analyzed data on SSIs from 2015-2018 reported to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network to determine rates, pathogen distribution, and antimicrobial resistance after LTPs and other hepatic, biliary, or pancreatic procedures (BILIs). LTP and BILI SSI rates were 5.7% and 5.9%, respectively. The odds of SSI after LTP were lower than after BILI (adjusted odds ratio = 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.85). Among LTP SSIs, 43.1% were caused by Enterococcus spp., 17.2% by Candida spp., and 15.0% by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CNS). Percentages of SSIs caused by Enterococcus faecium or CNS were higher after LTPs than BILIs, whereas percentages of SSIs caused by Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus faecalis, or viridans streptococci were higher after BILIs. Antimicrobial resistance was common in LTP SSI pathogens, including E. faecium (69.4% vancomycin-resistant); E. coli (68.8% fluoroquinolone-non-susceptible, 44.7% extended spectrum cephalosporin [ESC]-non-susceptible); and K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca (39.4% fluoroquinolone-non-susceptible, 54.5% ESC-non-susceptible).

33608525,Cas12a-assisted precise targeted cloning using in vivo Cre-lox recombination.,Nature communications,"Direct cloning represents the most efficient strategy to access the vast number of uncharacterized natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. However, due to their large size, repetitive nature, or high GC-content, large-scale cloning of these BGCs remains an overwhelming challenge. Here, we report a scalable direct cloning method named Cas12a-assisted precise targeted cloning using in vivo Cre-lox recombination (CAPTURE) which consists of Cas12a digestion, a DNA assembly approach termed T4 polymerase exo + fill-in DNA assembly, and Cre-lox in vivo DNA circularization. We apply this method to clone 47 BGCs ranging from 10 to 113 kb from both Actinomycetes and Bacilli with ~100% efficiency. Heterologous expression of cloned BGCs leads to the discovery of 15 previously uncharacterized natural products including six cyclic head-to-tail heterodimers with a unique 5/6/6/6/5 pentacyclic carbon skeleton, designated as bipentaromycins A-F. Four of the bipentaromycins show strong antimicrobial activity to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycinresistant Enterococcus faecium, and bioweapon Bacillus anthracis. Due to its robustness and efficiency, our direct cloning method coupled with heterologous expression provides an effective strategy for large-scale discovery of novel natural products.",10.1038/s41467-021-21275-4,"[{'lastname': 'Enghiad', 'firstname': 'Behnam', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Carl R.

33604693,Repositioning of antidepressant drugs and synergistic effect with ciprofloxacin against multidrug-resistant bacteria.,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,"The repositioning of drugs has been shown to be an advantageous alternative for treating diseases caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganisms. The study aimed to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of the antidepressants fluoxetine and paroxetine alone and in combination with the antibacterial ciprofloxacin against standard strains and clinical isolates to explore the repositioning of these drugs in severe bacterial infections. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), tolerance level, fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) and interaction of antidepressants with the ciprofloxacin antibiotic were determined using the Checkerboard method against six American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) standard strains and seventy MDR clinical isolates. Both antidepressants showed better antibacterial activity than ciprofloxacin, in addition to being separately bactericidal against all tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive strains. When associated with ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine and paroxetine exhibited significant synergism compared to seventy ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates, demonstrating that these antidepressants were able to increase the antibacterial activity of the antibiotic by eight times. The combination of antidepressants with ciprofloxacin showed relatively better activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecium and Klebsiella pneumoniae, strains in which the FICI value obtained was 0.008. The MDR isolates tested in this study ratify the antibacterial properties of the non-antibiotic fluoxetine and paroxetine. In addition, synergism when associated with ciprofloxacin is an alternative for treating serious infections in hospitalized patients. However, additional in vivo studies must be conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of action of these drugs.","10.1007/s11274-021-03016-3

33602300,"Management of a hospital-wide vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium outbreak in a Dutch general hospital, 2014-2017: successful control using a restrictive screening strategy.",Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,"The emergence of vancomycin resistant enterococci poses a major problem in healthcare settings. Here we describe a hospital-wide outbreak of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in a general hospital in The Netherlands in the period December 2014-February 2017. Due to late detection of the outbreak, a large cohort of approximately 25,000 (discharged) patients was classified as 'VRE suspected'. Hereupon a mitigated screening and isolation policy, as compared with the national guideline, was implemented to control the outbreak.
After the outbreak was identified, a screening policy consisting of a single rectal swab culture (with enrichment broth) to discontinue isolation and removing 'VRE suspected' label in the electronic patient files for readmitted VRE suspected patients, was implemented. In addition to the on admission screening, periodic hospital-wide point prevalence screening, measures to improve compliance with standard infection control precautions and enhanced environmental cleaning were implemented to control the outbreak.
Between September 2014 and February 2017, 140 patients were identified to be colonised by vanA mediated vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm). Two of these patients developed bacteraemia. AFLP typing showed that the outbreak was caused by a single clone. Extensive environmental contamination was found in multiple wards. Within nine months after the detection of the outbreak no new VRE cases were detected.
We implemented a control strategy based on targeted screening and isolation in combination with implementation of general precautions and environmental cleaning. The strategy was less stringent than the Dutch national guideline for VRE control. This strategy successfully controlled the outbreak, while it was associated with a reduction in the number of isolation days and the number of cultures taken.",10.1186/s13756-021-00906-x,"[{'lastname': 'Weterings', 'firstname': 'Veronica', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infection Control, Amphia Hospital, P.O.

33594545,In vitro properties of potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria originating from Ghanaian indigenous fermented milk products.,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,"Fermented milk products are a major source of health-promoting microorganisms known as probiotics. To characterize the probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Ghanaian traditionally fermented milk, thirty (30) isolates comprising Enterococcus faecium (1), Lactobacillus fermentum (14), Lb. plantarum (2) and Pediococcus acidilactici (13) identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, were tested for survival at low pH (2.5) and bile salts (0.3% (w/v)), hydrophobicity, co-aggregation, auto-aggregation and antimicrobial activities against selected pathogens. Safety of potential probiotic bacteria was assessed by hemolytic activity on blood agar and susceptibility to nine different antibiotics. Majority (90%) of the strains showed survival rates above 80% at pH (2.5) and in bile salts (0.3% (w/v)). Hydrophobicity ranged from 5 to 61% while cell auto-aggregation ranged from 41 to 80% after 24 h. Co-aggregation with E. coli (3.7-43.9%) and S. Typhimurium (1.3-49.5%) were similar for the LAB strains at 24 h. Cell- free supernatants of all LAB strains inhibited E. coli while S. Typhimurium was not sensitive to cell-free supernatants of five Pd. acidilactici strains: OS24h20, OS18h3, OY9h19, OS9h8 and 24NL38. None of the LAB strains showed β-hemolysis but 38% of strains showed α-hemolysis. Susceptibilities to antibiotics were strain-specific; only four strains, two Lb. fermentum and two Pd. acidilactici were susceptible to all nine antibiotics tested. Based on high survival rates in bile salts, low pH and generally good hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, co-aggregation and inhibitory activities, 15 out of 30 strains tested were considered qualified candidates for development of probiotic cultures for fermented milk products in sub-Saharan Africa.","10.1007/s11274-021-03013-6

33590037,"Prospective study of surgical site infections post-open esophageal cancer surgery, and the impact of care bundles.",Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,"SSIs represent common infection-related morbidity following major surgery. Modern care bundles have been established as prophylactic measures aimed at preventing SSI occurring postoperatively. SSI incidence and data on common culprit pathogens post-esophagectomy for cancer have not been previously reported. Patients (2013-2018) treated with curative intent were studied. SSI was defined as per the Center for Disease Control (CDC) definition. A care bundle pathway following the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for prevention of SSIs was introduced in 2013 and was audited quarterly. Risk factors and associations of SSIs were analyzed, as was the prevalence of isolated pathogens. Multivariable logistic regression examined independently predictive factors of SSIs and oncologic outcomes. Of 343 patients, 34 (9.9%) developed a postoperative SSI, with a median (range) of 8 (6-17). Quarterly audit carried out over 6 years showed no significant annual variance or trend. The most prevalent pathogen cultured was Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in nine patients (32%) followed by Candida albicans (29%), Escherichia coli (14%), and Enterococcus faecium (11%). SSI was significantly associated with pneumonia (P = 0.001), respiratory failure (P = 0.014), atrial fibrillation (P = 0.004), anastomotic leak (P < 0.001), and in-hospital blood transfusions (P = 0.031). SSI did not impact the overall survival (P = 0.951). SSI rates can be maintained at less than 10% using strict care bundles and regular audit. The most common culprit pathogen is gram-positive MSSA representing 32% of cases. These data are novel and may represent a modern benchmark for SSI post-open esophagectomy for cancer.

Thus, finding therapeutic agents for the treatment of such infections are crucial. Some Enterococcus faecalis strains are able to produce antimicrobial peptides called bacteriocins. We analyzed 65 E. faecalis isolates from 43 food samples and 22 clinical samples in Egypt for 17 common bacteriocin-encoding genes of Enterococcus spp. These genes were absent in 11 isolates that showed antimicrobial activity putatively due to bacteriocins (three from food, including isolate OS13, and eight from clinical isolates). The food-isolated E. faecalis OS13 produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) named enterocin OS13, which comprised two peptides (enterocin OS13α OS13β) that inhibited the growth of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates. The molecular weights of enterocin OS13α and OS13β were determined as 8079 Da and 7859 Da, respectively, and both were heat-labile. Enterocin OS13α was sensitive to proteinase K, while enterocin OS13β was resistant. Characterization of E. faecalis OS13 isolate revealed that it belonged to sequence type 116. It was non-hemolytic, bile salt hydrolase-negative, gelatinase-positive, and sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin.

33582200,Successful containment of two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) outbreaks in a Dutch teaching hospital using environmental sampling and whole genome sequencing.,The Journal of hospital infection,"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) may cause nosocomial outbreaks. We describe all VRE carriers that were identified in 2018.
To investigate the genetic relatedness of the VRE isolates and the possibility of a common environmental reservoir using environmental sampling and whole genome sequencing (WGS).
Infection control measures consisted of contact isolation, contact surveys, point prevalence screening, environmental sampling, cleaning and disinfection. VRE isolates were sequenced on a MiSeq sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and assembled using SPAdes v.3.10.1. A minimal spanning tree and a neighbour joining tree based on allele diversity of cgMLST and accessory genes using Ridom SeqSphere+ software (Ridom GmbH, Münster, Germany) was created.
During a one year period, 19 VRE carriers were identified of whom 17 were part of two outbreaks. Before environmental cleaning and disinfection, 55 (14%) environmental samples were VRE positive. Fifty-one isolates (23 patient and 28 environmental samples) were available for WGS analysis. Forty-four isolates could be assigned to ST117-vanB, five to ST17-vanB, and two to ST80-vanB. Isolates from outbreak 1 (n=22) and outbreak 2 (n=22) both belonged to ST117-vanB, WGS, however, showed a different cluster type with 257 allelic differences.
The present study shows that WGS of two outbreak strains provided discrimination information regarding genetic relatedness and rejected the hypothesis of a common environmental reservoir. A high degree of environmental contamination was associated with more VRE transmission. Quantification of environmental contamination may reflects VRE transmission potential and could therefore support the infection control measures.",10.1016/j.jhin.2021.02.007,"[{'lastname': 'Gast', 'firstname': 'K B', 'initials': 'KB', 'affiliation': 'Microvida Laboratory of Medical Microbiology and Immunology and.

LAB strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and their antibacterial activity was assessed by the microdilution method. Four LAB isolates, Weissella confusa PL6, Enterococcus faecium PL7, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii PL11 and PL13 were shortlisted. Their ability to degrade lactose and safety for human consumption in terms of hemolysis and antibiotic susceptibility were assessed in vitro. The antibacterial components in the cell-free supernatants (CFSs) of isolate cultures were characterized biochemically by HPLC.
Acid neutralization but not protease treatment abolished the antibacterial activity of CFSs. Lactic, acetic and propionic acids were the main acids in the CFSs, and acid production peaked in the stationary phase of growth. The antibacterial activity of the LAB cultures resulted from secretion of organic acids that lowered the pH. The strains exhibited variable ability to degrade lactose and were non-hemolytic and susceptible to the most common antibiotics.
These LAB strains are probiotic candidates for further investigation of their postbiotic role in naturally preserving processed foods and for attenuation of lactose intolerance.",10.3855/jidc.13404,"[{'lastname': 'Hussain', 'firstname': 'Nazar', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'National Probiotics Lab-HBD, National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE), Faisalabad, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tariq', 'firstname': 'Muhammad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'National Probiotics Lab-HBD, National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE), Faisalabad, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Saris', 'firstname': 'Per Erik Joakim', 'initials': 'PEJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaidi', 'firstname': 'Arsalan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'National Probiotics Lab-HBD, National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE), Faisalabad, Pakistan. azlanzaidi@yahoo.com.'}]"

The aim of our study was to determine the microbiological, epidemiological and molecular characteristics of VREfm isolated in north-central, eastern and western Algeria.
a collection of 48 VREfm isolated from September 2010 to April 2017 in several Algerian hospitals were studied. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by E-test method according to CLSI guidelines. the detection of van genotype of all strains was performed by PCR. Clonal relationship of five VREfm targeted by region were characterized using multilocus sequence typing (MLST).
All isolates have multidrug-resistance (MDR) and were resistant to at least five classes of antibiotics; however, all were susceptible to tigecycline and daptomycin with MIC50 at 0.094 µg/mL and 2 µg/mL respectively. All strains belonged to vanA genotype and have high level of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. MLST revealed two sequence types (STs): ST80 (from the four regions of Algeria) and ST789, both belonging to the former hospital-adapted clonal complex CC17.

ESKAPE bacteria which includes Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae are considered the most important, because of their close relationship with the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The aim of this work was to identify and characterize ESKAPE bacteria and to detect their possible clonal spread in medical devices, patients, and medical personnel of the ICU for COVID-19 patients of the Hospital Juarez de Mexico.
Genetic identification of ESKAPE bacteria was performed by analyzing the 16S rRNA gene. Resistance assays were performed according to the CLSI guidelines. Assembly of AdeABCRS operon and inhibition assays of pumps efflux in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were performed. Associated gene involved in biofilm formation (icaA) was performed in isolates belonging to the Staphylococcus genus. Finally, typing by ERIC-PCR and characterization of mobile genetic element SCCmec were done.
Heterogeneous distribution of ESKAPE and non-ESKAPE bacteria was detected in various medical devices, patients, and medical personnel. Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant ESKAPE members. The analysis of intergenic regions revealed an important clonal distribution of A. baumannii (AdeABCRS+).

Essential components of those recommendations were antimicrobial teams in hospitals and the use of feedback to prescribers as well as educational activities. Two decades later, important surveillance systems on both antimicrobial resistance as well as on antibiotic consumption are functioning at the European level and in most European countries; European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) has thoroughly re-evaluated, standardized and harmonized antibiotic susceptibility testing and breakpoints; there have been educational activities in many countries; and stewardship teams are now included in many guidelines and policy papers and recommendations. Yet, antimicrobial resistance problems in Europe have shifted from methicillin-resistant Staphylococus aureus (MRSA) to vancomycin-resistent Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and to multidrug-resistant gramnegative bacteria, while antibiotic consumption volumes, trends and patterns across countries do not show major and highly significant improvements. The way to go further is to recognize that better prescribing comes at a cost and requires investment in expert personnel, practice guideline drafting, and implementation aids, and, secondly, the setting of clear goals and quantitative targets for prescribing quality.",10.1007/s10354-020-00796-5,"[{'lastname': 'Kern', 'firstname': 'Winfried V', 'initials': 'WV', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University Hospital and Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, Albert-Ludwigs-University, 79106, Freiburg, Germany. winfried.kern@uniklinik-freiburg.de.'}]"

In the process, gold ions in a gold chloride (HAuCl4) solution were reduced using trisodium citrate (Na3Ct), a reducing agent, and upon UV illumination, red-colored AuNPs were produced in the presence of LAMP amplicons. The nitrogenous bases of the target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) acted as a physical support for capturing gold ions dissolved in the sample. The high affinity of gold with the nitrogenous bases enabled facile detection within 10 min, and the detection limit of COVID-19 plasmid DNA was as low as 42 fg μL-1. To ensure POCT, we designed a portable device that contained arrays of reagent chambers and detection chambers. In the portable device, colorimetric reagents such as HAuCl4 and Na3Ct were contained in the reagent chambers; these reagents were subsequently transferred to the detection chambers where LAMP amplicons were present and thus allowed convenient sample delivery and multiplex detection. Owing to the high sensitivity of the in situ AuNPs, simplicity of portable device fabrication, and rapid colorimetric detection, we strongly believe that the fabricated portable device could serve as a kit for rapid POCT for instantaneous detection of infectious diseases, and could be readily usable at the bedside.",10.1039/d1lc00019e,"[{'lastname': 'Sivakumar', 'firstname': 'Rajamanickam', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Industrial Environmental Engineering, College of Industrial Environmental Engineering, Gachon University, 1342 Seongnam-daero, Sujeong-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do 13120, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Dinh', 'firstname': 'Vu Phong', 'initials': 'VP', 'affiliation': 'Department of BioNano Technology, Gachon University, 1342 Seongnam-daero, Sujeong-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do 13120, Korea. nylee@gachon.ac.kr.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Nae Yoon', 'initials': 'NY', 'affiliation': 'Department of BioNano Technology, Gachon University, 1342 Seongnam-daero, Sujeong-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do 13120, Korea. nylee@gachon.ac.kr.'}]"

33541292,Anticancer and antimicrobial potential of enterocin 12a from Enterococcus faecium.,BMC microbiology,"Increase in the number of infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria in neutropenic cancer patients has prompted the search for novel therapeutic agents having dual anticancer and antimicrobial properties. Bacteriocins are cationic proteins of prokaryotic origin that have emerged as one of the most promising alternative antimicrobial agents with applications as food preservatives and therapeutic agents. Apart from their antimicrobial activities, bacteriocins are also being explored for their anticancer potential.
In this study, a broad-spectrum, cell membrane-permeabilizing enterocin with a molecular weight of 65 kDa was purified and characterized from the culture supernatant of vaginal Enterococcus faecium 12a. Enterocin 12a inhibited multidrug-resistant strains of various Gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica, Shigella flexneri, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli and Gram-positive, Listeria monocytogenes, but had no activities against different strains of gut lactobacilli. The mass spectrometric analysis showed that the enterocin 12a shared partial homology with 4Fe-4S domain-containing redox protein of E. faecalis R712. Further, enterocin 12a selectively inhibited the proliferation of various human cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner but not that of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Enterocin 12a-treated cancer cells showed apoptosis-like morphological changes.
Enterocin 12a is a novel bacteriocin that has anticancer properties against human cell lines and negligible activity towards non-malignant cells. Therefore, it should be further evaluated for its anticancer potential in animal models.",10.1186/s12866-021-02086-5,"[{'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Preeti', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, 143005, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaur', 'firstname': 'Sumanpreet', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, 143005, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Chadha', 'firstname': 'Bhupinder Singh', 'initials': 'BS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, 143005, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaur', 'firstname': 'Raminderjit', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaur', 'firstname': 'Manpreet', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Genetics, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaur', 'firstname': 'Sukhraj', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjab, 143005, India. drsukhrajkaur@gmail.com.'}]"

33536484,Bacterial bile duct colonization in perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and its clinical significance.,Scientific reports,"Abdominal infections including cholangitis represent a major problem in patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA). Thus, we investigated bacterial colonization of the bile ducts and determined its impact on postoperative outcome focusing on abdominal infections. A cohort of 95 pCCA patients who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2019 with available intraoperative microbial bile cultures were analyzed regarding bile duct colonization and postoperative abdominal infection by group comparisons and logistic regressions. 84.2% (80/95) showed bacterial colonization of the bile ducts and 54.7% (52/95) developed postoperative abdominal infections. Enterococcus faecalis (38.8%, 31/80), Enterococcus faecium (32.5%, 26/80), Enterobacter cloacae (16.3%, 13/80) and Escherichia coli (11.3%, 9/80) were the most common bacteria colonizing the bile ducts and Enterococcus faecium (71.2%, 37/52), Enterococcus faecalis (30.8%, 16/52), Enterobacter cloacae (25.0%, 13/52) and Escherichia coli (19.2%, 10/52) the most common causes of postoperative abdominal infection. Further, reduced susceptibility to perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis (OR = 10.10, p = .007) was identified as independent predictor of postoperative abdominal infection. Bacterial colonization is common in pCCA patients and reduced susceptibility of the bacteria to the intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is an independent predictor of postoperative abdominal infections.

WGS surveillance of six common multidrug-resistant organisms (
Expected hospital costs, counts of patient infections and colonisations, and deaths from bloodstream infections.
In 2021, 97 539 patients in Queensland are expected to be infected or colonised with one of six multidrug-resistant organisms with standard of care testing. WGS surveillance strategy and earlier infection control measures could avoid 36 726 infected or colonised patients and avoid 650 deaths. The total cost under standard of care was $A170.8 million in 2021. WGS surveillance costs an additional $A26.8 million but was offset by fewer costs for cleaning, nursing, personal protective equipment, shorter hospital stays and antimicrobials to produce an overall cost savings of $30.9 million in 2021. Sensitivity analyses showed cost savings remained when input values were varied at 95% confidence limits.
Compared with standard of care, WGS surveillance at a state-wide level could prevent a substantial number of hospital patients infected with multidrug-resistant organisms and related deaths and save healthcare costs.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 196 LVRE cases observed from 1st January 2012 to 31th December 2018. Patients' medical charts were reviewed and available LVRE (n = 102) were subjected to whole-genome-sequencing. Antibiotic consumption was measured in defined daily dose (DDD)/100 bed-days (BD).
The prevalence of LVRE isolates among VRE was 6.3 % in 2018. Most patients had an onco-hematological disease (134/196, 68.4 %). From 2012-2018 an increase of +356.7 % of linezolid defined daily dose/100 bed-days was observed. In 71.4 % (90/126, 70 missing values) of the patients, linezolid was prescribed in the previous 6 months. The median exposure to linezolid was 15 days (Interquartile, IQR 9-23). 42/196 (21.4 %) patients had an LVRE-related infection with an overall 30-day mortality rate of 33 %. In 121/196 (61.7 %) patients, linezolid-susceptible VREfm were isolated before LVRE, suggesting secondary acquisition of linezolid resistance. Genetic analysis revealed that most isolates belonged to ST117 (64/102 available isolates, 62.7 %).

By reducing the microbial load on eggs, food-borne-associated outbreaks can be reduced while good chick health is maintained. Pulsed ultraviolet (PUV) light system delivers an energy-intense broad spectrum (100-1,100 nm) pulse derived from a xenon flashlamp. In recent years, PUV light has been shown to reduce microbial pathogens on the surface of shell eggs by using a static PUV light system. In this study, shell eggs were surface inoculated with Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecium and treated with PUV light using a modified egg candling conveyor that provided complete rotation of eggs under a flashlamp. Pulsed UV light treatment inactivated both microbial strains, with greater energy resulting in a greater germicidal response (P < 0.05).

33516275,Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance patterns of bacteria isolated from cerebrospinal fluid among children with bacterial meningitis in China from 2016 to 2018: a multicenter retrospective study.,Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,"Pediatric bacterial meningitis (PBM) remains a devastating disease that causes substantial neurological morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, there are few large-scale studies on the pathogens causing PBM and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns in China. The present multicenter survey summarized the features of the etiological agents of PBM and characterized their AMR patterns.
Patients diagnosed with PBM were enrolled retrospectively at 13 children's hospitals in China from 2016 to 2018 and were screened based on a review of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microbiology results. Demographic characteristics, the causative organisms and their AMR patterns were systematically analyzed.
Overall, 1193 CSF bacterial isolates from 1142 patients with PBM were obtained. The three leading pathogens causing PBM were Staphylococcus epidermidis (16.5%), Escherichia coli (12.4%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.6%). In infants under 3 months of age, the top 3 pathogens were E. coli (116/523; 22.2%), Enterococcus faecium (75/523; 14.3%), and S. epidermidis (57/523; 10.9%). However, in children more than 3 months of age, the top 3 pathogens were S. epidermidis (140/670; 20.9%), S. pneumoniae (117/670; 17.5%), and Staphylococcus hominis (57/670; 8.5%). More than 93.0% of E. coli isolates were sensitive to cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, amikacin and carbapenems, and the resistance rates to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ceftazidime were 49.4%, 49.2% and 26.4%, respectively. From 2016 to 2018, the proportion of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates (MRCoNS) declined from 80.5 to 72.3%, and the frequency of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates increased from 75.0 to 87.5%. The proportion of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli fluctuated between 44.4 and 49.2%, and the detection rate of ESBL production in Klebsiella pneumoniae ranged from 55.6 to 88.9%. The resistance of E. coli strains to carbapenems was 5.0%, but the overall prevalence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) was high (54.5%).
S. epidermidis, E. coli and S. pneumoniae were the predominant pathogens causing PBM in Chinese patients. The distribution of PBM causative organisms varied by age. The resistance of CoNS to methicillin and the high incidence of ESBL production among E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were concerning. CRKP poses a critical challenge for the treatment of PBM.",10.1186/s13756-021-00895-x,"[{'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Xiaoshan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, West

33515778,Characterization of oxazolidinone and phenicol resistance genes in non-clinical enterococcal isolates from Korea.,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,"To investigate the distribution and genetic characteristics of linezolid-resistant enterococci.
Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium strains were isolated from pigs, equipment, grounds, and employees of 19 Korean swine farms in 2017. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was then performed and linezolid resistance genes were detected via PCR. For genetic epidemiological characterization, multilocus sequence typing and whole-genome sequencing data were analysed.
Twenty-eightE. faecalis and five E. faecium strains were isolated from 1026 samples obtained from the 19 farms. Ten sequence types were identified among the E. faecalis strains, of which ST256 (42.9%) and ST86 (25%) were the most abundant. The oxazolidinone and phenicol resistance genes poxtA, optrA, and fexA were detected in isolates of E. faecalis (100%, 85.7%, and 67.9%, respectively) and E. faecium (100%, 60%, and 80%, respectively). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of linezolid in these isolates ranged from 2 mg/L to 12 mg/L. The whole-genome sequencing data indicated that fexA was located upstream of poxtA.
This is the first study to report the detection of poxtA in isolates that were both susceptible and resistant to linezolid in Korea. These results demonstrate the importance of antimicrobial resistance monitoring programmes, including regular antimicrobial susceptibility testing and resistance gene expression analysis, to facilitate the control of the spread of antibiotic resistance in non-clinical settings in Korea.",10.1016/j.jgar.2021.01.009,"[{'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'Young-Hee', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Korea University, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Cha', 'firstname': 'Min-Hyeok', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Food Safety and Evaluation, Department of Biotechnology, Korea University Graduate School, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Woo', 'firstname': 'Gun-Jo', 'initials': 'GJ', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Food Safety and Evaluation, Department of Biotechnology, Korea University Graduate School, Seoul, 02841, Republic of Korea.

33515726,Characterization of a novel theta-type plasmid pSM409 of Enterococcus faecium RME isolated from raw milk.,Gene,"Enterococcal plasmids have generated renewed interest for their indispensable role in pathogenesis and dissemination of multidrug-resistance. Recently, a novel plasmid pSM409 (4303-bp, GC% = 33.6%), devoid of antibiotic-resistance and virulence genes, has been identified in Enterococcus faecium RME, isolated from raw milk by us. pSM409 contains six open reading frames encoding a replication initiator protein (RepB) and five accessory proteins: antitoxin epsilon, bacteriocin immunity protein, HsdS, and two hypothetical proteins. Comparative sequence analysis of pSM409 reveals a mosaic pattern of similarity with different loci obtained from different theta plasmids, which dictates the plasmid to be heterogeneous or mosaic, possibly due to recombination. The pSM409 comprised of a typical theta-type origin of replication with four and a half direct repeats (iterons) of 22 nucleotides. The pSM409-RepB shared 76-82% homology with the RepB of reported theta plasmids from different genera, with dissimilarities mostly in its DNA-binding and C-terminal domain. The RepB sequence-based phylogenetic tree revealed its distinct position relative to the reported ones. The RepB grouped in the same clade has identical DNA-binding domains and their cognate iterons, possibly due to their sequence-specific interaction to initiate plasmid replication. Comparative analysis of the pSM409-iteron reveals that the repeats markedly differed from their closest homologues. This clade-specific relationship provides a new concept of classifying theta plasmids. The theta-type replicon identified in pSM409 has been found to be unique to E. faecium RME, prompting us to further investigate its utility as a vector for genetic manipulation of enterococci for health and industry.",10.1016/j.gene.2021.145459,"[{'lastname': 'Kazi', 'firstname': 'Tawsif Ahmed', 'initials': 'TA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Botany, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan 731235, West Bengal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mitra', 'firstname': 'Suranjita', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Botany, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan 731235, West Bengal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mukhopadhyay', 'firstname': 'Bidhan Chandra', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Botany, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan 731235, West Bengal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mandal', 'firstname': 'Sukhendu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Molecular Bacteriology, Department of Microbiology, University of Calcutta, 35, Ballygunge Circular Road, Kolkata 700019, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ranjan Biswas', 'firstname': 'Swadesh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Botany, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan 731235, West Bengal, India.

Commercial lactose and isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were also evaluated as inducers for comparison of enzyme expression levels. The enzymatic extracts were purified by affinity chromatography, characterized, and applied in the bioconversion of D-galactose into D-tagatose. L-AI presented a catalytic activity of 1.67 ± 0.14, 1.52 ± 0.01, and 0.7 ± 0.04 U/mL, when expressed using commercial lactose, lactose from whey, and IPTG, respectively. Higher activities could be obtained by changing the protocol of enzyme extraction and, for instance, the enzymatic extract produced with whey presented a catalytic activity of 3.8 U/mL. The specific activity of the enzyme extracts produced using lactose (commercial or residual whey) after enzyme purification was also higher when compared to the enzyme expressed with IPTG. Best results were achieved when enzyme expression was conducted using 4 g/L of residual whey lactose for 11 h. These results proved the efficacy of an alternative and economic protocol for the effective expression of a recombinant L-AI aiming its high-scale production.","10.1007/s12033-021-00301-2

33500490,Oral administration of resveratrol or lactic acid bacterium improves lens elasticity.,Scientific reports,"A decrease in the elasticity of the ocular lens during aging is associated with loss of the accommodative ability of the eye, leading to presbyopia. Although near vision impairment is a social issue affecting the length of healthy life expectancy and productivity of elderly people, an effective treatment to improve near vision has not yet become available. Here we examined the effect of Enterococcus faecium WB2000, Lactobacillus pentosus TJ515, and resveratrol on lens elasticity in rats, where the stiffness of the ocular lens increases exponentially during the aging process. A combination of WB2000 and resveratrol improved lens elasticity not only in the long term but also with just short-term treatment. In addition, TJ515 decreased stiffness in the eye lens with long-term treatment. Therefore, the oral administration of WB2000 and resveratrol or TJ515 may be a potential approach for managing the progression of near vision impairment.",10.1038/s41598-021-81748-w,"[{'lastname': 'Nagashima', 'firstname': 'Hayato', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.\nDepartment of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sasaki', 'firstname': 'Nobunari', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.\nTsubota Laboratory, Inc., Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Amano', 'firstname': 'Sachie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakamura', 'firstname': 'Shigeru', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayano', 'firstname': 'Motoshi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.\nTsubota Laboratory, Inc., Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsubota', 'firstname': 'Kazuo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan. tsubota@z3.keio.jp.\nTsubota Laboratory, Inc., Tokyo, Japan. tsubota@z3.keio.jp.'}]"

33499465,Epidemiology and Outcomes of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus Infections in the U.S. Military Health System.,Military medicine,"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are classified by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention as a serious antibiotic resistance threat. Our study aims to characterize the epidemiology, associated conditions, and outcomes of VRE infections among hospitalized patients in the U.S. military health system (MHS).
We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with VRE infection using the MHS database. Cases included all patients admitted to a military treatment facility for ≥2 days from October 2008 to September 2015 with a clinical culture growing Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus species (unspecified), reported as resistant to vancomycin. Co-morbid conditions and procedures associated with VRE infection were identified by multivariable conditional logistic regression. Patient case-mix adjusted outcomes including in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospitalization cost were evaluated by high-dimensional propensity score adjustment.
During the seven-year study period and among 1,161,335 hospitalized patients within the MHS, we identified 577 (0.05%) patients with VRE infection. A majority of VRE infections were urinary tract infections (57.7%), followed by bloodstream (24.7%), other site/device-related (12.9%), respiratory (2.9%), and wound infections (1.8%). Risk factors for VRE infection included invasive gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and urologic procedures, indwelling devices, and exposure to 4th generation cephalosporins, but not to glycopeptides. Patients hospitalized with VRE infection had significantly higher hospitalization costs (attributable difference [AD] $135,534, P<0.001), prolonged hospital stays (AD 20.44 days, P<0.001, and higher in-hospital mortality (case-mix adjusted odds ratio 5.77; 95% confidence interval 4.59-7.25).
VRE infections carry a considerable burden for hospitalized patients given their impact on length of stay, hospitalization costs, and in-hospital mortality. Active surveillance and infection control efforts should target those identified as high-risk for VRE infection. Antimicrobial stewardship programs should focus on limiting exposure to 4th generation cephalosporins.",10.1093/milmed/usaa229,"[{'lastname': 'Stagliano', 'firstname': 'David R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Susi', 'firstname': 'Apryl', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Adams', 'firstname': 'Daniel J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA 23708, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nylund', 'firstname': 'Cade M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.'}]"

The objective of this study was to determine the level of inactivation provided by hot-air drying on a Salmonella cocktail inoculated onto apple cubes and to evaluate the performance of Enterococcus faecium as a surrogate. A cocktail of Salmonella serovars (Agona, Tennessee, Montevideo, Mbandaka, and Reading) and E. faecium were individually inoculated onto cored, peeled Gala apple cubes at 9.2 ± 0.3 and 8.8 ± 0.1 log CFU per sample, respectively. Apple cubes were dried at 104 or 135°C in ∼1.5-kg batches using a hot-air dryer with a vertically directed heat source and without mixing. Three subsamples, consisting of four inoculated cubes, were enumerated at each time point (n ≥ 5) from multiple product bed depths. Water activity decreased throughout the duration of the study, with samples drying faster at 135 than 104°C. Samples at the bottom bed depth, closer to the heat source, dried faster than those at the higher bed depth, regardless of temperature. Significant microbial inactivation was not seen immediately. It took >10 min at the bottom bed depth or >40 min of drying at the top bed depth, regardless of temperature (P < 0.05). By the end of drying, average Salmonella inactivation of greater than 5 log CFU per sample was achieved. At temperature conditions evaluated, E. faecium inactivation was slower than Salmonella, indicating that it would likely serve as a good surrogate for in-plant validation studies. Case hardening did not inhibit microbial inactivation in the conditions tested.

Combination antibiotic therapies have a distinct advantage over monotherapies in terms of their synergistic effect. In the study, it was aimed to investigate in vitro activity of vancomycin combined with fosfomycin by agar dilution method against VRE strains.
A total of 30 clinical VRE strains were included in the study. Bacterial identifications of the strains were undertaken using conventional routine methods. The resistance to vancomycin was investigated using the broth microdilution method compared to fosfomycin by agar dilution method, and the results were interpreted in accordance with the CLSI guidelines. All experiments contained 25 mg/mL glucose-6-phosphate for fosfomycin. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indexes (FICI) were interpreted as synergism, FICI ≤ 0.5. Additionally, two strains in 30 VRE were studied to determine the time-kill curves to verify the synergistic results. Both antibiotics were studied at 1 x MIC in the tests. Viable counts were determined at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24-hour intervals. Time-kill curves were constructed by plotting mean colony forming unit counts versus time.

33484057,Characterization and identification of cellulase-producing Enterococcus species isolated from Tibetan yak (Bos grunniens) rumen and their application in various forage silages.,Journal of applied microbiology,"Cellulase-producing Enterococcus species isolated from the rumen of Tibetan yak (Bos grunniens) were characterized, and their combined effects on the silage quality of various forages were studied.
The two isolated strains with high cellulolytic potential were identified as Enterococcus faecalis (EF85) and E. faecium (EF83) by 16S rRNA sequencing. Both EF85 and EF83 could grow well at 15-55°C, pH 3·0-6·0 and in 3·0-6·5% NaCl. The cellulase secreted by EF85 and EF83 showed good stability at temperatures from 20 to 45°C and pH from 4·5 to 7·0. A commercial inoculant (CLP), a commercial cellulase (CE) and the two cellulolytic strains (EF85 + EF83) were added to whole-crop corn, sweet sorghum and Napier grass ensiling for 120 days respectively. In Napier grass silage, all inoculants significantly increased lactic acid content and ratio of lactic to acetic acid and decreased pH, butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen contents. The acid detergent fibre and cellulose contents in EF85 + EF83 treatment were significantly lower than those in the other treatments. In whole-crop corn and sweet sorghum silages, all additives had no significant effect on the fermentation quality, while CE and EF85 + EF83 markedly enhanced cellulose degradation and increased free sugar content.
The combined inoculation of the cellulolytic strain EF85 and EF83 to various forages reduced the fibre content of the resulting silages.
Few studies involved inoculation of silage with Enterococcus species in different forage types. The isolated cellulolytic strains of E. faecalis EF85 and E. faecium EF83 could be a great alternative for commercial inoculants and enzymes in silage production.",10.1111/jam.15014,"[{'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Ensiling and Processing of Grass, College of Agro-Grassland Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shao', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Ensiling and Processing of Grass, College of Agro-Grassland Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Ensiling and Processing of Grass, College of Agro-Grassland Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tao', 'firstname': 'X', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Ensiling and Processing of Grass, College of Agro-Grassland Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Ensiling and Processing of Grass, College of Agro-Grassland Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.'}]"

33472670,Mode and dynamics of vanA-type vancomycin resistance dissemination in Dutch hospitals.,Genome medicine,"Enterococcus faecium is a commensal of the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans but also a causative agent of hospital-acquired infections. Resistance against glycopeptides and to vancomycin has motivated the inclusion of E. faecium in the WHO global priority list. Vancomycin resistance can be conferred by the vanA gene cluster on the transposon Tn1546, which is frequently present in plasmids. The vanA gene cluster can be disseminated clonally but also horizontally either by plasmid dissemination or by Tn1546 transposition between different genomic locations.
We performed a retrospective study of the genomic epidemiology of 309 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) isolates across 32 Dutch hospitals (2012-2015). Genomic information regarding clonality and Tn1546 characterization was extracted using hierBAPS sequence clusters (SC) and TETyper, respectively. Plasmids were predicted using gplas in combination with a network approach based on shared k-mer content. Next, we conducted a pairwise comparison between isolates sharing a potential epidemiological link to elucidate whether clonal, plasmid, or Tn1546 spread accounted for vanA-type resistance dissemination.
On average, we estimated that 59% of VRE cases with a potential epidemiological link were unrelated which was defined as VRE pairs with a distinct Tn1546 variant. Clonal dissemination accounted for 32% cases in which the same SC and Tn1546 variants were identified. Horizontal plasmid dissemination accounted for 7% of VRE cases, in which we observed VRE pairs belonging to a distinct SC but carrying an identical plasmid and Tn1546 variant. In 2% of cases, we observed the same Tn1546 variant in distinct SC and plasmid types which could be explained by mixed and consecutive events of clonal and plasmid dissemination.
In related VRE cases, the dissemination of the vanA gene cluster in Dutch hospitals between 2012 and 2015 was dominated by clonal spread. However, we also identified outbreak settings with high frequencies of plasmid dissemination in which the spread of resistance was mainly driven by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This study demonstrates the feasibility of distinguishing between modes of dissemination with short-read data and provides a novel assessment to estimate the relative contribution of nested genomic elements in the dissemination of vanA-type resistance.",10.1186/s13073-020-00825-3,"[{'lastname': 'Arredondo-Alonso', 'firstname': 'Sergio', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Biostatistics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Top', 'firstname': 'Janetta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Corander', 'firstname': 'Jukka', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.\nPathogen Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK.\nDepartment of Mathematics and Statistics, Helsinki Institute of Information Technology (HIIT), FI-00014 University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Willems', 'firstname': 'Rob J L', 'initials': 'RJL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Schürch', 'firstname': 'Anita C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. a.c.schurch@umcutrecht.nl.'}]"
33472048,Mobile genetic elements beyond the VanB-resistance dissemination among hospital-associated enterococci and other Gram-positive bacteria.,Plasmid,"An increasing resistance to vancomycin among clinically relevant enterococci, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium is a cause of a great concern, as it seriously limits treatment options. The vanB operon is one of most common determinants of this type of resistance. Genes constituting the operon are located in conjugative transposons, such as Tn1549-type transposons or, more rarely, in ICEEfaV583-type structures. Such elements show differences in structure and size, and reside in various sites of bacterial chromosome or, in the case of Tn1549-type transposons, are also occasionally associated with plasmids of divergent replicon types. While conjugative transposition contributes to the acquisition of Tn1549-type transposons from anaerobic gut commensals by enterococci, chromosomal recombination and conjugal transfer of plasmids appear to represent main mechanisms responsible for horizontal dissemination of vanB determinants among hospital E. faecalis and E. faecium. This review focuses on diversity of genetic elements harbouring vanB determinants in hospital-associated strains of E. faecium and E. faecalis, the mechanisms beyond vanB spread in populations of these bacteria, and provides an overview of the vanB-MGE distribution among other enterococci and Gram-positive bacteria as potential reservoirs of vanB genes.",10.1016/j.plasmid.2021.102558,"[{'lastname': 'Sadowy', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Microbiology, National Medicines Institute, Warsaw, Poland.

Nosiheptide (NOS) has excellent lethality against a variety of Gram-positive bacteria, however the physical and chemical drawbacks hamper its routine application in clinical practice. In this study, by using NOS as the starting material, a total of 15 NOS analogues (2a-4e) were semi-synthesized via its dehydroalanine residue reacting with monosubstituted anilines. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of NOS and its analogues against two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution assay to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing data shown that most of the NOS analogues had a better antibacterial effect than the parent compound, with compound 3c exhibiting the highest antibacterial activity against VRE (MIC = 0.0078 mg/L) and MRSA (MIC < 0.0039 mg/L). Molecular docking of synthetic compounds was also performed to verify the binding interactions of NOS analogues with the target. Our data indicated that compound 3c possesses stronger and more complex intermolecular force than other analogues, which is consistent with the results of the biological activity evaluation. Overall, this study identified a number of potential antibacterial NOS analogues that could act as potent therapeutic agents for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.",10.1016/j.bmc.2020.115970,"[{'lastname': 'Fan', 'firstname': 'Yafei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Fluorine Chemistry and Chemical Materials, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan 250022, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Hangfei', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310016, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Mu', 'firstname': 'Ning', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Fluorine Chemistry and Chemical Materials, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan 250022, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Wengui', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Fluorine Chemistry and Chemical Materials, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, University of Jinan, Jinan 250022, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Kongkai', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan, Jinan 250022, China; Drug Discovery and Design Center, State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.

33422729,Protection of the intestinal epithelium of poultry against deleterious effects of dietary lectins by a multi-strain bacterial supplement.,Research in veterinary science,"The intake of antinutritional factors produce impairment on the intestinal digestive function, impeding the efficient use of nutrients. Probiotics could be useful in poultry breeding to prevent negative effects of antinutritional factors, like the dietary lectins soybean agglutinin (SBA) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Therefore, this investigation aimed to verify that SBA and wheat, which contains WGA, exert harmful effects on the intestinal mucosa and the digestive system of young poultry, and determine if the administration of probiotics able to capture lectins could counteract their effects. The trials performed demonstrated that a mixture of Bifidobacterium infantis CRL 1395, Enterococcus faecium LET 301, Lactobacillus salivarius LET 201, L. reuteri LET 210, and Propionibacterium acidipropionici LET 103, strains with ex vivo ability to interfere with the interaction of lectins and epithelial cells, has no negative effect on young chickens health. Middle levels of SBA, as well as wheat as a source of WGA, resulted in lower activities of intestinal and brush border enzymes and alterations in the integrity and morphological parameters of the chicks jejunal mucosa. The bacteria blend increased the activity of several digestive enzymes and the intestinal maturation marker alkaline phosphatase in birds fed with a conventional diet. Besides, it partially countered the deleterious effects of increased content of SBA, as well as the negative effect of a dietary source of WGA, on digestive enzymes activity and intestinal mucosa integrity.

Spreading of VREfm can occur both clonally and by the dissemination of mobile genetic elements.
To report prospective analysis of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, including both core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) and transposon analysis, during a vanB VREfm outbreak.
Screening for vanB-positive VREfm isolates was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on an overnight enriched broth and, if positive, subculture was performed. vanB-positive VREfm isolates underwent WGS. Generated data were used for molecular typing that was performed by cgMLST using SeqSphere. For transposon characterization, sequence data were mapped against the reference sequence of transposon Tn1549 using CLC Genomics Workbench, or de-novo assemblies were used for BLASTN comparisons.
In total, 1358 real-time PCRs were performed. Two hundred and fifty-one specimens from 207 patients tested positive on PCR for vanB, of which 13 specimens obtained from six patients were identified as vanB VREfm positive on culture. These six patients harboured seven unique isolates belonging to four cluster types: CT118 (N=2), CT2483 (N=3), CT2500 (N=1) and CT2501 (N=1). Transposon analysis revealed the presence of an identical vanB-carrying transposon in the isolates cultured from all six patients that could be linked based on epidemiological data.
A vanB VREfm outbreak occurred in the study hospital, including six patients with isolates belonging to four cluster types.

Three trials were conducted with artisan cheeses made from traditionally ""boiled"" (85°C) ewe's milk. The milk was cooled at 42°C and divided in two treatments. A1 milk was inoculated with Streptococcus thermophilus ST1 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris M78, and A2 was inoculated with the basic starter ST1+M78 plus KE82 (step 1). All milks were fermented at 20 to 22°C for 24 h (step 2), and the curds were drained at 12°C for 72 h (step 3) and then salted with 1.5 to 1.8% salt to obtain the fresh Galotyri cheeses (step 4). These fresh cheeses were then ripened at 4°C for 30 days (step 5). Because artificial listerial contamination in the dairy plant was prohibited, samples of A1 and A2 cheese milk (200 mL) or curd (200 g) were collected after steps 1 through 5, inoculated with L. monocytogenes 10 (3 to 4 log CFU/mL or g), incubated at 37, 22, 12, and 4°C for predefined periods, and analyzed for microbial levels and pH.

The final net reductions in Listeria populations were 2.00-, 1.07-, 0.54-, and 0.61-log greater in the A2 than in the A1 curd portions after steps 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. In step 1, conducted to simulate the whole cheese milk fermentation process, L. monocytogenes levels declined by 1.47 log CFU/mL more in the A2 than in the A1 milk portions after 72 h at 22°C; however, slight growth (0.6 log CFU/mL) occurred during the first 6 h at 37°C. E. faecium KE82 was compatible with the starter culture and enhanced inactivation of L. monocytogenes during all steps of Galotyri cheese processing. The antilisterial effects of the combined acid and enterocin were the weakest in the fermenting milks, the strongest in the unsalted fermented curds, and declined again in the salted fresh cheeses.",10.4315/JFP-20-278,"[{'lastname': 'Sameli', 'firstname': 'Nikoletta', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Dairy Research Institute, General Directorate of Agricultural Research, Hellenic Agricultural Organization DEMETER, Katsikas, 45221 Ioannina, Greece.\nLaboratory of Food Quality Control and Hygiene, Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Agricultural University of Athens, Iera Odos 75, Votanikos, 11855 Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Skandamis', 'firstname': 'Panagiotis N', 'initials': 'PN', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Food Quality Control and Hygiene, Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Agricultural University of Athens, Iera Odos 75, Votanikos, 11855 Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Samelis', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Dairy Research Institute, General Directorate of Agricultural Research, Hellenic Agricultural Organization DEMETER, Katsikas, 45221 Ioannina, Greece.\n(ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4921-5649 [J.S.]).'}]"
33407856,Economic burden of antibiotic resistance in China: a national level estimate for inpatients.,Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) threats public health in China. National-level estimation of economic burden of AR is lacking. We aimed to quantify the economic costs of AR in inpatients in China.
We performed a multicentre and retrospective cohort study including 15,990 patient episodes at four tertiary hospitals in China from 2013 to 2015 to assess the impact of AR on hospital mortality, length of stay, and costs. We estimated the societal economic burden of AR using findings from the cohort study and secondary data from national surveillance hubs and statistical reports.
Patients with multi-drug resistant (MDR) infection or colonisation caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii experienced higher individual patient cost ($3391, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) $3188-3594), longer hospital stay (5.48 days, 95% UI 5.10-5.87 days), and higher in-hospital mortality rates (1.50%, 95% UI 1.29-1.70%). In China, 27.45% of bacterial infection or colonisation that occurred in inpatients were resistant, of which 15.77% were MDR. A societal economic burden attributed to AR was estimated to be $77 billion in 2017, which is equivalent to 0.37% of China's yearly gross domestic product, with $57 billion associated with MDR.
This is the first study to estimate national-level economic burden of AR in China. AR places a significant burden on patient health and healthcare systems. Estimation of economic costs of resistant infection or colonisation is the essential step towards building an economic case for global and national actions to combat AMR.",10.1186/s13756-020-00872-w,"[{'lastname': 'Zhen', 'firstname': 'Xuemei', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Center for Health Policy Studies, School of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.\nCentre for Health Management and Policy Research, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, (NHC Key Laboratory of Health Economics and Policy Research), Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Stålsby Lundborg', 'firstname': 'Cecilia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Global Public Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Xueshan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Center for Health Policy Studies, School of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Nina', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit (HPRU) in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance (HCAIs & AMR), Department of Infectious Disease, Imperial College, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gu', 'firstname': 'Shuyan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Health Policy Studies, School of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.\nCenter for Health Policy and Management Studies, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Hengjin', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Center for Health Policy Studies, School of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China. donghj@zju.edu.cn.\nThe Fourth Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Yiwu, China. donghj@zju.edu.cn.'}]"
33404518,Investigation of the environmental presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at small animal hospitals in Hungary.,Acta veterinaria Hungarica,"Multidrug-resistant bacteria can cause severe nosocomial infections in both human and veterinary clinics. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and antibiotic susceptibility of Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas strains at four small animal clinics of Hungary in 2018, as these bacteria can reliably represent the level of antimicrobial resistance in the investigated environment. A total of 177 Staphylococcus colonies were found, including 22 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and 13 Staphylococcus aureus. As regards enterococci, 9 Enterococcus faecium, 2 E. faecalis and further 286 Enterococcus strains were isolated. The number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (n = 34) was considered too low for relevant susceptibility testing. Among staphylococci, the highest resistance was found to sulphamethoxazole (82.9%), penicillin (65.7%) and erythromycin (54.3%), while in the case of enterococci, resistance to norfloxacin and rifampicin was the most common, with 25.5% of the strains being resistant to both antibiotics. Ten methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) and six vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains could be identified. Only 5.7% of the Staphylococcus isolates were susceptible to all tested agents, while this ratio was 36.2% among enterococci. The results of this study have revealed a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in Hungarian small animal clinics, which highlights the importance of regular disinfection processes and stringent hygiene measures in veterinary clinics.",10.1556/004.2020.00055,"[{'lastname': 'Kerek', 'firstname': 'Ádám', 'initials': 'Á', 'affiliation': '1Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, István u. 2, H-1078 Budapest, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Sterczer', 'firstname': 'Ágnes', 'initials': 'Á', 'affiliation': '2Department and Clinic of Internal Medicine, University of Veterinary Medicine, István u. 2, H-1078 Budapest, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Somogyi', 'firstname': 'Zoltán', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': '1Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, István u. 2, H-1078 Budapest, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Kovács', 'firstname': 'Dóra', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': '1Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, István u. 2, H-1078 Budapest, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Jerzsele', 'firstname': 'Ákos', 'initials': 'Á', 'affiliation': '1Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, István u. 2, H-1078 Budapest, Hungary.'}]"

There is no report on probiotic characters of LAB isolated from dry starters. Hence, we screened the probiotic and some functional properties of 37 LAB strains isolated from dry starters of the Eastern Himalayas viz. marcha, phab, paa, pee and phut. About 38% of the LAB strains showed high survival rate (> 50%) at pH 3 and 0.3% bile salts. Enterococcus durans BPB21 and SMB7 showed the highest hydrophobicity percentage of 98%. E. durans DMB4 and SMB7 showed maximum cholesterol assimilation activity. About 65% of the LAB strains showed the ability to produce β galactosidase. Majority of the strains showed phytase activity, whereas none of the strain showed amylase activity. About 86% of LAB strains showed an optimum tolerance of 10% ethanol concentration. Genetic screening of some probiotic and functional marker genes have also been analysed. The occurrence of clp L gene, agu A gene (survival of gastrointestinal tract conditions), apf, mub1 and map A gene (adhesion genes) was higher compared to other genes. The occurrence of bsh gene (bile salt tolerance) was detected in Pediococcus pentosaceus SMB13-1 and Enterococcus faecium BPB11. Gene ped B for pediocin with amplicon size of 375 bp was detected in E. durans DMB13 and Pediococcus acidilactici AKB3. Detection of nutritional marker gene rib A and fol P in some strains showed the potential ability to synthesize riboflavin and folic acid.

33376361,Effect of the Short-Term Use of Fluoroquinolone and β-Lactam Antibiotics on Mouse Gut Microbiota.,Infection and drug resistance,"Antibiotics play an important role in the treatment of infectious diseases. However, the overuse of antibiotics increases the spread of drug-resistant bacteria and causes dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota. Few studies have addressed the longitudinal effects of antibiotics on the microbiome and host immunity.
In this study, the short-term effect of fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) and β-lactam antibiotics (meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and aztreonam) on the gut microbiota of mice was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The susceptibility of 
Our results showed that 4-day antibiotic exposure significantly reduced the alpha and beta diversity of gut bacteria and increased serum inflammatory cytokines, and these changes persisted long after antibiotic withdrawal and did not return to pre-treatment levels. Nonetheless, the bacterial community composition tended to return to pre-treatment levels after discontinuing treatment. The tested probiotic strains were resistant to aztreonam but were sensitive to meropenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam.
Short-term antibiotic treatment led to significant changes in the intestinal flora with a tendency to recover. The antibiotics had different effects on the intestinal microbial community and probiotic strains. This study provides guidance for the concomitant use of probiotics and antibiotics, and the results emphasize the importance of using broad-spectrum antibiotics responsibly to prevent the long-term disruption of the native microbiota.",10.2147/IDR.S281274,"[{'lastname': 'Gu', 'firstname': 'Si-Lan', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Yiwen', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Jiaying', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yunbo', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Zhengjie', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Qiaomai', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Fang', 'firstname': 'Yunhui', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jingxia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Ling-Ling', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': ""Shulan (Hangzhou) Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Shuren University, Shulan International Medical College, Hangzhou 310000, People's Republic of China.""}]"
