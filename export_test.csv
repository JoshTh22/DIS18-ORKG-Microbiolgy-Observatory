24501647,"Genome sequence of Frateuria aurantia type strain (Kondô 67(T)), a xanthomonade isolated from Lilium auratium Lindl.",Standards in genomic sciences,"Frateuria aurantia (ex Kondô and Ameyama 1958) Swings et al. 1980 is a member of the bispecific genus Frateuria in the family Xanthomonadaceae, which is already heavily targeted for non-type strain genome sequencing. Strain Kondô 67(T) was initially (1958) identified as a member of 'Acetobacter aurantius', a name that was not considered for the approved list. Kondô 67(T) was therefore later designated as the type strain of the newly proposed acetogenic species Frateuria aurantia . The strain is of interest because of its triterpenoids (hopane family). F. aurantia Kondô 67(T) is the first member of the genus Frateura whose genome sequence has been deciphered, and here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. The 3,603,458-bp long chromosome with its 3,200 protein-coding and 88 RNA genes is a part of the G enomic E ncyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project.

33812722,Frequency and associated factors for carbapenem-non-susceptible Bacteroides fragilis group bacteria colonization in hospitalized patients: Case control study in a university hospital in Turkey.,Indian journal of medical microbiology,"The carbapenem-resistant Bacteroides fragilis group (CR-BFG) bacteria have been reported in several countries recently with increasing global attention. The high incidence of CR-BFG isolated from our hospitalized patients has become an important problem. Therefore, we aimed to determine the frequency and associated factors for intestinal colonization by carbapenem-non-susceptible BFG (CNS-BFG) among adult patients hospitalized at intensive care units, neurosurgery and internal medicine wards in our hospital.
Rectal swabs (n = 1200), collected from 766 patients between February 2014 and March 2015, were inoculated onto kanamycin-vancomycin-leaked blood agar containing 0.125 mg/L meropenem. The isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution method. The carbapenemase gene (cfiA) was detected by PCR. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associated factors for intestinal colonization by CNS-BFG.
A total 180 non-duplicate BFG isolates were obtained from 164 patients. Ten different species, including Parabacteroides distasonis (n = 46, 25.6%), and Bacteroides fragilis (n = 30; 16.6%), were identified. Twenty-five percent of the isolates were non-susceptible to meropenem (MIC >2 mg/L). The highest prevalence of meropenem resistant strains (MIC >8 mg/L) was detected among B. fragilis (n = 12), followed by Parabacteroides spp. (n = 4). All but one B. fragilis strains were cfiA gene positive. Hospital admission, increasing Charlson score, use of antibiotics; including carbapenems in past three months, colonization with other accompanying carbapenem-resistant Gram negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and having undergone surgical operations were significantly associated with RCS- BFG colonization.
The high carriage rate of CNS-BFG in hospitalized patients may lead to worse clinical outcomes, such as serious infections and mortality, and deserves attention.",10.1016/j.ijmmb.2021.03.018,"[{'lastname': 'Ulger Toprak', 'firstname': 'Nurver', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Marmara University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.

33811771,A clinical review and history of pubic lice.,Clinical and experimental dermatology,"The ectoparasite, Pthirus pubis (PtP), (crab or pubic louse) has plagued primates from pre-historic apes to Homo sapiens. We combed the literature from antiquity to present day using Medline and EMBASE, reviewing the pubic louse's origins, its evolution with mankind, presentation and management. Medline and EMBASE provided the greatest yield of literature compared to other databases. PtP incidence estimates range from 0.3-4.6% and prevalence around 2% in adults. War, disasters and overcrowding support lice transmission, but modern pubic hair grooming has reduced PtP in recent years. PtP, is usually found on pubic hair, but may infest scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes and body hair. Reports suggest the possibility of PtP as a vector for Bartonella spp. and Acinetobacter spp., requiring further studies. Transmission is via close contact, so sexual abuse and concomitant STIs should be considered. Symptoms and signs include: pruritus, red papules and rust/brown deposits from feeding or faecal matter. Visualisation of live lice confirms diagnosis. Long-standing treatments include hand-picking and combing, but in modern times pediculicidal products may generate faster resolution. Permethrin or pyrethrins are first-line recommendations. Resistance to pediculicides is common with head lice and is presumed likely in PtP although data are lacking. Pseudo-resistance occurs due to poor compliance, incorrect or ineffective dosing and reinfestation. In true resistance, a different pediculicide class should be used e.g., second-line agents: phenothrin, malathion or ivermectin. Lice have existed long before humans and given their adaptability, despite habitat challenges from fashion trends in body hair-removal, are likely to continue to survive.",10.1111/ced.14666,"[{'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'P U', 'initials': 'PU', 'affiliation': 'Norfolk and Norwich University Trust Hospital.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Genitourinary Medicine Department: iCASH Norwich, Cambridge community services NHS trust.'}, {'lastname': 'Levell', 'firstname': 'N J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': 'Norfolk and Norwich University Trust Hospital.'}]"
33836275,The anti-biofilm capability of nano-emodin-mediated sonodynamic therapy on multi-species biofilms produced by burn wound bacterial strains.,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,"Management of burn wound infections (BWIs) as an important health problem is especially difficult due to the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. This study aimed to explore the anti-biofilm efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) using nano-emodin (N-EMO) against multi-species bacterial biofilms containing Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii.
Following synthesis and confirmation of N-EMO as a sonosensitizer, the anti-biofilm efficacy of SDT against multi-species bacterial biofilms was determined using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC), and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of N-EMO. The reduction of multi-species bacterial biofilms was then evaluated following the treatments using Log reduction and crystal violet (CV) assays. In addition, the expression profiling of abaI, agrA, and lasI genes using SDT with sub-MIC, sub-MBIC, and sub-MBEC of N-EMO was assessed.
Successful synthesis of N-EMO was confirmed through several characterization tests. As the results demonstrated, the MIC value of N-EMO for the multi-species bacterial suspension was 0.15 × 10
These results highlight the potential of N-EMO-mediated SDT in inhibition of biofilm formation, degradation of formed biofilms, and reduction of virulence factor associated with biofilms of multi-species bacterial biofilms in BWIs.",10.1016/j.pdpdt.2021.102288,"[{'lastname': 'Pourhajibagher', 'firstname': 'Maryam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Dental Research Center, Dentistry Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Rahimi-Esboei', 'firstname': 'Bahman', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Tonekabone Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tonekabone, Iran; Toxoplasmosis Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahmadi', 'firstname': 'Hanie', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Polymer Engineering and Color Technology, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Bahador', 'firstname': 'Abbas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Fellowship in Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

33832538,Risk factors for nosocomial rectal colonization with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in hospital: a matched case-control study.,Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,"During the last decade carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) became hyper-endemic in hospitals due to difficult to control spreading. Our aim is to identify risk factors for nosocomial rectal CRAB colonization in an endemic hospital.
A retrospective matched case-control study (ratio 1:2) with a prospective inclusion of cases and concurrent selection of controls was conducted from January 2017 to December 2018 in a tertiary-care hospital. Universal active surveillance for CRAB was implemented. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was carried out using a stepwise selection method to compare prognostic factors between cases and controls. A sub-analysis was carried out according to the type of department.
Forty-five cases with nosocomial rectal CRAB colonization and 90 controls were included. One hundred and two (75%) patients were hospitalized in medical departments. At multivariable analysis significant risk factors associated with CRAB colonization were: use of permanent devices (OR 10.15, 95% CI 2.27-45.39; P = 0.002), mechanical ventilation (OR 40.01, 95% CI 4.05-395.1; P = 0.002), urinary catheters (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.52-16.19; P = 0.008), McCabe score (OR 5.45, 95% CI 1.87-15.89; P = 0.002), length of stay (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05; P = 0.002), carbapenem use (OR 5.39, 95% CI 1.14-25.44; P = 0.033). The sub-analysis showed that patients admitted to different departments had different risk factors. In geriatric department a fatal disease and a longer hospital stay represented significant risk factors both in univariate and multivariate analysis, while in internal medicine department the use of permanent devices, current antibiotic therapy and antibiotic polytherapy represented significant risk factors for CRAB at the univariate analysis, also confirmed in multivariate analysis.
Our data suggest that active surveillance for rectal CRAB colonization should be addressed to patients with an unfavourable prognosis, longer hospitalizations and carriers of multiple devices. To counter CRAB spreading in endemic settings, clinicians must limit the use of carbapenems, and reinforce interventions aimed at proper use of devices.","10.1186/s13756-021-00919-6

Isolates with a similarity equal to or greater than 87% were considered to be part of the same clonal group.
The analysis of the 21 isolates included in the study, resulted in 8 clonal groups using PFGE, 3 groups by MALDI-TOF MS and 7 groups by rep-PCR analysis.

We sought to describe and compare the bacterial profile of PLGs with a focus on common pathogens involved in surgical site infections (SSI) and prosthetic joint infections (PJI).
We studied body aprons and neck-thyroid protective shields. We sampled 20 body aprons and 21 neck PLGs, swabbing the inside and outside of the PLGs. Swabs were cultured on different media and the results were assessed and compared.
Of PLGs, 87.8% were contaminated. The neck-thyroid shield PLGs was generally more contaminated than body apron PLGs and exhibited significantly higher loads of 
PLGs are heavily contaminated despite regular cleaning protocols. Neck PLGs are highly contaminated with potentially infectious agents.

33328381,Evaluation of bacterial contamination and mutagenic potential of treated wastewater from Al-Samra wastewater treatment plant in Jordan.,Journal of water and health,"Jordan is one of the lowest countries in the world in terms of water resources. The reuse of treated wastewater is an important alternative to supply agricultural demands for water. In Jordan, Kherbet Al-Samra wastewater treatment plant (KSWWTP) is the largest and its effluent is mainly used for irrigation purposes. In this study, bacterial contamination and mutagenic potential were evaluated in six sites, beginning with KSWWTP and ending with King Tallal Dam. The results showed high contamination with many pathogenic bacteria and coliforms. The isolated pathogenic bacteria were Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. The isolated opportunistic pathogenic bacteria were Acinetobacter lwoffii, Elizabethkingia meningosepticum, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus licheniformis. These bacteria were found in all sampling sites without a specific prevalence pattern. Differences in temperature between seasons affect total coliform and other bacterial count. All water samples showed positive mutagenic activity and high bacterial pollution. Improving the disinfection efficiency in the wastewater treatment plant is important to minimize potential toxicity and exposure of public health to pathogenic bacteria, reduce water resources' contamination and environmental pollution. Increasing effluent sampling frequency from KSWWTP is required to monitor bacterial contamination and toxicity/mutagenicity level for water safety and public health risk assessments.",10.2166/wh.2020.193,"[{'lastname': 'Al-Quraan', 'firstname': 'Nisreen A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Science and Arts, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid 22110, Jordan E-mail: naquraan@just.edu.jo.'}, {'lastname': 'Abu-Rub', 'firstname': 'Lubna I', 'initials': 'LI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Science and Arts, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid 22110, Jordan E-mail: naquraan@just.edu.jo.'}, {'lastname': 'Sallal', 'firstname': 'Abdel-Kareem', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Science and Arts, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid 22110, Jordan E-mail: naquraan@just.edu.jo.'}]"

33827520,"Antibacterial effect of silver diamine fluoride and potassium iodide against E. faecalis, A. naeslundii and P. micra.",BMC oral health,"The aim of this study was to determine in vitro the bactericidal potential of 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF) alone, potassium iodide (PI) alone, and the two in combination (SDF + PI) against three bacterial species commonly found in root canal samples (Enterococcus faecalis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Parvimonas micra).
The potential bactericidal rates for SDF, PI and SDF + PI against E. faecalis, A. naeslundii and P. micra were calculated as reduction of bacteria colony forming units.
The bactericidal potential of SDF was at 99.97-100% against E. faecalis and 100% against A. naeslundii and P. micra. SDF + PI showed a 100% bactericidal effect against P. micra, 99.89-99.98% against E. faecalis and 99.98-100% against A. naeslundii. The bactericidal effect of PI was 99.51-99.98% against E. faecalis, 99.27-99.95% against A. naeslundii and 99.93-100% against P. micra. The differences between controls and bacteria exposed to the antibacterial agents were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
SDF had an effective bactericidal effect against the examined bacteria. However, the limitations of this in vitro study do not allow a recommendation of the employment of these solutions as root canal irrigants. Additional investigations are necessary to assess their endodontic clinical applicability.","10.1186/s12903-021-01531-1

After resuscitation, surgical exploration revealed a purulent pericardial effusion with tamponade and a liver abscess. Microbiological analyses from both sites were negative. Shortly after surgical exploration, she developed multiorgan failure and died. At autopsy, pus was observed both within the pericardial cavity and around the left lobe of the liver.

33830599,"D-canavanine affects peptidoglycan structure, morphogenesis and fitness in Rhizobiales.",Environmental microbiology,"The bacterial cell wall is made of peptidoglycan (PG), a polymer that is essential for maintenance of cell shape and survival. Many bacteria alter their PG chemistry as a strategy to adapt their cell wall to external challenges. Therefore, identifying these environmental cues is important to better understand the interplay between microbes and their habitat. Here we used the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida to uncover cell wall modulators from plant extracts and found canavanine (CAN), a non-proteinogenic amino acid. We demonstrated that cell wall chemical editing by CAN is licensed by P. putida BSAR, a broad-spectrum racemase which catalyzes production of DL-CAN from L-CAN, which is produced by many legumes. Importantly, D-CAN diffuses to the extracellular milieu thereby having a potential impact on other organisms inhabiting the same niche. Our results show that D-CAN alters dramatically the PG structure of Rhizobiales (e.g. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti), impairing PG crosslinkage and cell division. Using A. tumefaciens we demonstrated that the detrimental effect of D-CAN is suppressed by a single amino acid substitution in the cell division PG transpeptidase penicillin binding protein 3a. Collectively, this work highlights the role of amino acid racemization in cell wall chemical editing and fitness. This article is protected by copyright.

33824341,Biochemical and structural characterization of the BioZ enzyme engaged in bacterial biotin synthesis pathway.,Nature communications,"Biotin is an essential micro-nutrient across the three domains of life. The paradigm earlier step of biotin synthesis denotes ""BioC-BioH"" pathway in Escherichia coli. Here we report that BioZ bypasses the canonical route to begin biotin synthesis. In addition to its origin of Rhizobiales, protein phylogeny infers that BioZ is domesticated to gain an atypical role of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III. Genetic and biochemical characterization demonstrates that BioZ catalyzes the condensation of glutaryl-CoA (or ACP) with malonyl-ACP to give 5'-keto-pimeloyl ACP. This intermediate proceeds via type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) pathway, to initiate the formation of pimeloyl-ACP, a precursor of biotin synthesis. To further explore molecular basis of BioZ activity, we determine the crystal structure of Agrobacterium tumefaciens BioZ at 1.99 Å, of which the catalytic triad and the substrate-loading tunnel are functionally defined. In particular, we localize that three residues (S84, R147, and S287) at the distant bottom of the tunnel might neutralize the charge of free C-carboxyl group of the primer glutaryl-CoA. Taken together, this study provides molecular insights into the BioZ biotin synthesis pathway.","10.1038/s41467-021-22360-4

33824341,Biochemical and structural characterization of the BioZ enzyme engaged in bacterial biotin synthesis pathway.,Nature communications,"Biotin is an essential micro-nutrient across the three domains of life. The paradigm earlier step of biotin synthesis denotes ""BioC-BioH"" pathway in Escherichia coli. Here we report that BioZ bypasses the canonical route to begin biotin synthesis. In addition to its origin of Rhizobiales, protein phylogeny infers that BioZ is domesticated to gain an atypical role of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III. Genetic and biochemical characterization demonstrates that BioZ catalyzes the condensation of glutaryl-CoA (or ACP) with malonyl-ACP to give 5'-keto-pimeloyl ACP. This intermediate proceeds via type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) pathway, to initiate the formation of pimeloyl-ACP, a precursor of biotin synthesis. To further explore molecular basis of BioZ activity, we determine the crystal structure of Agrobacterium tumefaciens BioZ at 1.99 Å, of which the catalytic triad and the substrate-loading tunnel are functionally defined. In particular, we localize that three residues (S84, R147, and S287) at the distant bottom of the tunnel might neutralize the charge of free C-carboxyl group of the primer glutaryl-CoA. Taken together, this study provides molecular insights into the BioZ biotin synthesis pathway.","10.1038/s41467-021-22360-4

33750295,FixJ family regulator AcfR of Azorhizobium caulinodans is involved in symbiosis with the host plant.,BMC microbiology,"A wide variety of bacterial adaptative responses to environmental conditions are mediated by signal transduction pathways. Two-component signal transduction systems are one of the predominant means used by bacteria to sense the signals of the host plant and adjust their interaction behaviour. A total of seven open reading frames have been identified as putative two-component response regulators in the gram-negative nitrogen-fixing bacteria Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571. However, the biological functions of these response regulators in the symbiotic interactions between A. caulinodans ORS571 and the host plant Sesbania rostrata have not been elucidated to date.
In this study, we identified and investigated a two-component response regulator, AcfR, with a phosphorylatable N-terminal REC (receiver) domain and a C-terminal HTH (helix-turn-helix) LuxR DNA-binding domain in A. caulinodans ORS571. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AcfR possessed close evolutionary relationships with NarL/FixJ family regulators. In addition, six histidine kinases containing HATPase_c and HisKA domains were predicted to interact with AcfR. Furthermore, the biological function of AcfR in free-living and symbiotic conditions was elucidated by comparing the wild-type strain and the ΔacfR mutant strain. In the free-living state, the cell motility behaviour and exopolysaccharide production of the ΔacfR mutant were significantly reduced compared to those of the wild-type strain. In the symbiotic state, the ΔacfR mutant showed a competitive nodule defect on the stems and roots of the host plant, suggesting that AcfR can provide A. caulinodans with an effective competitive ability for symbiotic nodulation.
Our results showed that AcfR, as a response regulator, regulates numerous phenotypes of A. caulinodans under the free-living conditions and in symbiosis with the host plant. The results of this study help to elucidate the involvement of a REC + HTH_LuxR two-component response regulator in the Rhizobium-host plant interaction.",10.1186/s12866-021-02138-w,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Bioresource Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, 264003, China.\nLaboratory for Marine Biology and Biotechnology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266237, China.\nCenter for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Bai', 'firstname': 'Xue', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Bioresource Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, 264003, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Bioresource Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, 264003, China.\nLaboratory for Marine Biology and Biotechnology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266237, China.\nCenter for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Haikun', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Bioresource Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, 264003, China.\nLaboratory for Marine Biology and Biotechnology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266237, China.\nCenter for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Xiaoke', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Coastal Biology and Bioresource Utilization, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, 264003, China. xkhu@yic.ac.cn.\nLaboratory for Marine Biology and Biotechnology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, 266237, China. xkhu@yic.ac.cn.\nCenter for Ocean Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, China. xkhu@yic.ac.cn.'}]"

32483723,CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing shows the important role of AZC_2928 gene in nitrogen-fixing bacteria of plants.,Functional & integrative genomics,"AZC_2928 gene (GenBank accession no. BAF88926.1) of Azorhizobium caulinodans ORS571 has sequence homology to 2,3-aminomutases. However, its function is unknown. In this study, we are for the first time to knock out the gene completely in A. caulinodans ORS571 using the current advanced genome editing tool, CRISPR/Cas9. Our results show that the editing efficiency is 34% and AZC_2928 plays an extremely important role in regulating the formation of chemotaxis and biofilm. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of AZC_2928 (△AZC_2928) significantly enhanced chemotaxis and biofilm formation. Both chemotaxis and biofilm formation play an important role in nitrogen-fixing bacteria and their interaction with their host plants. Interestingly, AZC_2928 did not affect the motility of A. caulinodans ORS571 and the nodulation formation in their natural host plant, Sesbania rostrata. Due to rhizobia needing to form bacteroids for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in mature nodules, AZC_2928 might have a direct influence on nitrogen fixation efficiency rather than the number of nodulations.",10.1007/s10142-020-00739-8,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiaojing', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""College of Science, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Lv', 'firstname': 'Sang', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Tao', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Wei', 'firstname': 'Jiale', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Qu', 'firstname': 'Shiyuan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Junbiao', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Oo', 'firstname': 'Sanda', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, 27858, USA.\nElizabeth City State University, Elizabeth City, NC, 27909, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Baohong', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, 27858, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pan', 'firstname': 'Xiaoping', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, 27858, USA. panx@ecu.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Huawei', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China. bioche@nwsuaf.edu.cn.""}]"

33656286,Automated Laboratory Growth Assessment and Maintenance of Azotobacter vinelandii.,Current protocols,"Azotobacter vinelandii (A. vinelandii) is a commonly used model organism for the study of aerobic respiration, the bacterial production of several industrially relevant compounds, and, perhaps most significantly, the genetics and biochemistry of biological nitrogen fixation. Laboratory growth assessments of A. vinelandii are useful for evaluating the impact of environmental and genetic modifications on physiological properties, including diazotrophy. However, researchers typically rely on manual growth methods that are oftentimes laborious and inefficient. We present a protocol for the automated growth assessment of A. vinelandii on a microplate reader, particularly well-suited for studies of diazotrophic growth. We discuss common pitfalls and strategies for protocol optimization, and demonstrate the protocol's application toward growth evaluation of strains carrying modifications to nitrogen-fixation genes. © 2021 The Authors.

Subsequently, detection of the 16S rRNA gene fragment of A. phagocytophilum was attempted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in each blood sample. Our results confirmed the presence of specific antibodies in 85 out of 200 individuals (42.5%), but no significant changes were found between the animals of different ages and sexes. However, the PCR analysis did not detect any positive animals. Our data represent one of the highest values of seropositivity to A. phagocytophilum in horses in Central Europe.

33819743,"Molecular detection of Rickettsia raoultii, Rickettsia tamurae, and associated pathogens from ticks parasitizing water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus) in South Korea.",Ticks and tick-borne diseases,"Most defined Rickettsiales, which can be transmitted by ticks, are known to be important zoonotic pathogens. Some of these pathogens can cause severe diseases in humans, including anaplasmosis, rickettsioses, and ehrlichiosis. Previous studies in South Korea have investigated tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) residing in ticks found on grassy vegetation and animals. However, there is limited phylogenetic information on TBPs in ticks parasitizing Korean water deer (KWD; Hydropotes inermis argyropus). This study evaluated the prevalence, risk factors (regions, tick stages, and tick species), and coinfections of TBPs in ticks parasitizing KWD. Were collected a total of 283 hard ticks, including Haemaphysalis longicornis, Haemaphysalis flava, and Ixodes nipponensis from KWD in South Korea from 2013 to 2017. In 173 tested tick pools, genes for seven TBPs, namely Rickettsia raoultii (20 %), Rickettsia tamurae (1 %), Candidatus Rickettsia longicornii (31 %), Ehrlichia canis (3 %), Anaplasma capra (3 %), Anaplasma bovis (2 %), and Anaplasma sp.

Tick-borne anaplasmosis has been recognised as an emerging zoonotic health concern worldwide. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in ticks collected from dogs in the UK and map its distribution. Routine surveillance of tick-borne disease is essential as part of a ""One Health"" approach to infectious disease management.
Tick DNA samples collected in 2015 as part of a large-scale tick surveillance programme were analysed using a previously validated diagnostic quantitative PCR for A. phagocytophilum.
PCR analysis indicated that 138 out of 2994 tick DNA samples analysed were positive for A. phagocytophilum, a prevalence of 4.6% (95% CI: 3.89-5.42). Among these 138 tick DNA samples, 131 were from Ixodes ricinus, six were from Ixodes hexagonus and one was from Ixodes canisuga. Three of the I. ricinus tick DNA samples positive for A. phagocytophilum DNA were also positive for Borrelia spp. DNA and one was positive for Babesia spp. DNA, indicating co-infection. The ticks positive for the pathogen DNA were found widely distributed throughout the UK.

Subsequently, detection of the 16S rRNA gene fragment of A. phagocytophilum was attempted by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in each blood sample. Our results confirmed the presence of specific antibodies in 85 out of 200 individuals (42.5%), but no significant changes were found between the animals of different ages and sexes. However, the PCR analysis did not detect any positive animals. Our data represent one of the highest values of seropositivity to A. phagocytophilum in horses in Central Europe.

Post-transplant TB has varied pathogenesis with many approaches to its prevention, which is the most important way to reduce its incidence. Treatment of TB in organ recipients is challenging because of drug toxicity and interaction with immunosuppressants.
an 18-year-old woman that underwent kidney transplantation from a deceased donor and was discharged with fair renal function was readmitted at 37th postoperative day with fever. CT showed signs of miliary TB and fluid collection besides graft fistulization through the skin. The patient presented positive BAAR in the drained fluid and Koch's bacillus in the urine. She was treated with a four-drug regimen (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and etambutol), with great response and preserved graft function. We were informed that the recipient of the contralateral kidney also presented post-transplant TB, implying in a donor-derived origin.
TB is an important differential diagnosis for infectious complications in patients after solid-organ transplantation, especially in endemic regions.

Its spores can persist in soil and water for years and can also be aerosolized. A rapid, sensitive and specific method to detect B. anthracis is important for clinical management and preventing spread of anthrax. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is a rapid technique that amplifies target DNA in isothermal conditions with high sensitivity and specificity. In this study, a LAMP assay set targeting a chromosomal and two plasmid markers was developed. The individual assays of the LAMP set targeting pXO1 plasmid (lef), pXO2 plasmid (capB), and chromosome (BA5345) sequences could detect 10, 250, and 100 fg of genomic DNA and 10, 100, and 50 copies of the DNA targets harboured in recombinant plasmids, respectively.

The efficacy of the two-hydrocarbon degradation by the isolates bacterial was determined at a temperature of 25 °C and 37 °C and pH of 5.0 and 9.0. In inoculated media at 37 °C, Rhodococcus qinshengi fully metabolized naphthalene and degrade 56% of pyrene. Brevibacillus brevis break down over 80% of naphthalene at room temperatures (25 °C). However, it was found that P. mirabilis and R. qinshengi biodegraded nearly 94% of naphthalene in the incubated media. The capacity for pyrene and naphthalene degradation in varying pH and temperature conditions was shown to be significant in Rhodococcus qinshengi because of its mineralization exceeding 50% across the tested pH and temperature.

33830284,Genetic diversity and the presence of circular plasmids in Bacillus cereus isolates of clinical and environmental origin.,Archives of microbiology,"The diversity of 61 Bacillus cereus strains isolated from different clinical specimens, food including raw milk and milk products, and water was evaluated. PFGE analysis could discriminate 61 distinct pulsotypes with similarity levels from 25 to 82%, which were divided into 13 clonal complexes. The similarity between clonal complexes was at least 40%. Clinical strains were divided into 10 clonal complexes, while the strains, isolated from milk, food and water were included in 9, 6 and 6 clonal complexes, respectively. Three clonal complexes were dominated by clinical isolates, while they were absent in two complexes. Bacterial isolates from food, being a probable source of alimentary toxoinfection, showed low similarity to isolates from stool specimens. The isolates from both sources were classified together in only 4 out of 13 clonal complexes. The large circular and linear plasmids with the sizes between 50 and 200 kb were detected in 24 (39.3%) and 14 (23%) B. cereus strains, respectively. Thirteen (21.3%) strains contained only one plasmid, two plasmids were found in 6 (9.8%) of strains, and three or more plasmids were obtained in 5 (8.2%) of tested strains. The plasmids were confirmed in 30.8% and 40% of isolates from clinical specimens and food and milk samples, respectively. No clear correlation between the PFGE profiles, the source as well as plasmid content among all tested strains was observed.","10.1007/s00203-021-02302-w

33828147,Putative plasmid prophages of Bacillus cereus sensu lato may hold the key to undiscovered phage diversity.,Scientific reports,"Bacteriophages are bacterial viruses and the most abundant biological entities on Earth. Temperate bacteriophages can form prophages stably maintained in the host population: they either integrate into the host genome or replicate as plasmids in the host cytoplasm. As shown, tailed temperate bacteriophages may form circular plasmid prophages in many bacterial species of the taxa Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria and Spirochaetes. The actual number of such prophages is thought to be underestimated for two main reasons: first, in bacterial whole genome-sequencing assemblies, they are difficult to distinguish from actual plasmids; second, there is an absence of experimental studies which are vital to confirm their existence. In Firmicutes, such prophages appear to be especially numerous. In the present study, we identified 23 genomes from species of the Bacillus cereus group that were deposited in GenBank as plasmids and may belong to plasmid prophages with little or no homology to known viruses. We consider these putative prophages worth experimental assays since it will broaden our knowledge of phage diversity and suggest that more attention be paid to such molecules in all bacterial sequencing projects as this will help in identifying previously unknown phages.","10.1038/s41598-021-87111-3

33822096,Immune Response and Hemolymph Microbiota of Apis mellifera and Apis cerana After the Challenge With Recombinant Varroa Toxic Protein.,Journal of economic entomology,"The honey bee is a significant crop pollinator and key model insect for understanding social behavior, disease transmission, and development. The ectoparasitic Varroa destructor mite put threats on the honey bee industry. A Varroa toxic protein (VTP) from the saliva of Varroa mites contributes to the toxicity toward Apis cerana and the deformed wing virus elevation in Apis mellifera. However, the immune response and hemolymph microbiota of honey bee species after the injection of recombinant VTP has not yet been reported. In this study, both A. cerana and A. mellifera worker larvae were injected with the recombinant VTP. Then the expressions of the honey bee immune genes abaecin, defensin, and domeless at three time points were determined by qRT-PCR, and hemolymph microbial community were analyzed by culture-dependent method, after recombinant VTP injection. The mortality rates of A. cerana larvae were much higher than those of A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. VTP injection induced the upregulation of defensin gene expression in A. mellifera larvae, and higher levels of abaecin and domeless mRNAs response in A. cerana larvae, compared with the control (without any injection). Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injection also upregulated the expression levels of abaecin, defensin, and domeless in A. mellifera and A. cerana larvae. Three bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus cohnii, and Bacillus cereus) were isolated from the hemolymph of A. cerana larvae after VTP injection and at 48 h after PBS injections. Two bacterial species (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. No bacterial colonies were detected from the larval hemolymph of both honey bee species treated by injection only and the control. The result indicates that abaecin, defensin, and domeless genes and hemolymph microbiota respond to the VTP challenge. VTP injection might induce the dramatic growth of different bacterial species in the hemolymph of the injected larvae of A. mellifera and A. cerana, which provide cues for further studying the interactions among the honey bee, VTP, and hemolymph bacteria.",10.1093/jee/toab047,"[{'lastname': 'Balakrishnan', 'firstname': 'Balachandar', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Hua', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Wenfeng', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Richou', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}]"

33462721,Evaluation of biosurfactant production potential of Lysinibacillus fusiformis MK559526 isolated from automobile-mechanic-workshop soil.,Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society for Microbiology],"Biosurfactants are amphipathic biological compounds with surface active potential and are produced by many microorganisms. Biosurfactant production by Lysinibacillus fusiformis MK559526 isolated from automobile-mechanic-shop soil was investigated with a view to assessing its potential for production and potential for optimization.
Effects of carbon and nitrogen sources, pH, temperature and incubation periods on biosurfactant production were evaluated with a view to optimizing the processes. Fourier Transform Infra-Red absorption peaks and Gas chromatography mass spectrometry were used to determine the functional groups of the chemical make-up and the chemical profile of the biosurfactant respectively.
Lysinibacillus fusiformis surfactant had emulsification index of 65.15 ± 0.35 %, oil displacement of 2.7 ± 0.26 mm, zone of haemolysis of 7.3 ± 0.16 mm and a positive drop collapse test. Optimized culture conditions for biosurfactant production: temperature, 35 ºC; pH, 7.0; starch solution, 40 g/L and urea, 1.5 g/L showed a reduction in surface tension to 28.46 ± 1.11 mN/m and increased emulsification index to 93.80 ± 0.41 %. Maximum biosurfactant production of 2.92 ± 0.04 g/L was obtained after 72 h. The biosurfactant contained peptides and fatty acids. The predominant fatty acid was 9-Octadecenoic acid (80.80%).
The above results showing high emulsification potential and remarkable reduction in the surface tension are good biosurfactant attributes. Consequently, Lysinibacillus fusiformis MK559526 is a good candidate for biosurfactant production.","10.1007/s42770-021-00432-3

33340794,"Characterization of Lysinibacillus fusiformis strain S4C11: In vitro, in planta, and in silico analyses reveal a plant-beneficial microbe.",Microbiological research,"Despite sharing many of the traits that have allowed the genus Bacillus to gain recognition for its agricultural relevance, the genus Lysinibacillus is not as well-known and studied. The present study employs in vitro, in vivo, in planta, and in silico approaches to characterize Lysinibacillus fusiformis strain S4C11, isolated from the roots of an apple tree in northern Italy. The in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that strain S4C11 possesses an antifungal activity against different fungal pathogens, and is capable of interfering with the germination of Botrytis cinerea conidia, as well as of inhibiting its growth through the production of volatile organic molecules. In planta assays showed that the strain possesses the ability to promote plant growth, that is not host-specific, both in controlled conditions and in a commercial nursery. Biocontrol assays carried out against phytopathogenic viruses gave contrasting results, suggesting that the strain does not activate the host's defense pathways. The in silico analyses were carried out by sequencing the genome of the strain through an innovative approach that combines Illumina and High-Definition Mapping methods, allowing the reconstruction of a main chromosome and two plasmids from strain S4C11. The analysis of the genes encoded by the genome contributed to the characterization of the strain, detecting genes related to the biocontrol effect detected in the experimental trials.",10.1016/j.micres.2020.126665,"[{'lastname': 'Passera', 'firstname': 'Alessandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences - Production, Landscape, Agroenergy, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.

33818654,Isolation and screening of potassium solubilizing bacteria from saxicolous habitat and their impact on tomato growth in different soil types.,Archives of microbiology,"Bacteria that solubilize nutrients in the soil are commonly used as bio-inoculants for promoting the growth of different crop species. However, the influence of potassium (K) solubilizing bacteria (KSB) originating from saxicolous habitat (rock-dwelling) on plant growth has not been frequently examined. In this study, we isolated KSB from saxicolous habitats and estimated their ability to produce plant growth hormone, organic acids, and siderophore that may facilitate plant growth. Fifteen culturable saxicolous bacterial isolates with varied K solubilizing ability were isolated from two sites. Of these, four potential K solubilizers were selected and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The four bacterial isolates resembled Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, and Burkholderia cenocepacia and produced different organic acids, indole acetic acid, and siderophore under in vitro conditions. Potassium solubilization differed among the bacterial isolates and was significantly influenced by K sources. Inoculation of KSB improved the tomato plant growth parameters like plant height, leaf area, total root length, root/shoot ratio, and tissue K content in sterilized and unsterilized Alfisol, and Vertisol soils under greenhouse conditions. We also observed higher residual K content in the KSB inoculated post-harvest soils. Among the four KSB isolates screened, B. licheniformis and B. cenocepacia presents an excellent prospect as bio-inoculants for improving tomato growth in different soil types. Besides these, the enriched K content in the post-harvest soils may help the growth of subsequent crops in sustainable agriculture.","10.1007/s00203-021-02284-9

33686628,Application of Dual Promoter Expression System for the Enhanced Heparosan Production in Bacillus megaterium.,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,"Heparosan, a capsular polysaccharide synthesized by certain pathogenic bacteria, is a promising precursor for heparin production. Heparosan production is catalyzed by the formation of KfiC-KfiA complex and the subsequent action of KfiC and KfiA proteins. Polycistronic expression of kfiC and kfiA in Bacillus megaterium yielded an unbalanced expression of KfiC and KfiA proteins resulted in decreased heparosan production. In this study, dual promoter plasmid system was constructed to increase the expression levels of KfiC and KfiA proteins. Dual promoter plasmid system along with UDP-glucuronic acid pathway overexpression (CADuet-DB) increased the heparosan production to 203 mg/L in shake flask experiments. Batch fermentation of strain CADuet-DB under controlled conditions yielded a maximum heparosan concentration of 627 mg/L, which is 59% higher than strain CA-DB. A modified logistic model is applied to describe the kinetics of heparosan production and biomass growth. Fed batch fermentation resulted in 3-fold enhancement in heparosan concentration (1.96 g/L), compared to batch fermentation. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that heparosan from strain CADuet-DB was similar to Escherichia coli K5 heparosan. These results suggested that dual promoter expression system is a promising alternative to polycistronic expression system to produce heparosan in B. megaterium.","10.1007/s12010-021-03541-9

This was a cross-sectional study of 60 self-reported medically healthy blood donors aged over 50 years. According to standard procedures, whole blood was separated by fractionation into plasma, buffy-coat, and red blood cell (RBC)-fractions. The buffy-coat was screened for bacterial contamination using BacT/ALERT. Samples from plasma and RBC-fractions were incubated anaerobically and aerobically at 37 °C for 7 days on trypticase soy blood agar (TSA). For identification, colony polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers targeting 16S rDNA.
From 62% of the donors with periodontitis, bacterial growth was observed on at least 1 out of 4 plates inoculated with plasma or RBCs, whereas only 13% of plates inoculated with plasma or RBCs from periodontally healthy controls yielded bacterial growth (relative risk 6.4, 95% CI: 2.1; 19.5; p=0.0011). None of the donors tested positive for bacterial contamination using BacT/ALERT. Cutibacterium acnes was found in 31% of the donations from donors with periodontitis and in 10% of the donations from periodontally healthy donors. In addition, Staphylococcus species, Bacillus mycoides, Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, and Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii were detected.
Periodontitis increased the risk of bacterial contamination of blood products. Contaminating bacteria are often associated with the RBC-fraction. As the BacT/ALERT test is generally performed on platelet products, routine screening fails to detect many occurrences of viable bacteria in the RBC-fraction.",10.2450/2021.0336-20,"[{'lastname': 'Damgaard', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Section of Periodontology, Department of Odontology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nInstitute for Inf lammation Research, Centre for Rheumatology and Spine Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Sækmose', 'firstname': 'Susanne G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Region Zealand Blood Bank, Zealand University Hospital, Næstved and Roskilde, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Nilsson', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Costerton Biofilm Centre, Department of International Health, Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Kilian', 'firstname': 'Mogens', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Nielsen', 'firstname': 'Claus H', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Section of Periodontology, Department of Odontology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nInstitute for Inf lammation Research, Centre for Rheumatology and Spine Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Holmstrup', 'firstname': 'Palle', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Section of Periodontology, Department of Odontology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}]"

33806789,Vaccine Efficacy of Self-Assembled Multimeric Protein Scaffold Particles Displaying the Glycoprotein Gn Head Domain of Rift Valley Fever Virus.,Vaccines,"Compared to free antigens, antigens immobilized on scaffolds, such as nanoparticles, generally show improved immunogenicity. Conventionally, antigens are conjugated to scaffolds through genetic fusion or chemical conjugation, which may result in impaired assembly or heterogeneous binding and orientation of the antigens. By combining two emerging technologies-i.e., self-assembling multimeric protein scaffold particles (MPSPs) and bacterial superglue-these shortcomings can be overcome and antigens can be bound on particles in their native conformation. In the present work, we assessed whether this technology could improve the immunogenicity of a candidate subunit vaccine against the zoonotic Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). For this, the head domain of glycoprotein Gn, a known target of neutralizing antibodies, was coupled on various MPSPs to further assess immunogenicity and efficacy in vivo. The results showed that the Gn head domain, when bound to the lumazine synthase-based MPSP, reduced mortality in a lethal mouse model and protected lambs, the most susceptible RVFV target animals, from viremia and clinical signs after immunization.

33824496,Bacillus subtilis biofilm formation and social interactions.,Nature reviews. Microbiology,"Biofilm formation is a process in which microbial cells aggregate to form collectives that are embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix. Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive bacterium that is used to dissect the mechanisms controlling matrix production and the subsequent transition from a motile planktonic cell state to a sessile biofilm state. The collective nature of life in a biofilm allows emergent properties to manifest, and B. subtilis biofilms are linked with novel industrial uses as well as probiotic and biocontrol processes. In this Review, we outline the molecular details of the biofilm matrix and the regulatory pathways and external factors that control its production. We explore the beneficial outcomes associated with biofilms. Finally, we highlight major advances in our understanding of concepts of microbial evolution and community behaviour that have resulted from studies of the innate heterogeneity of biofilms.","10.1038/s41579-021-00540-9

33836012,Comprehensive profiling of the gut microbiota in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of varying severity.,PloS one,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease that reduces lung and respiratory function, with a high mortality rate. Severe and acute deterioration of COPD can easily lead to respiratory failure, resulting in personal, social, and medical burden. Recent studies have shown a high correlation between the gut microbiota and lung inflammation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between gut microbiota and COPD severity. A total of 60 COPD patients with varying severity according to GOLD guidelines were enrolled in this study. DNA was extracted from patients' stool and 16S rRNA data analysis conducted using high-throughput sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis. The richness of the gut microbiota was not associated with COPD severity. The gut microbiome is more similar in stage 1 and 2 COPD than stage 3+4 COPD. Fusobacterium and Aerococcus were more abundant in stage 3+4 COPD. Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group and Lachnoclostridium were less abundant in stage 2-4, and Tyzzerella 4 and Dialister were less abundant in stage 1. However, the abundance of a Bacteroides was associated with blood eosinophils and lung function. This study suggests that no distinctive gut microbiota pattern is associated with the severity of COPD. The gut microbiome could affect COPD by gut inflammation shaping the host immune system.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249944,"[{'lastname': 'Chiu', 'firstname': 'Yu-Chi', 'initials': 'YC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nInstitute of Hospital & Health Care Administration, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Shih-Wei', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Chi-Wei', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Rebecca Chou-Jui', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Yung-Chia', 'initials': 'YC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lan', 'firstname': 'Tzuo-Yun', 'initials': 'TY', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Hospital & Health Care Administration, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Lawrence Shih-Hsin', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}]"

Attaining a better understanding of the development of the rumen microbial community at different weaning stages can aid the identification of the optimal weaning age. We investigated the effects of weaning age on ruminal bacterial and archaeal communities in Hu lambs. Thirty male Hu lambs were randomly assigned to two weaning-age groups: a group weaned at 30 days of age (W30) and a group weaned at 45 days of age (W45), with each group having five replicate pens. On the weaning day (day 30 for W30 and day 45 for W45) and at 5 days postweaning [day 35 for W30 (PW30) and day 50 for W45 (PW45)], one lamb from each replicate was randomly selected and sacrificed.

33832437,Association between aging-dependent gut microbiome dysbiosis and dry eye severity in C57BL/6 male mouse model: a pilot study.,BMC microbiology,"While aging is a potent risk factor of dry eye disease, age-related gut dysbiosis is associated with inflammation and chronic geriatric diseases. Emerging evidence have demonstrated that gut dysbiosis contributes to the pathophysiology or exacerbation of ocular diseases including dry eye disease. However, the relationship between aging-related changes in gut microbiota and dry eye disease has not been elucidated. In this pilot study, we investigated the association between aging-dependent microbiome changes and dry eye severity in C57BL/6 male mice.
Eight-week-old (8 W, n = 15), one-year-old (1Y, n = 10), and two-year-old (2Y, n = 8) C57BL/6 male mice were used. Dry eye severity was assessed by corneal staining scores and tear secretion. Bacterial genomic 16 s rRNA from feces was analyzed. Main outcomes were microbiome compositional differences among the groups and their correlation to dry eye severity. In aged mice (1Y and 2Y), corneal staining increased and tear secretion decreased with statistical significance. Gut microbiome α-diversity was not different among the groups. However, β-diversity was significantly different among the groups. In univariate analysis, phylum Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and genus Alistipes, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Paraprevotella, and Helicobacter were significantly related to dry eye severity. After adjustment of age, multivariate analysis revealed phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and genus Lactobacillus, Alistipes, Prevotella, Paraprevotella, and Helicobacter to be significantly associated with dry eye severity.
Our pilot study suggests that aging-dependent changes in microbiome composition are related to severity of dry eye signs in C57BL/6 male mice.","10.1186/s12866-021-02173-7

33826105,Pharmacokinetics of Levornidazole Tablet in Healthy Chinese Subjects and Proposed Dosing Regimen Based on Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis.,Infectious diseases and therapy,"Levornidazole is a novel nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes. We aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of levornidazole after single and multiple oral doses of levornidazole tablets in healthy Chinese subjects and propose the dosing regimen based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis.
A single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with a single ascending dose (250, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg) and multiple doses of 500 mg levornidazole q12h for 7 days. Food effect on PK and absolute bioavailability were investigated at the 500 mg dose level. Blood and urine samples were collected to determine the PK parameters of levornidazole. The probability of target attainment (PTA) and cumulative fraction of response (CFR) were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation to predict the clinical efficacy of levornidazole tablets.
Plasma concentration reached peak about 0.5 h after single dose (250-1500 mg) of levornidazole tablets. The maximal concentration (C
Levornidazole tablets are absorbed rapidly and completely and distributed extensively with a long half-life and low urinary excretion after a single dose or multiple doses in healthy Chinese subjects. Levornidazole tablets can be taken with or without food. Levornidazole tablets 500 mg q12h and 750 mg q24h are expected to achieve the desired efficacy in B. fragilis infections.

33815329,Specific Microbial Taxa and Functional Capacity Contribute to Chicken Abdominal Fat Deposition.,Frontiers in microbiology,"Genetically selected chickens with better growth and early maturation show an incidental increase in abdominal fat deposition (AFD). Accumulating evidence reveals a strong association between gut microbiota and adiposity. However, studies focusing on the role of gut microbiota in chicken obesity in conventional breeds are limited. Therefore, 400 random broilers with different levels of AFD were used to investigate the gut microbial taxa related to AFD by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 76 representative samples, and to identify the specific microbial taxa contributing to fat-related metabolism using shotgun metagenomic analyses of eight high and low AFD chickens. The results demonstrated that the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota decrease as the accumulation of chicken abdominal fat increases. The decrease of Bacteroidetes and the increase of Firmicutes were correlated with the accumulation of chicken AFD.

33813129,Development of a EUCAST disk diffusion method for the susceptibility testing of rapidly growing anaerobic bacteria using Fastidious Anaerobe Agar (FAA) - Development study using Bacteroides species.,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,"Antimicrobial resistance among anaerobic bacteria is increasing, leading to a growing demand for inexpensive and reliable susceptibility testing methods. The aim of this study was to determine the suitability of Fastidious Anaerobe Agar (FAA) as a medium for disk diffusion of rapidly growing anaerobic bacteria.
Reproducibility of zone diameters and quality of growth were tested using six quality control (QC) strains. We compared four anaerobic incubation systems, two incubation temperatures (35 and 37°C) and FAA from four manufacturers. The effect of incubation for 16-20 hours instead of 24 hours was tested on 10 randomly selected Bacteroides fragilis-group isolates. The final method was tested on 170 clinical B. fragilis-group isolates- and compared to agar dilution MICs.
After 24 hours incubation all QC strains demonstrated confluent growth. The different anaerobic incubation systems were equal regarding quality of growth and zone diameters. Incubation at 35°C resulted in slightly larger zones (1-2 mm) compared to 37°C. Except for Acumedia FAA, the different manufacturers showed good agreement in zone diameters. All B. fragilis-group isolates displayed confluent growth after 16-20 hours. Metronidazole inhibition zones correlated well with the reference MICs. There was an area of poorer separation for meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam between 19-27 and 14-23 mm respectively. Prolonged incubation (40-44 h) of clindamycin resulted in better separation and the area of overlap was reduced from 13 to 8 mm compared with 16-20 hours incubation.
FAA is a suitable medium for disk diffusion of this collection of rapidly growing anaerobic bacteria.",10.1016/j.cmi.2021.03.028,"[{'lastname': 'Bavelaar', 'firstname': 'Herjan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

33780104,The presence of P. melaninogenica within tissue and preliminary study on its role in the pathogenesis of oral lichen planus.,Oral diseases,"Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic inflammatory disease that occurs in the oral mucosa with characteristic white striations lesions, recurrent erosions and pains. The etiology and pathogenesis of OLP are still unclear.
We analyzed the bacterial community structure of buccal mucosa in patients with OLP and normal controls by high-throughput sequencing. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was uesd to detect Prevotella melaninogenica (P. melaninogenica) in 13 OLP samples and 10 controls. The amounts of P. melaninogenica in OLP buccal mucosa and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in co-culture of mouse-derived macrophages with P. melaninogenica were detected by RT-qPCR.
The P. melaninogenica was more abundant in OLP than in healthy controls and the differences were significant at the level of the phylum, family, genus and species (P<0.05). FISH showed that P. melaninogenica can invade the epithelium and even the lamina propria of OLP, while no invasion was found in the normal mucosa. P. melaninogenica can adhere to and invade macrophages and then activate the transcription of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in NF-κB signaling pathway.
P. melaninogenica may be involved in the pathogenic process of OLP, and its specific mechanism deserves further study.",10.1111/odi.13862,"[{'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Sai-Wei', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Pan', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Li-Ting', 'initials': 'LT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of life Sciences and technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Zheng-Wu', 'initials': 'ZW', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Yi-Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Rui-Xin', 'initials': 'RX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of life Sciences and technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Yuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}]"
33718263,Dynamic Alterations of Oral Microbiota Related to Halitosis in Preschool Children.,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,"This longitudinal study was aimed to evaluate the dynamic shift in oral microbiota during the process of halitosis progression among preschool children.
The oral examinations, questionnaires and tongue coating specimens were collected at the baseline and 12-month follow-up. All children were oral healthy at the enrollment. At the 12-month follow-up, children who developed halitosis were included to the halitosis group (n = 10). While children who matched the age, gender, kindergarten and without halitosis were included to the control group (n = 10). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to reveal the shift of the tongue coating microbiome in these children during the 12- month period with the Human Oral Microbiome Database.
A remarkable shift in relative abundance of specific bacteria was observed prior to halitosis development. The principal coordinates and alpha diversity analyses revealed different shifting patterns of halitosis and the healthy participants' microbiome structures and bacterial diversity over the 12-month follow-up. Both groups showed variable microbiota community structures before the onset of halitosis. Halitosis-enriched species 
The microbiome composition and relative abundance of the tongue coatings in the halitosis and control groups remarkably differed, even prior to the onset of the clinical manifestations of halitosis. The halitosis prediction model constructed on the basis of tongue coating microbiome biomarkers indicated the microbial shifts before the halitosis onset. Therefore, this can be considered for the timely detection and intervention of halitosis in children.",10.3389/fcimb.2021.599467,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Preventive Dentistry, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai, China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology and Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Ce', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Preventive Dentistry, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai, China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology and Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Guizhi', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Department of Preventive Dentistry, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai, China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology and Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhan', 'firstname': 'Jingyu', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Preventive Dentistry, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai, China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology and Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Xiping', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Preventive Dentistry, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai, China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology and Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Xi', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Preventive Dentistry, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai, China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology and Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}]"
33604753,Characterization of microbiota in acute leukemia patients following successful remission induction chemotherapy without antimicrobial prophylaxis.,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,"In the present study, we characterized the microbiomes of acute leukemia (AL) patients who achieved complete remission following remission induction chemotherapy (RIC) as outpatients, but who did not receive antimicrobials to treat or prevent febrile neutropenia.
Saliva and stool samples from 9 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 11 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 5 healthy controls were subjected to 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing at baseline and at 3 months following RIC. Only patients who achieved remission at 3 months post-treatment were included. We excluded anyone who used antimicrobials within 2 months of enrollment or at any time during the study period.
At baseline, the relative abundances of species of Prevotella maculosa (P=0.001), Megasphaera micronuciformis (P=0.014), Roseburia inulinivorans (P=0.021), and Bacteroides uniformis (P=0.004) in saliva and Prevotella copri (P=0.002) in the stools of controls were significantly higher than in AL patients. Following RIC, the relative abundances of Eubacterium sp. oral clone DO008 (P=0.012), Leptotrichia sp. oral clone IK040 (P=0.002), Oribacterium sp. oral taxon 108 (P=0.029), Megasphaera micronuciformis (P=0.016), TM7 phylum sp. oral clone DR034 (P<0.001), Roseburia inulinivorans (P=0.034), Actinomyces odontolyticus (P=0.014), Leptotrichia buccalis (P=0.005), and Prevotella melaninogenica (P=0.046) in saliva and Lactobacillus fermentum (P=0.046), Coprococcus catus (P=0.050), butyrate-producing bacterium SS3/4 (P=0.013), and Bacteroides coprocola (P=0.027) in the stools of AL patients were significantly greater than in controls.
Following RIC, several taxa are changed in stool and salvia samples of AL patients. Our results warrant future large-scale multicenter studies to examine whether the microbiota might have an effect on clinical outcomes of AL patients.","10.1007/s10123-021-00163-3

33536555,Structural changes in the oral microbiome of the adolescent patients with moderate or severe dental fluorosis.,Scientific reports,"Dental fluorosis is a very prevalent endemic disease. Although oral microbiome has been reported to correlate with different oral diseases, there appears to be an absence of research recognizing any relationship between the severity of dental fluorosis and the oral microbiome. To this end, we investigated the changes in oral microbial community structure and identified bacterial species associated with moderate and severe dental fluorosis. Salivary samples of 42 individuals, assigned into Healthy (N = 9), Mild (N = 14) and Moderate/Severe (M&S, N = 19), were investigated using the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. The oral microbial community structure based on Bray Curtis and Weighted Unifrac were significantly changed in the M&S group compared with both of Healthy and Mild. As the predominant phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes showed variation in the relative abundance among groups. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio was significantly higher in the M&S group. LEfSe analysis was used to identify differentially represented taxa at the species level. Several genera such as Streptococcus mitis, Gemella parahaemolysans, Lactococcus lactis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were significantly more abundant in patients with moderate/severe dental fluorosis, while Prevotella melaninogenica and Schaalia odontolytica were enriched in the Healthy group. In conclusion, our study indicates oral microbiome shift in patients with moderate/severe dental fluorosis. We identified several differentially represented bacterial species enriched in moderate and severe fluorosis. Findings from this study suggests that the roles of these bacteria in oral health and related diseases warrant more consideration in patients with moderate and severe fluorosis.",10.1038/s41598-021-82709-z,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Qian', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Special Key Laboratory of Oral Disease Research, Life Sciences Institute, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.\nSpecial Key Laboratory of Microbial Resources and Drug Development, Life Sciences Institute, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Xuelan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Special Key Laboratory of Oral Disease Research, Life Sciences Institute, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.\nSchool of Stomatology, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Huan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Special Key Laboratory of Microbial Resources and Drug Development, Life Sciences Institute, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wei', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyuan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, Division of Agriculture, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiaofan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, Division of Agriculture, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Zehui', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'School of Stomatology, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Rui', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Stomatology, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Qian', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'School of Stomatology, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Jiangchao', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, Division of Agriculture, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA. jzhao77@uark.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Jianguo', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Special Key Laboratory of Oral Disease Research, Life Sciences Institute, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China. jgl_zmu@126.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Deng', 'firstname': 'Feilong', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Special Key Laboratory of Oral Disease Research, Life Sciences Institute, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China. fdeng@uark.edu.\nSpecial Key Laboratory of Microbial Resources and Drug Development, Life Sciences Institute, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China. fdeng@uark.edu.\nDepartment of Animal Science, Division of Agriculture, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, USA. fdeng@uark.edu.'}]"

The Tygerberg Endocarditis Cohort (TEC) study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of patients with confirmed or suspected IE presenting to Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Current analysis includes patients that presented between November 2019 and August 2020. Forty four (44) patients have been included in this ongoing study. Fourteen of the 44 patients (31.8%) had BCNE. Further analysis of the patients with BCNE identified Bartonella species as the most common causative organism (n=6; 43%). Other causes included Mycoplasma species (n=2). No cause could be identified in 4 of the 44 patients (9%). Bartonella quintana was identified with PCR of valvular tissue as the causative organism in 4 of the 5 patients that underwent urgent surgery. The patients with Bartonella IE (n=6) had an average age of 39 years with equal gender distribution. The common clinical features were clubbing (n=5; 83%), anemia (n=4; 66.6%), haematuria (n=3; 50%), acute on chronic severe regurgitant lesion (n=3; 50%) and acute severe regurgitant lesion (n=2; 33.3%).The aortic valve was involved in 5 of 6 patients. During a mean follow-up period of 251 days after diagnosis, no major adverse events occurred. Bartonella-associated IE is an important cause of BCNE in the Western Cape of South Africa. Imaging findings (in patients with BCNE) of significant valvular destruction with large vegetations on the aortic valve not affected by congenital or rheumatic valve disease should raise the suspicion of Bartonella-associated IE.","10.1007/s10096-021-04239-w

33811771,A clinical review and history of pubic lice.,Clinical and experimental dermatology,"The ectoparasite, Pthirus pubis (PtP), (crab or pubic louse) has plagued primates from pre-historic apes to Homo sapiens. We combed the literature from antiquity to present day using Medline and EMBASE, reviewing the pubic louse's origins, its evolution with mankind, presentation and management. Medline and EMBASE provided the greatest yield of literature compared to other databases. PtP incidence estimates range from 0.3-4.6% and prevalence around 2% in adults. War, disasters and overcrowding support lice transmission, but modern pubic hair grooming has reduced PtP in recent years. PtP, is usually found on pubic hair, but may infest scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes and body hair. Reports suggest the possibility of PtP as a vector for Bartonella spp. and Acinetobacter spp., requiring further studies. Transmission is via close contact, so sexual abuse and concomitant STIs should be considered. Symptoms and signs include: pruritus, red papules and rust/brown deposits from feeding or faecal matter. Visualisation of live lice confirms diagnosis. Long-standing treatments include hand-picking and combing, but in modern times pediculicidal products may generate faster resolution. Permethrin or pyrethrins are first-line recommendations. Resistance to pediculicides is common with head lice and is presumed likely in PtP although data are lacking. Pseudo-resistance occurs due to poor compliance, incorrect or ineffective dosing and reinfestation. In true resistance, a different pediculicide class should be used e.g., second-line agents: phenothrin, malathion or ivermectin. Lice have existed long before humans and given their adaptability, despite habitat challenges from fashion trends in body hair-removal, are likely to continue to survive.",10.1111/ced.14666,"[{'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'P U', 'initials': 'PU', 'affiliation': 'Norfolk and Norwich University Trust Hospital.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Genitourinary Medicine Department: iCASH Norwich, Cambridge community services NHS trust.'}, {'lastname': 'Levell', 'firstname': 'N J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': 'Norfolk and Norwich University Trust Hospital.'}]"

The Tygerberg Endocarditis Cohort (TEC) study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of patients with confirmed or suspected IE presenting to Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Current analysis includes patients that presented between November 2019 and August 2020. Forty four (44) patients have been included in this ongoing study. Fourteen of the 44 patients (31.8%) had BCNE. Further analysis of the patients with BCNE identified Bartonella species as the most common causative organism (n=6; 43%). Other causes included Mycoplasma species (n=2). No cause could be identified in 4 of the 44 patients (9%). Bartonella quintana was identified with PCR of valvular tissue as the causative organism in 4 of the 5 patients that underwent urgent surgery. The patients with Bartonella IE (n=6) had an average age of 39 years with equal gender distribution. The common clinical features were clubbing (n=5; 83%), anemia (n=4; 66.6%), haematuria (n=3; 50%), acute on chronic severe regurgitant lesion (n=3; 50%) and acute severe regurgitant lesion (n=2; 33.3%).The aortic valve was involved in 5 of 6 patients. During a mean follow-up period of 251 days after diagnosis, no major adverse events occurred. Bartonella-associated IE is an important cause of BCNE in the Western Cape of South Africa. Imaging findings (in patients with BCNE) of significant valvular destruction with large vegetations on the aortic valve not affected by congenital or rheumatic valve disease should raise the suspicion of Bartonella-associated IE.","10.1007/s10096-021-04239-w

33797675,Clinical profile and visual outcome of intraocular inflammation associated with cat-scratch disease in Japanese patients.,Japanese journal of ophthalmology,"To evaluate intraocular inflammation in Japanese patients with cat-scratch disease (CSD).
Retrospective clinical chart review.
The cases of 15 consecutive patients (19 affected eyes) in Kochi Prefecture, Japan who were serologically positive for Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana infection in association with intraocular inflammation were reviewed. The clinical manifestations, ocular complications, and treatment modalities were recorded. The clinical charts and photographic records were also reviewed for evidence of optic disc lesions, macular star, foci of chorioretinitis, and other findings.
Thirteen patients reported fever before or at the time of the initial presentation. Ten of 11 patients with decreased visual acuity manifested neuroretinitis, and the remaining patient showed retinochoroiditis with macular involvement. One patient with a visual field defect manifested branch retinal artery occlusion. Three patients without visual disturbance presented with fever of unknown cause. Discrete white retinal or retinochoroidal lesions were the most common findings (84% of eyes, 87% of patients), followed by retinal hemorrhage (63% of eyes, 80% of patients), optic disc lesions (63% of eyes, 73% of patients), serous retinal detachment (53% of eyes, 67% of patients), and macular star (47% of eyes, 60% of patients).
White retinal or retinochoroidal foci were the most common ocular posterior segment manifestations of CSD in this patient population. A diagnosis of CSD should be suspected in patients with fever and chorioretinal white spots, and the absence of neuroretinitis or macular star does not exclude the possibility of intraocular inflammation in CSD.","10.1007/s10384-021-00835-7

33609646,Human dental pulp stem cells: A sanctuary for relapsing Bartonella quintana.,Microbial pathogenesis,"Bartonella quintana is a facultative intracellular bacterium responsible for relapsing fever, an example of non-sterilizing immunity. The cellular sanctuary of B. quintana in-between febrile relapses remains unknown but repeated detection of B. quintana in dental pulp specimens suggested long-term half-life dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) as candidates. As the capacity of DPSCs to internalize microscopic particles was unknown, we confirmed that DPSCs internalized B. quintana bacteria: Gimenez staining and fluorescence microscopy localized B. quintana bacteria inside DPSCs and this internalization did not affect the cellular multiplication of DPSCs during a one-month follow-up despite the increase in the bacterial load. B. quintana-infected DPSCs did not produce Tumor Necrosis Factor-α whereas an important production of Monocytes Chemoattractant Protein-1 was observed. These unprecedented observations suggest the possibility that DPSCs are shelters for the long-term persistence of B. quintana in the host, warranting further experimental and clinical investigations.",10.1016/j.micpath.2021.104797,"[{'lastname': 'Oumarou Hama', 'firstname': 'Hamadou', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamada', 'firstname': 'Attoumani', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Aboudharam', 'firstname': 'Gérard', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; UFR Odontologie, Aix-Marseille-Université, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghigo', 'firstname': 'Éric', 'initials': 'É', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, SSA, VITROME, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Drancourt', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.

33789161,Lipid binding by the N-terminal motif mediates plasma membrane localization of Bordetella effector protein BteA.,The Journal of biological chemistry,"The respiratory pathogens Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica employ a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject a 69-kDa BteA effector protein into host cells. This effector is known to contain two functional domains, including an N-terminal lipid raft-targeting (LRT) domain, and a cytotoxic C-terminal domain that induces non-apoptotic and caspase-1-independent host cell death. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of BteA with plasma membrane as well as its cytotoxic activity in the course of Bordetella infections remain poorly understood. Using a protein-lipid overlay assay and surface plasmon resonance, we show here that the recombinant LRT domain binds negatively-charged membrane phospholipids. Specifically, we determined that the dissociation constants of the LRT domain binding liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidic acid (PA), and phosphatidylserine (PS) were ∼450 nM, ∼490 nM, and ∼1.2 μM, respectively. Both PS and PIP2 were required to target the LRT domain and/or full-length BteA to the plasma membrane of yeast cells. The membrane association further involved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of LRT, and depended on a leucine residue in the L1 loop between the first two helices of the four-helix bundle. Importantly, charge-reversal substitutions within the L1 region disrupted plasma membrane localization of the BteA effector without hampering its cytotoxic activity during B. bronchiseptica infection of HeLa cells. The LRT-mediated targeting of BteA to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane of host cells is, therefore, dispensable for effector cytotoxicity.",10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100607,"[{'lastname': 'Malcova', 'firstname': 'Ivana', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Bumba', 'firstname': 'Ladislav', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Uljanic', 'firstname': 'Filip', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuzmenko', 'firstname': 'Darya', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Nedomova', 'firstname': 'Jana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamanova', 'firstname': 'Jana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.

Bronchopneumonia caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb) is common but the associated increase in CRP concentration in naturally infected dogs has not been fully explored.
To compare CRP concentrations of dogs with Bb infection, with or without radiographic pulmonary lesions, to dogs with aspiration bronchopneumonia (ABP).
Sixteen dogs with Bb infection and 36 dogs with ABP.
Retrospective study. C-reactive protein concentrations and thoracic radiographs were available for each dog.
Eleven dogs with Bb infection had alveolar lesions. In all dogs, CRP concentration was mildly increased (14-38 mg/L). In the 5 dogs without alveolar lesions, CRP concentration was within the reference range in all but 1 dog, in which it was slightly increased. Median CRP concentration was significantly higher in dogs with alveolar lesions (20 mg/L) compared with dogs without alveolar lesions (5 mg/L; p < .002). In dogs with Bb infection, median duration of clinical signs was not different between dogs with normal CRP concentration and dogs with increased concentration. In dogs with Bb infection either with or without alveolar lessions, median CRP concentration was significantly lower (20 mg/L) than in dogs with ABP (118 mg/L; p < .001).

33645738,A proposed scheme for the monitoring of antibiotic resistance in veterinary pathogens of food animals in the UK.,The Veterinary record,"Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a global threat to both animal and public health, and detecting its occurrence is an important component of control strategies. Monitoring programmes for antibiotic resistance are currently in place in food-producing animals in the European Union covering the zoonotic bacteria Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni and the indicator bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. However, there is no equivalent pan-European statutory monitoring programme covering the antibiotic susceptibility of veterinary bacterial pathogens in food animals. This paper considers that issue and aims to facilitate and stimulate further discussion.
Recommendations, proposed by the authors from the scientific literature and following expert discussion at international meetings, are presented for monitoring the susceptibility of key veterinary pathogens.
The selected veterinary pathogens comprise Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, E. coli, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus spp. from the major food animal species cattle, pigs and poultry. The organisms are tested using harmonised panels of antibiotics over specified dilution ranges in a broth microdilution method.
The selected antibiotics and their respective dilution ranges are presented together with the underlying rationale for inclusion; the ranges chosen are suitable for incorporation into three microtitre plates, with each organism tested using a single plate. The recommendations are being implemented in 2020 in the UK for monitoring of the susceptibility of veterinary bacterial pathogens.",10.1002/vetr.201,"[{'lastname': 'Teale', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Animal and Plant Health Agency Shrewsbury, Shropshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Borriello', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Veterinary Medicines Directorate, Addlestone, Surrey, UK.'}]"

33794378,"Pertussis among Patients with Clinically Compatible Illness in the Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,"Pertussis is an acute respiratory tract disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. In 2014, 24.1 million pertussis cases, resulting in 160,700 deaths were estimated to occur worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology of pertussis among patients with clinically compatible illness who visited selected hospitals in the Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia.
Cross-sectional study design was employed on pertussis patients with clinically compatible illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from five hundred-fifteen patients from July 2018 through February 2019. DNA was extracted from all nasopharyngeal swabs and samples were analyzed using real-time (RT-) PCR. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis, respectively.
The overall prevalence of Bordetella species among study participants was 156/515 (30.3%) [95% CI = 26.4-34.6] as determined by Bordetella RT-PCR, including 65/156 (41.7%) B. pertussis, 89/156 (57.1%) indeterminate B. pertussis, 1/156 (0.6%) B. holmesii and 1/156 (0.6%) B. parapertussis.

33789161,Lipid binding by the N-terminal motif mediates plasma membrane localization of Bordetella effector protein BteA.,The Journal of biological chemistry,"The respiratory pathogens Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica employ a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject a 69-kDa BteA effector protein into host cells. This effector is known to contain two functional domains, including an N-terminal lipid raft-targeting (LRT) domain, and a cytotoxic C-terminal domain that induces non-apoptotic and caspase-1-independent host cell death. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of BteA with plasma membrane as well as its cytotoxic activity in the course of Bordetella infections remain poorly understood. Using a protein-lipid overlay assay and surface plasmon resonance, we show here that the recombinant LRT domain binds negatively-charged membrane phospholipids. Specifically, we determined that the dissociation constants of the LRT domain binding liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidic acid (PA), and phosphatidylserine (PS) were ∼450 nM, ∼490 nM, and ∼1.2 μM, respectively. Both PS and PIP2 were required to target the LRT domain and/or full-length BteA to the plasma membrane of yeast cells. The membrane association further involved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of LRT, and depended on a leucine residue in the L1 loop between the first two helices of the four-helix bundle. Importantly, charge-reversal substitutions within the L1 region disrupted plasma membrane localization of the BteA effector without hampering its cytotoxic activity during B. bronchiseptica infection of HeLa cells. The LRT-mediated targeting of BteA to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane of host cells is, therefore, dispensable for effector cytotoxicity.",10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100607,"[{'lastname': 'Malcova', 'firstname': 'Ivana', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Bumba', 'firstname': 'Ladislav', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Uljanic', 'firstname': 'Filip', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuzmenko', 'firstname': 'Darya', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Nedomova', 'firstname': 'Jana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamanova', 'firstname': 'Jana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.

Based on data from the US SEER-18 program from 2001-2017, the age-standardized incidence rate for MZL was 19.6 per 1,000,000 person-years; 9% of MZL cases were splenic MZL (SMZL), 30% nodal MZL (NMZL), and 61% extranodal MZL (EMZL) of mucusa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Incidence rates were slightly higher in men for SMZL and NMZL, but similar for EMZL, and increased steeply with age for all MZL subtypes. The incidence (age-standardized per 1,000,000) of MZL was highest among non-Hispanic whites (20.7), followed by Hispanics of all races (17.6), non-Hispanic blacks (15.4), and Asian/Pacific islanders (15.0). The incidence of MZL increased +1.0% per year in the US from 2001-2017, with increases reported in other countries during this timeframe. The 5-year relative survival rate for MZL in the US was 89.8% and was similar across racial/ethnic groups and by sex; survival rates have been increasing in the US and other countries.

Apparent IVIg-related Bbsl seroconversion could lead to incorrect diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. This cohort study was designed to determine how often IVIg treatment leads to apparent Bbsl seroconversion and whether antibodies disappear post-treatment.
Sera from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and myositis patient were analyzed, drawn pre-treatment and 6-12 weeks after start of IVIg.. In patients with apparent seroconversion follow-up samples after treatment withdrawal were analyzed, if available. Patients treated with corticosteroids were included as controls. A two-tier protocol was used for serological testing, consisting of the C6 Lyme ELISA (Oxford Immunotec) and confirmation by IgM and IgG immunoblot (Mikrogen).
We included 61 patients: 51 patients were treated with IVIg and 10 with dexamethasone. Of patients treated with IVIg, 42 had CIDP (82%), all were treated with Nanogam® (Sanquin Plasma Products). Nine patients had myositis (18%) and were treated with Privigen® (CSL Behring). Anti-Bbsl IgG seroprevalence pre-treatment was 3% (2/61). Apparent seroconversion during IVIg treatment occurred in 39% of patients (20/51), all treated with Nanogam®. Post-treatment seroreversion occurred in 92% of patients (12/13) with available follow up samples; in 78% (7/9) seroreversion was observed within 3 months.
Transient presence of anti-Bbsl IgG antibodies after IVIg is regularly observed. This effect appears to be dependent on the IVIg brand, probably reflecting variation in Bbsl exposure of plasma donors. Lyme borreliosis serological testing during, and weeks to months after IVIg, is therefore of limited utility.",10.1111/ene.14853,"[{'lastname': 'Lucke', 'firstname': 'Ilse M', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and clinical Neurophysiology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Vrijlandt', 'firstname': 'Amber', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Johan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and clinical Neurophysiology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Kooi', 'firstname': 'Anneke J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and clinical Neurophysiology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Schaik', 'firstname': 'Ivo N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and clinical Neurophysiology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nSpaarne Gasthuis, Haarlem, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaaijer', 'firstname': 'Hans L', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, and Sanquin Blood Supply Foundation, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Hovius', 'firstname': 'Joppe W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Eftimov', 'firstname': 'Filip', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and clinical Neurophysiology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}]"
33812741,Vaccination with meningococcal outer membrane vesicles carrying Borrelia OspA protects against experimental Lyme borreliosis.,Vaccine,"Currently there is no human vaccine against Lyme borreliosis, and most research focuses on recombinant protein vaccines, as such a vaccine has been proven to be successful in the past. The expression of recombinant antigens in meningococcal Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), with the OMV functioning both as adjuvant and delivery vehicle, greatly enhances their potential. Immunization studies in mice have shown that OMV-based vaccines can protect against various pathogens and an OMV-based meningococcal vaccine is approved and available for human use. Because of its surface localization in Borrelia and the detailed knowledge regarding its immunogenicity and structure, OspA was chosen as a suitable lipoprotein to be tested as an OMV-based vaccine against Lyme borreliosis. We have previously shown that the OMV-OspA vaccine was immunogenic in mice and here we assessed the efficacy of OMV-OspA. We generated a second-generation OMV-OspA vaccine and vaccinated C3H/HeN mice with (EDTA extracted) meningococcal OMVs expressing OspA from B. burgdorferi strain B31. The adjuvant effect of empty OMVs on recombinant OspA was tested as well. We subsequently challenged mice with a subcutaneous injection of B. burgdorferi. Average antibody end-point titers against the OspA-OMV construct were high, although lower compared to the antibodies raised against recombinant OspA. Interestingly, antibody titers between recombinant OspA adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide and recombinant OspA with OMV as adjuvant were comparable. Finally, qPCR and culture data show that both the OspA-OMV and the vaccine based on recombinant OspA with OMV as adjuvant provided significant, yet partial protection, against Borrelia infection. OMV-based vaccines using Borrelia (lipo)proteins are an easy and feasible vaccination method protecting against B. burgdorferi infection and could be a promising strategy in humans.",10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.03.059,"[{'lastname': 'Klouwens', 'firstname': 'M J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Center for Experimental and Molecular Medicine, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Amsterdam Multidisciplinary Lyme borreliosis Center, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and quantity of Brucella spp. in sheep and goat raw milk, as well as artisanal cheeses produced in the North-west of Iran. To evaluate the intrinsic parameters that may affect the survival of Brucella spp., some of the cheese properties (e.g., pH, salt, moisture, and storage time before selling) were also assessed. A total of 572 samples consisting in 214 sheep raw milk, 92 goat raw milk, and 266 local artisanal cheese samples were collected. The artisanal cheeses were manufactured from a mixture of raw sheep and goat milk. According to the results, using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), 17.29%, 15.22%, and 22.93% of the sheep raw milk, goat raw milk, and artisanal cheese samples were found positive for Brucella spp., respectively. In comparison with culture assay, qPCR was 3.5 to 5 times (p < 0.05) more sensitive in the detection of Brucella spp. The results also revealed that the mean values of Brucella spp. load in sheep and goat raw milk and artisanal cheeses were 1.22, 1.55, and 1.43 log cell/ml or g, respectively. A positive correlation was found between Brucella load and successful detection of Brucella spp. by culture assay.

Fifty heifers calves were enrolled [38 Gyr (Zebu, Bos taurus indicus) and 12 5/8 Holstein x Gyr]. At 120 days of age, animals were randomly distributed among three groups: B (n = 18), vaccinated against brucellosis; C (n = 14), vaccinated against clostridia and CB (n = 18), vaccinated concomitantly for both. Rectal (RT) and thermographic temperatures were evaluated on days -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7,10, 14, and 28 relatives to the vaccination day. Feed and water intake, body weight (BW) and feeding behavior were monitored daily by an electronic feeding system. Blood was sampled on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28, relative to the vaccination day for determination of glucose (GLC) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations. Blood sampled on day 0 (pre-vaccination) and on day 28 and 42 were used to evaluate the immune response against Brucella abortus and clostridia. There was an increase in rectal temperature between the first and the third day post-vaccination in the three groups. The thermography revealed an increase of local temperature for seven days on groups B and CB. Group C had increased local temperature for a longer period, lasting for up to 14 d. Dry mater intake was reduced for groups B and CB, but no alteration was observed for group C. No alterations regarding initial BW, final BW, average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed efficiency were observed. No differences were observed for the three vaccination groups for blood parameters throughout the evaluation period. The concomitant vaccination against brucellosis and clostridia led to lower neutralizing antibody titers against epsilon toxin of C. perfringens and botulinum toxin type C of C. botulinum (C > CB > B). When cellular proliferation assay and serological tests to B. abortus were evaluated, no differences were observed between groups B and CB. The present results indicate that the concomitant vaccination against brucellosis and clostridia has no relevant impact on the intake, performance, and feeding behavior of dairy calves.

These data and the techniques implemented in the present study can shed light on the level of implication of different Brucella species in ovine and caprine abortion in Iran. The present study identified Brucella agents responsible for abortion in small ruminants at the biovar level.

33771234,"Molecular characteristics of Brucella melitensis isolates from humans in Qinghai Province, China.",Infectious diseases of poverty,"The prevalence of human brucellosis in Qinghai Province of China has been increasing rapidly, with confirmed cases distributed across 31 counties. However, the epidemiology of brucellosis transmission has not been fully elucidated. To characterize the infecting strains isolated from humans, multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based approaches were employed.
Strains were isolated from two males blood cultures that were confirmed Brucella melitensis positive following biotyping and MLVA. Genomic DNA was extracted from these two strains, and whole-genome sequencing was performed. Next, SNP-based phylogenetic analysis was performed to compare the two strains to 94 B. melitensis strains (complete genome and draft genome) retrieved from online databases.
The two Brucella isolates were identified as B. melitensis biovar 3 (QH2019001 and QH2019005) following conventional biotyping and were found to have differences in their variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) using MLVA-16. Phylogenetic examination assigned the 96 strains to five genotype groups, with QH2019001 and QH2019005 assigned to the same group, but different subgroups. Moreover, the QH2019005 strain was assigned to a new subgenotype, IIj, within genotype II. These findings were then combined to determine the geographic origin of the two Brucella strains.
Utilizing a whole-genome SNP-based approach enabled differences between the two B. melitensis strains to be more clearly resolved, and facilitated the elucidation of their different evolutionary histories. This approach also revealed that QH2019005 is a member of a new subgenotype (IIj) with an ancient origin in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.",10.1186/s40249-021-00829-0,"[{'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Zhi-Jun', 'initials': 'ZJ', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Ji-Quan', 'initials': 'JQ', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Plague Prevention and Research, Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, National Health Commission (2019PT310004) and Key Laboratory for Plague Prevention and Control of Qinghai Province, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xue', 'firstname': 'Hong-Mei', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Xu-Xin', 'initials': 'XX', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Yuan-Bo', 'initials': 'YB', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qin', 'firstname': 'Yu-Min', 'initials': 'YM', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Wen', 'initials': 'XW', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Piao', 'firstname': 'Dong-Ri', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Hong-Yan', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tian', 'firstname': 'Guo-Zhong', 'initials': 'GZ', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Qiang', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jian-Ling', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tian', 'firstname': 'Guang', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Hai', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China. jianghai@icdc.cn.\nState Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Collaborative Innovation Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China. jianghai@icdc.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Li-Qing', 'initials': 'LQ', 'affiliation': 'Qinghai Institute for Endemic Disease Prevention and Control, The department of brucellosis prevention and control, Xining, 810021, Qinghai, China. qhxlq2006@163.com.'}]"

The present study describes the case numbers, constituent ratios, and incidence rate of human brucellosis. Conventional bio-typing, i.e., abortus, melitensis, ovis and suis (AMOS)-PCR, and multi-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) were used to characterize the Brucella strains. Between 2003 and 2018, a total of 23,897 human brucellosis cases were reported, with an incidence rate of 56.03/100 000, which is 20 times higher than the country's average incidence. This incidence rate increased year after year, culminating in 2005, and decreased between 2011 and 2018. Because Hulun Buir relies on a nomadic livestock rearing system, brucellosis spreads easily among different animal species and humans. In Xin Barag Left Banner and Xin Barag Right Banner, the incidence rates were respectively 226.54/100 000 and 199.10/100 000, exceeding those observed in other areas. Most of the cases occurred in the (25-45)-year old group, accounting for 65.74% of the cases (15,709/23,897), and among farmers, accounting for 66.71% (15,942/23,897). The male to female incidence ratio was 2.67:1. The higher incidence in younger people and the large gender ratio reflected the unique traditional production and lifestyle of nomads. Most reported cases were observed from April to June, indicating that more than 40% of the cases were related to the delivery of domestic livestock. The biotyping showed that the 44 isolated strains were all B. melitensis, including 12 Brucella melitensis biovar (bv) 1, and 32 B. melitensis bv. 3. The strains displayed a genetic similarity of 80-100%. Our hypothesis is that human brucellosis outbreak in this region may be originating from a limited source of infection, so further investigation is necessary. The epidemic situation of human brucellosis in Hulun Buir is extremely serious, strengthened surveillance and control in animals' brucellosis should be priority.",10.1111/tbed.14075,"[{'lastname': 'Zhiguo', 'firstname': 'Liu', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, National Institute of Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, 102206.\nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region Central for Comprehensive Disease Control and Prevention, Huhhot, 010031, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Dongyan', 'firstname': 'Liu', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Hulun Buir Center for Endemic Disease Control and Prevention, Horqin, 028000, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Miao', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Central for Comprehensive Disease Control and Prevention, Huhhot, 010031, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhenjun', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Ulanqab central for endemic disease control and prevention, Ulanqab, 102000, China.'}]"

In this work, we tested a new delivery system for mucosal immunization with BLSOmp31 in the murine model to improve the efficacy of previously used formulations. First, we evaluated the protective efficacy against B. ovis induced by BLSOmp31 administered by the subcutaneous route using either BLSOmp31 alone, co-administered with immunostimulatory synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine motifs (CpG-ODN) or with CpG-ODN in a nanostructure called Coa-ASC16 compared with BLSOmp31 emulsified in Incomplete Freund Adjuvant. Then, we evaluated the protection conferred by the best performing formulation (BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16) administered by both subcutaneous and ocular routes. BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16 injected subcutaneously did not induce higher IgG antibody levels compared to BLSOmp31 alone or BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN but it did stimulate a mixed immune Th1-Th2 response with the highest levels of IFN-ɣ and conferred significant protection against the B. ovis challenge. Although ocular instillation of BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16 showed a similar degree of protection compared to the parenteral route (3.66 and 3.60 logs of protection, respectively), it induced lower levels in serum of specific IgG (with mixed IgG1/IgG2a) and IgA antibodies and, less IFN-ɣ and IL-4 than the subcutaneous route. No antibodies were detected in vaginal lavages or saliva. Fecal antigen-specific IgA was slightly higher in mice immunized with BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16 subcutaneously compared with the ocular route. These results indicate that BLSOmp31/CpG-ODN/Coa-ASC16 was a safe and effective vaccine against B. ovis in mice.",10.1016/j.rvsc.2021.02.011,"[{'lastname': 'Moran', 'firstname': 'María Celeste', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Laboratorio de Inmunología, Departamento de Sanidad Animal y Medicina Preventiva (SAMP), Centro de Investigación Veterinaria Tandil (CIVETAN-CONICET-CICPBA), Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias (FCV), Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (UNCPBA), Tandil, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Laboratorio de Microbiología Clínica y Experimental, Departamento SAMP, CIVETAN-CONICET-CICPBA., F.C.V, U.N.C.P.B.A., Tandil, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Bence', 'firstname': 'Angel Ricardo', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Laboratorio de Inmunología, Departamento de Sanidad Animal y Medicina Preventiva (SAMP), Centro de Investigación Veterinaria Tandil (CIVETAN-CONICET-CICPBA), Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias (FCV), Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (UNCPBA), Tandil, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Departamento de Fisiopatología, F.C.V, U.N.C.P.B.A., Tandil, Buenos Aires., Argentina; Comisión de Investigaciones Científicas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (CICPBA), Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Vallecillo', 'firstname': 'María Fernanda Sánchez', 'initials': 'MFS', 'affiliation': 'Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas, Departamento de Bioquímica Clínica, CIBICI (CONICET), Córdoba, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Lützelschwab', 'firstname': 'Claudia María', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Veterinary Public Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, SLU, Box 7028, SE-750-07, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodriguez', 'firstname': 'Marcelo Gastón', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Área de Bioestadística.

We developed a fourplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay for the electrophoresis-free, rapid and cost-effective differentiation of B. abortus and B. melitensis from the other Brucella spp. The 4-plex species differentiation assay was combined with a qPCR assay targeting 17 different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in Brucella genomes. This combination resulted in a 21 Variable Genome Loci (21-VGL) qPCR assay for high resolution genotyping of B. abortus and B. melitensis. A total of 486 Brucella was analyzed using the qPCR assay to create a 21-VGL profile database. The database contained the profiles of 55 B. abortus, 352 B. melitensis, 3 B. ceti, 6 B. neotomae, 7 B. ovis, 6 B. pinnipedialis, 44 B. suis and 13 B. canis strains. The 21-VGL Brucella genotyping clearly distinguished B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. neotomae and B. ovis. The 21-VGL approach could not distinguish B. pinnipedialis from B. ceti and some B. suis genotypes from B. canis. The results revealed that more than 99% of the Brucella isolates in Turkey were B. melitensis and 21-VGL genotyping can be reduced to 8-VGL B. melitensis genotyping without any loss of genotyping resolution.

33743687,New Brucella variant isolated from Croatian cattle.,BMC veterinary research,"A novel Brucella strain closely related to Brucella (B.) melitensis biovar (bv) 3 was found in Croatian cattle during testing within a brucellosis eradication programme.
Standardised serological, brucellin skin test, bacteriological and molecular diagnostic screening for Brucella infection led to positive detection in one dairy cattle herd. Three isolates from that herd were identified to species level using the Bruce ladder method. Initially, two strains were typed as B. melitensis and one as B. abortus, but multiplex PCR based on IS711 and the Suis ladder showed that all of them to belong to B. melitensis, and the combination of whole-genome and multi-locus sequencing as well as Multi-Locus Variable numbers of tandem repeats Analysis (MLVA) highlighted a strong proximity within the phylogenetic branch of B. melitensis strains previously isolated from Croatia, Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two isolates were determined to be B. melitensis bv. 3, while the third showed a unique phylogenetic profile, growth profile on dyes and bacteriophage typing results. This isolate contained the 609-bp omp31 sequence, but not the 723-bp omp31 sequence present in the two isolates of B. melitensis bv. 3.
Identification of a novel Brucella variant in this geographic region is predictable given the historic endemicity of brucellosis. The emergence of a new variant may reflect a combination of high prevalence among domestic ruminants and humans as well as weak eradication strategies. The zoonotic potential, reservoirs and transmission pathways of this and other Brucella variants should be explored.",10.1186/s12917-021-02833-w,"[{'lastname': 'Spicic', 'firstname': 'Silvio', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bacteriology and Parasitology, Laboratory for Bacterial Zoonosis and Molecular Diagnostics of Bacterial Diseases, Croatian Veterinary Institute, Savska street 143, Zagreb, Croatia. spicic@veinst.hr.'}, {'lastname': 'Zdelar-Tuk', 'firstname': 'Maja', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bacteriology and Parasitology, Laboratory for Bacterial Zoonosis and Molecular Diagnostics of Bacterial Diseases, Croatian Veterinary Institute, Savska street 143, Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ponsart', 'firstname': 'Claire', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'French Agency for Food, Environmental & Occupational Health Safety (ANSES), Bacterial Zoonoses Unit - Animal Health Laboratory, National & OIE/FAO Animal Brucellosis Reference Laboratory, EU Reference Laboratory for Brucellosis, 14 rue Pierre et Marie Curie, Maisons-Alfort, Cedex, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Hendriksen', 'firstname': 'Rene S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Technical University of Denmark, National Food Institute, Research Group for Genomic Epidemiology, Kemitorvet, Building 204, 2800, Kgs.

33822465,"Burkholderia cenocepacia BCAM2418-induced antibody inhibits bacterial adhesion, confers protection to infection and enables identification of host glycans as adhesin targets.",Cellular microbiology,"Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins (TAA) found in Gram-negative bacteria play a key role in virulence. This is the case of Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), a group of related bacteria able to cause infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. These bacteria use TAAs, among other virulence factors, to bind to host protein receptors and their carbohydrate ligands. Blocking such contacts is an attractive approach to inhibit Bcc infections. In this study, using an antibody produced against the TAA BCAM2418 from the epidemic strain Burkholderia cenocepacia K56-2, we were able to uncover its roles as an adhesin and the type of host glycan structures that serve as recognition targets. The neutralization of BCAM2418 was found to cause a reduction in the adhesion of the bacteria to bronchial cells and mucins. Moreover, in vivo studies have shown that the anti-BCAM2418 antibody exerted an inhibitory effect during infection in Galleria mellonella. Finally, inferred by glycan arrays, we were able to predict for the first time, host glycan epitopes for a TAA. We show that BCAM2418 favoured binding to 3'sialyl-3-fucosyllactose, histo-blood group A, α-(1,2)-linked Fuc-containing structures, Lewis structures and GM1 gangliosides. Additionally, the glycan microarrays demonstrated similar specificities of Burkholderia species for their most intensely binding carbohydrates. This article is protected by copyright.

33818654,Isolation and screening of potassium solubilizing bacteria from saxicolous habitat and their impact on tomato growth in different soil types.,Archives of microbiology,"Bacteria that solubilize nutrients in the soil are commonly used as bio-inoculants for promoting the growth of different crop species. However, the influence of potassium (K) solubilizing bacteria (KSB) originating from saxicolous habitat (rock-dwelling) on plant growth has not been frequently examined. In this study, we isolated KSB from saxicolous habitats and estimated their ability to produce plant growth hormone, organic acids, and siderophore that may facilitate plant growth. Fifteen culturable saxicolous bacterial isolates with varied K solubilizing ability were isolated from two sites. Of these, four potential K solubilizers were selected and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The four bacterial isolates resembled Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, and Burkholderia cenocepacia and produced different organic acids, indole acetic acid, and siderophore under in vitro conditions. Potassium solubilization differed among the bacterial isolates and was significantly influenced by K sources. Inoculation of KSB improved the tomato plant growth parameters like plant height, leaf area, total root length, root/shoot ratio, and tissue K content in sterilized and unsterilized Alfisol, and Vertisol soils under greenhouse conditions. We also observed higher residual K content in the KSB inoculated post-harvest soils. Among the four KSB isolates screened, B. licheniformis and B. cenocepacia presents an excellent prospect as bio-inoculants for improving tomato growth in different soil types. Besides these, the enriched K content in the post-harvest soils may help the growth of subsequent crops in sustainable agriculture.","10.1007/s00203-021-02284-9

33781425,Designing of Western Blot Technique for Glanders Diagnosing in Iran.,Journal of equine veterinary science,"Burkholderia mallei is the etiologic agent of glanders. It is difficult to diagnose this zoonotic disease in its early stages. Some methods such as the complement fixation test (CFT) cause some problems for veterinary authorities and financial losses to animal owners due to false-positive results. The mallein test requires appropriate laboratory equipment and skilled personnel. To quickly and accurately diagnose the disease, especially in areas where animals cannot be kept, new methods (such as the Western blot test [WBT]) should be used to identify the disease. This study designed and optimized the Western blot (immunoblot) test using sera from 84 glanderous equids, and the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA and CFT were compared with the WBT. ELISA tests are based on B. mallei antigens whereas a purified lipopolysaccharide-containing B. mallei antigen is used in the WBT. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests were estimated using the cut-off values recommended by the test developers. The WBT and ELISA were significantly more specific than the CFT. The ELISA based on B. mallei antigens was significantly less sensitive than the CFT. Given their comparable sensitivities and specificities, the CFT (95.7%, 98.5%), the WBT (95%, 100%) and the ELISA (85%, 100%) should be further developed. The CFT is still the prescribed technique for serological investigation of equids for trade purposes to certify individual animals without glanders. Therefore, more efforts should be made to further improve and optimize the WBT and ELISA tests.",10.1016/j.jevs.2021.103403,"[{'lastname': 'Shakibamehr', 'firstname': 'Nafiseh', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Karaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mosavari', 'firstname': 'Nader', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Reference Laboratory of Bovine Tuberculosis, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran.

33068441,Cefiderocol: A Novel Siderophore Cephalosporin against Multidrug-Resistant Gram-Negative Pathogens.,Pharmacotherapy,"Cefiderocol (CFDC), (formerly S-649266), is a novel injectable siderophore cephalosporin developed by Shionogi & Co., Ltd., with potent in vitro activity against Gram-negative pathogens including multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Characterized by its siderophore catechol-moiety, CFDC uses a ""trojan-horse approach"" to navigate through the bacterial periplasmic space, thus evading various beta-lactam degrading enzymes and other mechanisms of resistance present in Gram-negative bacteria. More specifically in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, CFDC has been shown to have activity against extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), such as CTX-type, SHV-type, and TEM-type, as well as the Ambler classes of beta-lactamases, including class A (KPC), class B (NDM, IMP, and VIM), class C (AmpC), and class D (OXA, OXA-24, OXA-48, and OXA-48-like). In addition to the strong activity that CFDC has been shown to have against MDR P. aeruginosa, it has also displayed activity against the OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA-51, beta-lactamases commonly found in MDR A. baumannii. Cefiderocol was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, for use in patients 18 years or older with limited or no alternative options for treatment, and is currently being evaluated in a phase III trial for use in nosocomial pneumonia caused by Gram-negative pathogens. The unique features and enhanced activity of CFDC suggest that it is likely to serve as a viable therapeutic option in the treatment of MDR Gram-negative infections. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of previously published literature explaining CFDC's pharmacology, pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic (PK / PD) properties, microbiologic activity, resistance mechanisms, safety parameters, dosing and administration, clinical data, and potential place in therapy.",10.1002/phar.2476,"[{'lastname': 'Abdul-Mutakabbir', 'firstname': 'Jacinda C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Anti-Infective Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.\nDepartment of Pharmacy Practice, Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy, Loma Linda, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Alosaimy', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Anti-Infective Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Morrisette', 'firstname': 'Taylor', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Anti-Infective Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kebriaei', 'firstname': 'Razieh', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Anti-Infective Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rybak', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Anti-Infective Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmacy Practice, Eugene Applebaum College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.\nDivision of Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.\nDepartment of Pharmacy, Detroit Receiving Hospital, Detroit, Michigan, USA.'}]"

32271750,Molecular and epidemiological analysis of a Burkholderia cepacia sepsis outbreak from a tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh.,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of serious pathogens in cystic fibrosis patients and causes life threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Species within the Bcc are widely distributed within the environment, can survive in the presence of disinfectants and antiseptics, and are inherently multidrug resistant (MDR).
Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) patients with a B. cepacia positive blood culture between 20 October 2016 to 23rd September 2017 were considered as outbreak cases. Blood stream infections (BSIs) were detected using BacT/ALERT 3D at DMCH. B. cepacia was isolated on chromogenic UTI media followed by MALDI-TOF. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of clinically relevant antibiotics was determined by agar dilution. Whole genome sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Patients' demographic and clinical data were collected. Patients' clinical history and genomic data of the outbreak strains were merged to investigate possible outbreaks. Ninety-one B. cepacia genomes were downloaded from 'Burkholderia Genome Database' and the genomic background of the global strains were compared with our outbreak strains.
Among 236 BSIs, 6.35% (15/236) were B. cepacia. Outbreak cases were confined to the burn critical care unit and, to a lesser extent, the paediatrics department. There was a continuum of overlapping cases at DMCH between 23 October 2016 to 30 August 2017. Core genome SNPs showed that the outbreak strains were confined to a single clade, corresponded to a common clone (ST1578). The strains were shown to be MDR and associated with a mortality of 31% excluding discharge against medical advice. MIC profiles of the strains suggested that antibiotics deployed as empirical therapy were invariably inappropriate. The genetic background of the outbreak strains was very similar; however, a few variations were found regarding the presence of virulence genes. Compared to global strains from the Burkholderia Genome Database, the Bangladeshi strains were genetically distinct.
Environmental surveillance is required to investigate the aetiology and mode of transmission of the B. cepacia outbreak. Systematic management of nosocomial outbreaks, particularly in resource limited regions, will mitigate transmission and will improve patients' outcomes.",10.1371/journal.pntd.0008200,"[{'lastname': 'Farzana', 'firstname': 'Refath', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Institute of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'Lim S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Public Health Wales Microbiology, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Rahman', 'firstname': 'Md Anisur', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Virology, Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Sands', 'firstname': 'Kirsty', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Institute of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Portal', 'firstname': 'Edward', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Institute of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Boostrom', 'firstname': 'Ian', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Institute of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalam', 'firstname': 'Md Abul', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery, Dhaka, Bangladesh.'}, {'lastname': 'Hasan', 'firstname': 'Brekhna', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Institute of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Khan', 'firstname': 'Afifah', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Institute of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Walsh', 'firstname': 'Timothy R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Institute of Infection and Immunity, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom.'}]"

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Campylobacter in chicken carcasses from slaughterhouses located in the states of Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul in the South of Brazil. The samples were analyzed for Campylobacter enumeration using the ISO method 10272-2 and the species C. jejuni and C. coli, important for public health, were identified through Maldi-TOF mass spectrometry. From July 2017 to July 2018, 816 samples were analyzed, indicating the prevalence of 35.84%, with higher occurrence of C. jejuni (78.47%). No difference in prevalence was observed in relation to the size of the slaughterhouses. However, significant differences were noted among the three states in the southern region of the country, with the lowest prevalence being observed in Parana. The results reinforce the need to advance in the implementation of strategies to control this pathogen in the country, in order to safeguard consumer's health and contribute for the maintenance of Brazil's position in the international poultry meat market.","10.1007/s00284-021-02478-w

33829128,"Chicken eggs, childhood stunting and environmental hygiene: an ethnographic study from the ",One health outlook,"Childhood stunting and malnutrition condemn millions of people globally to a life of disadvantage and cognitive and physical impairment. Though increasing egg consumption is often seen as an important solution for low and middle income countries (including Ethiopia), emerging evidence suggests that greater exposure to poultry feces may also inhibit child growth due to the effects of enteric bacteria, especially 
In this rapid ethnographic study, we explored village poultry production, child dietary practices, and environmental hygiene conditions as they relate to 
In the study area, we found that women assumed primary responsibility to care for both chickens and children: in feeding, housing, and healthcare. Most chickens were free-range local indigenous breeds, and flock sizes were small and unstable due to epidemics, seasonal trends, reproductive patterns, and lack of food. Generally, eggs were seen as ""too luxurious"" to be eaten, and were predominantly sold at local markets for scarce cash, despite high malnutrition rates. Local narratives of extreme poverty, social dietary norms, parental fatalism, and lack of ""dietary consciousness"" (as it was called) were invoked to explain this. We found that homesteads were highly contaminated with human and animal feces. Although community members viewed chicken feces and poultry gastrointestinal contents as particularly noxious in comparison to other animals because of their feeding behaviour, they did not relate them to any particular disease. Shared human-animal housing and childcare practices place children at high risk of exposure to enteric bacteria from animal manure, despite daily routines designed to manage the domestic landscape.
Addressing childhood stunting and malnutrition through egg production in rural landscapes like Haramaya must navigate three distinct health and care regimes: for children, chickens, and home environments. Interventions should be based on a holistic approach to social and economic empowerment, one that considers both women and men and integrates nutrition, health, and community change as its overarching goal.",10.1186/s42522-020-00012-9,"[{'lastname': 'Bardosh', 'firstname': 'Kevin Louis', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anthropology, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.\nCenter for One Health Research, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hussein', 'firstname': 'Jeylan Wolyie', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'College of Social Sciences and Humanities, Haramaya University, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sadik', 'firstname': 'Elias Ahmed', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'College of Social Sciences and Humanities, Haramaya University, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hassen', 'firstname': 'Jemal Yousuf', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rural Development and Agricultural Extension, Haramaya University, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ketema', 'firstname': 'Mengistu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness Management, Haramaya University, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ibrahim', 'firstname': 'Abdulmuen Mohammed', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rural Development and Agricultural Extension, Haramaya University, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'McKune', 'firstname': 'Sarah Lindley', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Environmental and Global Health, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Havelaar', 'firstname': 'Arie Hendrik', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Sciences, Emerging Pathogens Institute, Institute for Sustainable Food Systems, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA.'}]"

33830320,Prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in Chicken Carcasses in Slaughterhouses from South of Brazil.,Current microbiology,"Campylobacteriosis has become common cause of diarrhea in humans and is associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, Reactive Arthritis and Irritable Bowel Syndrome is caused mainly by contaminated food and water intake in which the majority occurs from manipulation, preparation and consumption of poultry meat. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Campylobacter in chicken carcasses from slaughterhouses located in the states of Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul in the South of Brazil. The samples were analyzed for Campylobacter enumeration using the ISO method 10272-2 and the species C. jejuni and C. coli, important for public health, were identified through Maldi-TOF mass spectrometry. From July 2017 to July 2018, 816 samples were analyzed, indicating the prevalence of 35.84%, with higher occurrence of C. jejuni (78.47%). No difference in prevalence was observed in relation to the size of the slaughterhouses. However, significant differences were noted among the three states in the southern region of the country, with the lowest prevalence being observed in Parana. The results reinforce the need to advance in the implementation of strategies to control this pathogen in the country, in order to safeguard consumer's health and contribute for the maintenance of Brazil's position in the international poultry meat market.","10.1007/s00284-021-02478-w

33833484,Non-responsive celiac disease in children on a gluten free diet.,World journal of gastroenterology,"Non-responsive celiac disease (NRCD) is defined as the persistence of symptoms in individuals with celiac disease (CeD) despite being on a gluten-free diet (GFD). There is scant literature about NRCD in the pediatric population.
To determine the incidence, clinical characteristics and underlying causes of NRCD in children.
Retrospective cohort study performed at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). Children < 18 years diagnosed with CeD by positive serology and duodenal biopsies compatible with Marsh III histology between 2008 and 2012 were identified in the BCH's Celiac Disease Program database. Medical records were longitudinally reviewed from the time of diagnosis through September 2015. NRCD was defined as persistent symptoms at 6 mo after the initiation of a GFD and causes of NRCD as well as symptom evolution were detailed. The children without symptoms at 6 mo (responders) were compared with the NRCD group. Additionally, presenting signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis of CeD among the responders and NRCD patients were collected and compared to identify any potential predictors for NRCD at 6 mo of GFD therapy.
Six hundred and sixteen children were included. Ninety-one (15%) met criteria for NRCD. Most were female (77%). Abdominal pain [odds ratio (OR) 1.8 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9], constipation (OR 3.1 95%CI 1.9-4.9) and absence of abdominal distension (OR for abdominal distension 0.4 95%CI 0.1-0.98) at diagnosis were associated with NRCD. NRCD was attributed to a wide variety of diagnoses with gluten exposure (30%) and constipation (20%) being the most common causes. Other causes for NRCD included lactose intolerance (9%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), functional abdominal pain (7%), irritable bowel syndrome (3%), depression/anxiety (3%), eosinophilic esophagitis (2%), food allergy (1%), eating disorder (1%), gastric ulcer with 
NRCD after ≥ 6 mo GFD is frequent among children, especially females, and is associated with initial presenting symptoms of constipation and/or abdominal pain.

33833389,"A comparative study of Helicobacter pylori infection in hamsters experimentally infected with liver flukes Opisthorchis felineus, Opisthorchis viverrini, or Clonorchis sinensis.",Scientific reports,"Helicobacter pylori causes a wide range of human diseases including cancer. Carcinogenic foodborne trematodes Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis, and O. felineus might promote transmission and spread of H. pylori infection in the definitive mammalian host, which in turn might contribute to the liver fluke-associated malignancy. Our objectives were to find out whether liver flukes O. felineus, O. viverrini, and C. sinensis are carriers of Helicobacter pylori and to determine whether H. pylori is present in feces, bile, and stomach samples from the experimentally infected hamsters. We found that liver flukes are not reservoirs of H. pylori. Nevertheless, the prevalence of H. pylori and the H. pylori ureA gene copy number were significantly elevated after the infection. Overall, although the liver flukes O. felineus, C. sinensis, and O. viverrini are not reservoirs of H. pylori, the infection with the liver flukes significantly modifies the biliary and gut microbiota by increasing H. pylori abundance. This may be a feature of any liver fluke pathogenesis that have not previously been taken into account. Our findings appear to be novel in terms of comparative assessment of the host microbiota and Helicobacter abundance during epidemiologically important liver fluke infections.","10.1038/s41598-021-87446-x

33832076,Intravenous versus oral omeprazole on patients with high risk bleeding peptic ulcers: A prospective randomized clinical trial protocol.,Medicine,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) decrease the rate of rebleeding following endoscopic hemostatic therapy in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. This study compares the efficacy of oral omeprazole vs intravenous omeprazole in decrease of rebleeding of peptic ulcer patients.
The present study was authorized by the local research ethics committee of Jiangjin District Central Hospital (2020120987) and informed consent was obtained from all patients. All adult patients who were admitted to medical emergency rooms of Jiangjin District Central Hospital due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (as evidenced by hematemesis, melena or hematochezia) were considered for inclusion in the study. Endoscopy was performed within 24 hours after admission. Patients older than 18 years with successful endoscopic therapy of high risk ulcers [defined as active bleeding (Forrest IA, IB), non-bleeding visible vessel (NBVV, Forrest IIA) or adherent clots (Forrest IIB)] were enrolled. Patients with low risk ulcers (clean base, ulcers with a simple washable clot), suspicious malignant ulcer, bleeding tendency, uremia, liver cirrhosis, Mallory Weiss tear or already on PPI as an outpatient were excluded from study. All were managed endoscopically by injecting 5-30 ml of epinephrine (diluted 1:10000) around the ulcer crater. Cavitations or flattening of bleeding vessel and disappearance of NBVV was considered as established homeostasis. A biopsy was taken from antrum for evaluating Helicobacter pylori infection. Patient with unsuccessful endoscopic therapy were not enrolled and were referred to general surgeon. Information on demography, history of previous upper gastrointestinal bleeding, NSAID or ASA ingestion, ulcer location, bleeding stigmata and blood transfusion volume at entry were recorded in all patients. In the oral omeprazole group, the patients received 40 mg omeprazole orally twice daily for 72 hours. In intravenous omeprazole group, they received omeprazole 80 mg bolus and then 8 mg/hour infusion for 48-72 hours. Then, all patients received omeprazole 20 mg orally for 30 days. On the day of discharge Helicobacter pylori infected patients received standard regimens.
Figure 1 showed the primary and secondary end points.
Intravenous administration of PPIs has limitations. They are expensive, require a dedicated intravenous line, need nursing supervision and hospital admission. So, it would be reasonable to prescribe oral PPIs to patients with high risk bleeding ulcers provided that it is as effective as its intravenous counterpart. Oral PPIs have a high bioavailability. Its effect initiates one hour after ingestion and the maximal plasma concentration is achieved after 2-3 hours. However, there are few studies comparing oral and intravenous PPI in decreasing risk of rebleeding in peptic ulcer patients. More high quality randomized controlled trials are still necessary.

We report a case of API2-MALT1 positive gastric MALT lymphoma, treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).
A 51-year-old man underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for the annual health checkup examination.
The EGD showed a reddish depressed lesion with small reddish spots in the lower gastric body. There was no endoscopic atrophy in the entire stomach and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) serum test was negative. Infiltration of small lymphocytes was shown in the gastric tissues obtained by the endoscopic biopsy. The fluorescence in situ hybridization using the biopsy samples confirmed the presence of genetic translocation of API2-MALT1, suggesting that the lesion is API2-MALT1 positive MALT lymphoma.
Since endoscopic ultrasound suggested that the lesion was localized within the lamina propria mucosae, we performed ESD to achieve the en bloc resection of the lesion.
Conclusive diagnosis of gastric MALT lymphoma was made based on the resected specimen. Lateral and vertical margins were negative. No lymphoma cells were detected using endoscopic biopsy after 5 years.
Our report suggests that ESD can be considered as alternative treatment for API2-MALT1 positive gastric MALT lymphoma if the lesion was localized within the gastric mucosa.",10.1097/MD.0000000000024371,"[{'lastname': 'Tahara', 'firstname': 'Tomomitsu', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Osaka.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Horiguchi', 'firstname': 'Noriyuki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Terada', 'firstname': 'Tsuyoshi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoshida', 'firstname': 'Dai', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Okubo', 'firstname': 'Masaaki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Funasaka', 'firstname': 'Kohei', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakagawa', 'firstname': 'Yoshihito', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shibata', 'firstname': 'Tomoyuki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ohmiya', 'firstname': 'Naoki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}]"
33835175,Effectiveness of a Culturally Tailored HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Prevention Intervention for Black Women in Community Supervision Programs: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,JAMA network open,"Concentrated epidemics of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have persisted among Black women in community supervision programs (CSPs) in the United States. Accumulating research has highlighted the effectiveness of culturally tailored HIV/STI interventions for Black women; however, there is a dearth of such interventions for the large number of Black women in CSPs.
To determine the effectiveness of a 5-session culturally tailored group-based intervention (Empowering African-American Women on the Road to Health [E-WORTH]) with individualized computerized modules and streamlined HIV testing in reducing STIs and condomless sex vs a 1-session streamlined HIV testing control condition.
This randomized clinical trial was conducted from November 18, 2015, (first recruitment) to August 20, 2019 (last 12-month follow-up). Black women mandated to probation, parole, or alternative-to-incarceration programs in New York City who had a history of drug use were recruited and randomized to receive either E-WORTH or a streamlined HIV testing control condition. Both conditions were delivered by Black female staff at a large CSP. The analysis took an intention-to-treat approach.
E-WORTH included a 1-hour individual HIV testing and orientation session and 4 weekly 90-minute group sessions. The control condition included one 30-minute session of HIV testing and information.
Primary outcomes were incidence of any STI (biologically assayed chlamydia, gonorrhea, and Trichomonas vaginalis) at the 12-month assessment and the number of condomless acts of vaginal or anal intercourse in the past 90 days during the 12-month period.
A total of 352 participants who identified as Black or African American were enrolled, including 79 (22.5%) who also identified as Latinx. The mean (SD) age was 32.4 (11.0) years. A total of 172 participants (48.9%) were assigned to the E-WORTH condition, and 180 (51.1%) were assigned to the control condition. Compared with control participants, participants assigned to the E-WORTH condition had 54% lower odds of testing positive for any STI at the 12-month follow-up (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.88; P = .01) and reported 38% fewer acts of condomless vaginal or anal intercourse during the 12-month period (incidence rate ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.97; P = .04).
The magnitudes of effects found across biological and behavioral outcomes in this randomized clinical trial indicate the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing E-WORTH in real-world CSPs. The findings lend further evidence to the promise of culturally tailored HIV/STI interventions for Black women.

33834999,Unusual Clinical Presentation of Giant Extragenital Condyloma.,Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,"Dear editor, Condylomata accuminatum (CA) is a human papillomavirus (HPV) related sexually transmitted infection (STI), clinically characterized by solitary or even clustered dark red or pink lesions solely affecting the anogenital area (1). CA involving the extragenital, non-mucosal skin has been sporadically reported (2-4). Diagnosis of CA is usually straightforward when the lesions are located on the anogenital area. However, involvement of extragenital skin may pose a diagnostic challenge. Herein, we report a rare case of giant linear extragenital CA without coexisting genital lesions, diagnosed with a synergic intervention of dermatoscopy and clinics. A 70-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our department for an atypical asymptomatic seborrheic keratosis presenting as a linear verrucous plaque (20 × 2 cm) with few solitary reddish satellite papules on the abdomen (Figure 1, a). No similar lesions were present in both cutaneous and mucosal districts. Medical history was unremarkable, and the patient denied having recent sexual intercourse or any history of condylomas. Remarkably, the patient underwent a diet in the last 8 months that resulted in a loss of 30 kg. We employed dermatoscopy to further assess the lesions, highlighting a finger-like pattern on the main lesion (Figure 1, c), while satellite lesions presented a mosaic pattern (Figure 1, b). The clinical appearance and these dermatoscopic findings were suggestive of condyloma acuminatum (CA), but due to its extraordinary presentation we also performed an incisional biopsy. Histopathological examination reviled features compatible with the diagnosis of CA (Figure 1, d, e). To better characterized the HPV genotype (high-risk and low-risk HPV) a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from lesional tissue sample was performed and found HPV type 6 positivity. The lesions were successfully removed by electrosurgery. Regular follow-up was scheduled. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were also screened, namely syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia trachomatis, and HIV status. In addition, laboratory tests and imaging examinations (radiography of the chest and ultrasound examination of the abdomen) revealed no pathological findings. CA involving the extragenital skin has been reported within intertriginous areas, including the inframammary fold, the groin, and the axillary vault, as well as mucosal surface such as intraoral and conjunctival mucosa (1-5). In most cases, extragenital CA coexisted with genital lesions. Staples et al. reported three obese patients with extragenital CA on the skin of the abdominal pannus (3). However, all of the patients had involvement of the inguinal folds, from where the CA had extended. Generally, CA is acquired by genital, oral, or anal sexual contact. Among the wide spectrum of HPV genotypes, types 6 and 11 are responsible of 90% of CA (1). Our paradigmatic case allows us reflect on the concept of transitory immune dysregulation due to a significant amount of weight loss, and the position of the lesions in particular seems to suggest that frictional triggers may disrupt the barrier integrity, leading to higher probability of infection. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic tool with a significant role in the assessment of melanocytic and non-melanocytic skin tumors. Furthermore, the utility of dermatoscopy has expanded to the field of inflammatory and infectious skin disease, where dermoscopy enhances the differential diagnosis between them. Seborrheic keratosis, as the most common benign epithelial tumor, can occur anywhere in the skin excluding the palms, soles, and mucosa (6). In the anogenital area, seborrheic keratosis usually resembles CA. However, dermatoscopically, seborrheic keratosis can be immediately identified by the presence of milia-like cysts, comedo-like openings, fissures, finger-print structures, and sharply demarcated borders (6). In contrast, reports of CA dermoscopy suggested four different dermoscopic patterns: fingerlike, mosaic, knoblike, and the most commonly, an unspecific pattern (7). Our case showed that dermoscopy of extragenital CA presented a mosaic pattern in an early stage of CA, while fully developed lesions revealed a fingerlike pattern, as has previously been reported by Dong et al. (7), where two different stages of clinical development of CA exhibit distinctive dermoscopic patterns, which correlates with our case. We did not observe the typical dermoscopic features of seborrheic keratosis. CA arising in an extragenital area is very rare and perhaps also underestimated. Thus, dermatologists should be aware of this unusual presentation even in the absence of genital HPV involvement. Moreover, dermoscopy may facilitate CA recognition in a such uncommon location. To our knowledge, this is the first report of extragenital condyloma acuminatum documented dermoscopically.",,"[{'lastname': 'Jovic', 'firstname': 'Andrija', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Andrija Jovic, MD, Clinical Center of Nis, Clinic of Dermatovenereology , Bulevar Zorana Djindjica 48, Nis, Serbia; andrijajovic@rocketmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Kocic', 'firstname': 'Hristina', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Damiani', 'firstname': 'Giovanni', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Popovic', 'firstname': 'Danijela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Vidovic', 'firstname': 'Natasa', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Radevic', 'firstname': 'Tatjana', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zlatanovic', 'firstname': 'Zorana', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Popovic', 'firstname': 'Dejan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tiodorovic', 'firstname': 'Danica', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}]"

The pre-EPT cohort was a 3-year (11/2012-11/2015) retrospective chart review of AYA females positive for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) prior to introduction of EPT. An EPT protocol for CT and TV infections was implemented following legalization in Ohio in 2016. The post-EPT cohort was a prospective review of patients positive for CT and TV for 2 years (5/2016-5/2018) after EPT introduction. We evaluated EPT acceptance and compared reinfection rates (positive test 1-6 months after initial infection) in the pre-EPT versus post-EPT cohorts and by EPT acceptance.
Among patients offered EPT, 28% (67/237) with CT and 25% (24/97) with TV accepted EPT. There were no significant differences in the reinfection rates for CT or TV in the pre- versus post-EPT cohorts (CT: 24% (57/240) vs. 20% (38/192), p=0.42; TV: 23% (22/97) versus 14% (12/87), p=0.11).

Antibody screening for C. trachomatis has only (63%) sensitivity and (54%) specificity for detecting tubal infertility. On the other hand, the CHSP60 antibody testing has (44%) sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosing tubal infertility. A positive microimmunofluorescence (MIF) titer was observed in 12 of 18 (67%) females with the tubal problem, 31 of 64 (48%) with non-tubal infertility (P=0.3, OR=2.2, 95% CI=0.71 to 8.01). The CHSP60 antibodies were found in 8 of 18 (45%) females with tubal problem & 6 of 64 (9%) women with non-tubal infertility, power factor alpha α P=0.004, OR=9.3, 95% CI=2.1 to 43.2, power= 1.002 for n= 0.05). Incorporating CHSP60 and C. trachomatis antibodies testing gives an excellent positive probability proportion of 10 to diagnose C. trachomatis associated tubal infertility.
Conclusions: CHSP60 antibody testing is a more specific evaluation than antibody testing for C. trachomatis for predicting chlamydia-associated tubal infertility. Using these tests at the first infertility examination may help the immediate diagnosis for non-interceptive tubal infertility.",,"[{'lastname': 'Berestoviy', 'firstname': 'Vladyslav O', 'initials': 'VO', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}, {'lastname': 'Sokol', 'firstname': 'Inna V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahmood', 'firstname': 'Ahmad A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}, {'lastname': 'Ginzburg', 'firstname': 'Valentyna G', 'initials': 'VG', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY №3, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}, {'lastname': 'Govsieiev', 'firstname': 'Dmytro O', 'initials': 'DO', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE; DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, KYIV STATE MATERNITY HOSPITAL №5, KYIV, UKRAINEDEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}]"
33830980,"Use of Real-Time PCR for Chlamydia psittaci Detection in Human Specimens During an Outbreak of Psittacosis - Georgia and Virginia, 2018.",MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,"Psittacosis is typically a mild febrile respiratory illness caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci and usually transmitted to humans by infected birds (1). On average, 11 psittacosis cases per year were reported in the United States during 2000-2017. During August-October 2018, the largest U.S. psittacosis outbreak in 30 years (82 cases identified*) occurred in two poultry slaughter plants, one each in Virginia and Georgia, that shared source farms (2). CDC used C. psittaci real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test 54 human specimens from this outbreak. This was the largest number of human specimens from a single outbreak ever tested for C. psittaci using real-time PCR, which is faster and more sensitive than commercially available serologic tests. This represented a rare opportunity to assess the utility of multiple specimen types for real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci. C. psittaci was detected more frequently in lower respiratory specimens (59% [10 of 17]) and stool (four of five) than in upper respiratory specimens (7% [two of 28]). Among six patients with sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs tested, C. psittaci was detected only in sputum in five patients. Cycle threshold (Ct) values suggested bacterial load was higher in lower respiratory specimens than in nasopharyngeal swabs. These findings support prioritizing lower respiratory specimens for real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci. Stool specimens might also have utility for diagnosis of psittacosis.",10.15585/mmwr.mm7014a1,"[{'lastname': 'McGovern', 'firstname': 'Olivia L', 'initials': 'OL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kobayashi', 'firstname': 'Miwako', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shaw', 'firstname': 'Kelly A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Szablewski', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gabel', 'firstname': 'Julie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Holsinger', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Drenzek', 'firstname': 'Cherie', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brennan', 'firstname': 'Skyler', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Milucky', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Farrar', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wolff', 'firstname': 'Bernard J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Benitez', 'firstname': 'Alvaro J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Thurman', 'firstname': 'Kathleen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Diaz', 'firstname': 'Maureen H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Winchell', 'firstname': 'Jonas M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schrag', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]"

33551665,Leveraging Deep Learning for Designing Healthcare Analytics Heuristic for Diagnostics.,Neural processing letters,"Healthcare Informatics is a phenomenon being talked about from the early 21st century in the era in which we are living. With evolution of new computing technologies huge amount of data in healthcare is produced opening several research areas. Managing the massiveness of this data is required while extracting knowledge for decision making is the main concern of today. For this task researchers are doing explorations in big data analytics, deep learning (advanced form of machine learning known as deep neural nets), predictive analytics and various other algorithms to bring innovation in healthcare. Through all these innovations happening it is not wrong to establish that disease prediction with anticipation of its cure is no longer unrealistic. First, Dengue Fever (DF) and then Covid-19 likewise are new outbreak in infectious lethal diseases and diagnosing at all stages is crucial to decrease mortality rate. In case of Diabetes, clinicians and experts are finding challenging the timely diagnosis and analyzing the chances of developing underlying diseases. In this paper, Louvain Mani-Hierarchical Fold Learning healthcare analytics, a hybrid deep learning technique is proposed for medical diagnostics and is tested and validated using real-time dataset of 104 instances of patients with dengue fever made available by Holy Family Hospital, Pakistan and 810 instances found for infectious diseases including prognosis of; Covid-19, SARS, ARDS, Pneumocystis, Streptococcus, Chlamydophila, Klebsiella, Legionella, Lipoid, etc. on GitHub. Louvain Mani-Hierarchical Fold Learning healthcare analytics showed maximum 0.952 correlations between two clusters with Spearman when applied on 240 instances extracted from comorbidities diagnostic data model derived from 15696 endocrine records of multiple visits of 100 patients identified by a unique ID. Accuracy for induced rules is evaluated by Laplace (Fig. 8) as 0.727, 0.701 and 0.203 for 41, 18 and 24 rules, respectively. Endocrine diagnostic data is made available by Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, Pakistan.

33830980,"Use of Real-Time PCR for Chlamydia psittaci Detection in Human Specimens During an Outbreak of Psittacosis - Georgia and Virginia, 2018.",MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,"Psittacosis is typically a mild febrile respiratory illness caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci and usually transmitted to humans by infected birds (1). On average, 11 psittacosis cases per year were reported in the United States during 2000-2017. During August-October 2018, the largest U.S. psittacosis outbreak in 30 years (82 cases identified*) occurred in two poultry slaughter plants, one each in Virginia and Georgia, that shared source farms (2). CDC used C. psittaci real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test 54 human specimens from this outbreak. This was the largest number of human specimens from a single outbreak ever tested for C. psittaci using real-time PCR, which is faster and more sensitive than commercially available serologic tests. This represented a rare opportunity to assess the utility of multiple specimen types for real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci. C. psittaci was detected more frequently in lower respiratory specimens (59% [10 of 17]) and stool (four of five) than in upper respiratory specimens (7% [two of 28]). Among six patients with sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs tested, C. psittaci was detected only in sputum in five patients. Cycle threshold (Ct) values suggested bacterial load was higher in lower respiratory specimens than in nasopharyngeal swabs. These findings support prioritizing lower respiratory specimens for real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci. Stool specimens might also have utility for diagnosis of psittacosis.",10.15585/mmwr.mm7014a1,"[{'lastname': 'McGovern', 'firstname': 'Olivia L', 'initials': 'OL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kobayashi', 'firstname': 'Miwako', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shaw', 'firstname': 'Kelly A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Szablewski', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gabel', 'firstname': 'Julie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Holsinger', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Drenzek', 'firstname': 'Cherie', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brennan', 'firstname': 'Skyler', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Milucky', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Farrar', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wolff', 'firstname': 'Bernard J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Benitez', 'firstname': 'Alvaro J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Thurman', 'firstname': 'Kathleen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Diaz', 'firstname': 'Maureen H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Winchell', 'firstname': 'Jonas M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schrag', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]"
33774629,Mucosal Respiratory Syndrome: A Systematic Literature Review.,"Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)","Mycoplasma pneumoniae atypical pneumonia is frequently associated with erythema multiforme. Occasionally, a mycoplasma infection does not trigger any cutaneous but exclusively mucosal lesions. The term mucosal respiratory syndrome is employed to denote the latter condition. Available reviews do not address the possible association of mucosal respiratory syndrome with further atypical bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, or Legionella species. We therefore performed a systematic review of the literature addressing this issue in the National Library of Medicine, Excerpta Medica, and Web of Science databases.
We found 63 patients (≤18 years, n = 36; >18 years, n = 27; 54 males and 9 females) affected by a mucosal respiratory syndrome. Fifty-three cases were temporally associated with a M. pneumoniae and 5 with a C. pneumoniae infection.

33463503,[Clinical characteristics analysis of patients with pneumonia infected by Chlamydia psittaci].,Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,"To explore the clinical characteristics of pneumonia infected by Chlamydophila psittaci (C. psittaci).
A retrospective analysis was performed on 3 cases of C. psittaci pneumonia admitted to People's Hospital of Tongling City from July 2019 to January 2020. The patients' contact history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination, imaging characteristics and evolution, etiology, treatment process and outcome were analyzed, so as to provide experience for the diagnosis and prevention of C. psittaci pneumonia.
The 3 patients had been infected through pet or zoonotic exposures. All symptoms included high fever (body temperature > 39 centigrade), cough, sputum, chest tightness and dyspnea. The disease progressed rapidly, with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock as the main manifestations, but the damages to the heart, liver and kidney were mild. Laboratory tests showed that C-reactive protein (CRP, all > 200 mg/L) and neutrophil proportion (Neut%, > 0.90) were significantly increased, while white blood cell count (WBC) and procalcitonin (PCT) were not significantly increased. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed inflammatory infiltration with interstitial changes, either unilateral or bilateral. Chest X-ray showed large areas of inflammatory infiltrations, fan-shaped or wedge-shaped to the edge of pleura. After 7 days of treatment, the bedside computed X-ray (CR) showed absorption of infiltration. After 11-13 days, the CT reexamination indicated lung infection was basically absorbed. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) confirmed the presence of C. psittaci in patients' sputum. It was sensitive to quinolones and tetracyclines. The patients' body temperature dropped to normal after 2-3 days of antibiotics, and all patients were extubated and transferred to normal ward 10 days later. The total course of illness was 20-30 days.
The patients with C. psittaci pneumonia are critically ill, and clinical manifestations of moderate to severe ARDS and shock are common. Early diagnosis depends on mNGS, and reasonable treatment is important for prognosis.",10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200408-00259,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Intensive Care Unit, People's Hospital of Tongling City, Tongling 244000, Anhui, China.

33421260,Recommendations on off-label use of intravenous azithromycin in children.,International journal of clinical practice,"Intravenous azithromycin (AZM) has been widely used in children worldwide, but there still remains much concern regarding its off-label use, which urgently needs to be regulated. Therefore, we developed a rapid advice guideline in China to give recommendations of rational use of intravenous AZM in children.
This guideline focuses on antimicrobial therapy with intravenous AZM in children. The Delphi research method was used to select questions. A systematic literature review was also conducted. Data were pooled and ranked according to the GRADE system. Recommendations were developed based on expert clinical experience, patients' values and preferences, and evidence availability. After an external review, the recommendations were revised and approved.
This guideline included eighteen recommendations that covered four domains: (a) Indications: the treatment of pneumonia caused by atypical but common pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis or Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, more typical bacteria as well as the treatment of bronchitis of presumed bacterial aetiologies; (b) Usage and dosage: administration route, infusion concentrations, treatment duration, course of sequential treatment, and dosage stratified by age; (c) Adverse reactions and treatment: the management of gastrointestinal reactions, arrhythmias, pain or phlebitis at the infusion site, and anaphylaxis; and (d) Special population: children with renal or liver dysfunction, congenital heart disease, and obesity. This guideline will hopefully help promote a rational use of intravenous AZM in children worldwide.
This guideline has summarised the evidence and has developed recommendations on the use of intravenous AZM in children worldwide.

For specific detection of antibodies against C. pneumoniae, we developed novel ELISAs with strongly reactive individual peptide antigens and mixtures of these peptides. By comparison to a composite reference standard (CRS) for anti-C. pneumoniae antibody status of human sera, the top-performing CpnMixF12 peptide assay showed 91% sensitivity at 95% specificity, significantly higher than 4 commercial anti-C. pneumoniae IgG ELISAs (36-12% sensitivity at 95% specificity). Human C. pneumoniae (Cpn) and C. trachomatis (Ctr) seroreactivity was 54% biased towards co-positivity in commercial Cpn and Ctr ELISAs, but unbiased in Cpn and Ctr peptide antibody assays, suggesting severe cross-reactivity of commercial ELISAs. Using hyperimmune mouse sera against each of 11 Chlamydia spp., we confirm that commercial Cpn and Ctr ELISA antigens are cross-reactive among all Chlamydia spp., but Cpn and Ctr peptide antigens react only with antisera against the cognate chlamydial species.

31284867,Synthesis and Assessment of 3-Substituted Phenazines as Novel Antichlamydial Agents.,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),"In the past century, many phenazines were isolated from the marine microorganism, and some of these phenazines possessed potent antibacterial activities. We found that a few of the synthesized 4-substituted phenazines could block the infectivity of chlamydiae without host cell toxicity.
The aim of this study was to design and synthesize two series of novel 3-substituted phenazines to find novel antichlamydial agents.
The 3-substituted phenazines were synthesized via Buchwald-Hartwig cross coupling reaction and Suzuki reaction from 3-bromo-1-methoxyphenazine. The antichlamydial activity of these synthesized compounds was evaluated by determining their effect on the yield of infectious progeny EBs. Cytotoxicity of these compounds on host cells was assessed by the treatment of uninfected HeLa cells using WST-1 method.
Most of the 3-substituted phenazines possessed potent antichlamydial activity with IC50 values from 0.15 to 12.08 μM against Chlamydia trachomatis L2, C. muridarum MoPn and C. pneumoniae AR39. Among them, 7d and 9a exhibited better antichlamydial activity with IC50 values from 0.20 to 1.01 μM while they have no apparent cytotoxicity to host cells. Biological assay disclosed that both 7d and 9a inhibited chlamydial infection by reducing elementary body infectivity and disturbing chlamydial growth during the whole chlamydial developmental cycle.
Our findings suggested that 3-substituted phenazine derivatives might be a promising class of therapeutic agents for chlamydial infections. More effective phenazines with low toxicity could be acquired through further chemical modification on C-3 position rather than C-4 position of phenazine.",10.2174/1573406415666190708145639,"[{'lastname': 'Bao', 'firstname': 'Xiaofeng', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, Nantong 226001, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Ziyi', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, Nantong 226001, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ni', 'firstname': 'Min', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, Nantong 226001, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xia', 'firstname': 'Chao', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, Nantong 226001, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Shunxin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, Nantong 226001, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Shengju', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong 226001, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, Nantong 226001, China.'}]"

33819308,Western-style diet impedes colonization and clearance of Citrobacter rodentium.,PLoS pathogens,"Western-style diet (WSD), which is high in fat and low in fiber, lacks nutrients to support gut microbiota. Consequently, WSD reduces microbiota density and promotes microbiota encroachment, potentially influencing colonization resistance, immune system readiness, and thus host defense against pathogenic bacteria. Here we examined the impact of WSD on infection and colitis in response to Citrobacter rodentium. We observed that, relative to mice consuming standard rodent grain-based chow (GBC), feeding WSD starkly altered the dynamics of Citrobacter infection, reducing initial colonization and inflammation but frequently resulting in persistent infection that associated with low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. WSD's reduction in initial Citrobacter virulence appeared to reflect that colons of GBC-fed mice contain microbiota metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, especially acetate, that drive Citrobacter growth and virulence. Citrobacter persistence in WSD-fed mice reflected inability of resident microbiota to out-compete it from the gut lumen, likely reflecting the profound impacts of WSD on microbiota composition. These studies demonstrate potential of altering microbiota and their metabolites by diet to impact the course and consequence of infection following exposure to a gut pathogen.",10.1371/journal.ppat.1009497,"[{'lastname': 'An', 'firstname': 'Junqing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Xu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.\nInstitute of Antibiotics, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yanling', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Noriega', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Gewirtz', 'firstname': 'Andrew T', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Zou', 'firstname': 'Jun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.'}]"
33811225,Inactivation of genes in oxidative respiration and iron acquisition pathways in pediatric clinical isolates of Small colony variant Enterobacteriaceae.,Scientific reports,"Isolation of bacterial small colony variants (SCVs) from clinical specimens is not uncommon and can fundamentally change the outcome of the associated infections. Bacterial SCVs often emerge with their normal colony phenotype (NCV) co-isolates in the same sample. The basis of SCV emergence in vivo is not well understood in Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we interrogated the causal genetic lesions of SCV growth in three pairs of NCV and SCV co-isolates of Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter hormaechei. We confirmed SCV emergence was attributed to limited genomic mutations: 4 single nucleotide variants in the E. coli SCV, 5 in C. freundii, and 8 in E. hormaechei. In addition, a 10.2 kb chromosomal segment containing 11 genes was deleted in the E. hormaechei SCV isolate. Each SCV had at least one coding change in a gene associated with bacterial oxidative respiration and another involved in iron capture. Chemical and genetic rescue confirmed defects in heme biosynthesis for E. coli and C. freundii and lipoic acid biosynthesis in E. hormaachei were responsible for the SCV phenotype. Prototrophic growth in all 3 SCV Enterobacteriaceae species was unaffected under anaerobic culture conditions in vitro, illustrating how SCVs may persist in vivo.",10.1038/s41598-021-86764-4,"[{'lastname': 'Greninger', 'firstname': 'Alexander L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.\nSeattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Addetia', 'firstname': 'Amin', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.\nSeattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Tao', 'firstname': 'Yue', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Translational Research Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Adler', 'firstname': 'Amanda', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Qin', 'firstname': 'Xuan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. qinxu@ohsu.edu.\nSeattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA. qinxu@ohsu.edu.""}]"

33836443,Selection and application of natural antimicrobials to control Clostridium perfringens in sous-vide chicken breasts inhibition of C. perfringens in sous-vide chicken.,International journal of food microbiology,"Current consumer preferences for both clean label food ingredients and convenience-based foods has provided a unique opportunity to explore the application of novel natural food preservatives in sous vide products. The anaerobic environment and relatively low thermal processing of the sous vide process creates a favorable environment for the survival, germination, and outgrowth of spore-forming bacterium Clostridium perfringens. The aim of this study was to identify effective novel natural ingredient formulations against C. perfringens and apply them within a vacuum-sealed sous vide chicken model exposed to abusive storage and chilling conditions. Among six commercial vinegar-based formulations, liquid vinegar with citrus extract (CE; 1.0%) and with lemon juice concentrate (LJC; 1.5%) were identified as the most effective at inhibiting three individual C. perfringens strains. Both reduced viable cell counts by 5 log CFU/mL (P < 0.05), whereas reductions in spore counts ranged from 2 to 4 log CFU/mL depending on formulation and concentration used. Once incorporated to chicken meat 1.0% CE and 1.5% LJC before sous-vide cooking, completely inhibited the growth of mixed C. perfringens strains (P < 0.05) during storage for 16 days at 12 and 16 °C. Exponential cooling from 54 to 4 °C was performed for 18 h to imitate abusive storage conditions. CE and LJC at 3.0% inhibited growth and reduced counts by 3.4 and 2.9 log CFU/g compared to respective controls. Treatments CE and LJC could be implemented within the formulation of a sous vide chicken product to provide an effective protection against C. perfringens meeting clean label expectations.",10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.109193,"[{'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Clayton J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Center for Food Safety, University of Georgia, 1109 Experiment Street, Griffin, GA 30223, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Olszewska', 'firstname': 'Magdalena A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Food Safety, University of Georgia, 1109 Experiment Street, Griffin, GA 30223, USA; Department of Industrial and Food Microbiology, Faculty of Food Science, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Plac Cieszyński 1, 10-726 Olsztyn, Poland.

In this study, wastewater metagenomes from 8 stages of CETP were screened for microbial diversity and gene profiling along with their corresponding degradation activities. The microbial community displayed 98.46% of bacterial species, followed by Eukarya (0.10%) and Archaea 0.02%. At the Phylum level, Proteobacteria (28.8%) was dominant, followed by Bacteroidetes (16.1%), Firmicutes (11.7%), and Fusobacteria (6.9%) which are mainly capable of degrading the aromatic compounds. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Wolinella succinogenes, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, and Clostridium sticklandii were the most prevalent species. The functional analysis further demonstrated the presence of enzymes linked with genes/pathways known to be involved in the degradation/metabolization of aromatic compounds like benzoate, bisphenol, 1,2-dichloroethane phenylalanine. This information was further validated with the whole genome analysis of the bacteria isolated from the CETP. We anticipate that integrating both shotgun and whole-genome analyses can reveal the rich reservoir for novel enzymes and genes present in CETP effluent that can contribute to designing efficient bioremediation strategies for the environment in general CETP system, in particular.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112448,"[{'lastname': 'Pandit', 'firstname': 'Priti Raj', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Raghawendra', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Dinesh', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Zarna', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Pandya', 'firstname': 'Labdhi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Manish', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Discipline of Earth Sciences, IIT Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382355, India.

33830299,Impact of Clostridium difficile infection on pediatric appendicitis.,Pediatric surgery international,"Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial infection in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study is to estimate the impact of Clostridium difficile infection complicating pediatric acute appendicitis.
This study utilizes the combined 2009 and 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database. Statistical analysis is weighted and was done using Survey Sampling and Analysis procedures in SAS 9.4.
We identified 176,934 cases with appendicitis and 0.2% (n = 358) had a concurrent diagnosis of C. difficile. The proportion of cases with C. difficile in perforated appendicitis was greater than in the non-perforated cases (0.39% vs. 0.06%; p < .01). Multivariate analysis showed that perforated appendicitis (OR 5.22), and anemia (OR 4.95) were independent predictors of C. difficile infection (p < .001). Adjusted for perforated appendicitis, cases with C. difficile had 4.78 days longer length of stay (LOS) and higher total charges of $29,887 (all p < 0.0001) compared to non-C. difficile cases.
C. difficile infection is a rare, but impactful complication of pediatric appendicitis and is associated with greater disease severity. Proper antibiotic stewardship could minimize the risk of C. difficile in pediatric appendicitis.","10.1007/s00383-021-04893-3

Fifty heifers calves were enrolled [38 Gyr (Zebu, Bos taurus indicus) and 12 5/8 Holstein x Gyr]. At 120 days of age, animals were randomly distributed among three groups: B (n = 18), vaccinated against brucellosis; C (n = 14), vaccinated against clostridia and CB (n = 18), vaccinated concomitantly for both. Rectal (RT) and thermographic temperatures were evaluated on days -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7,10, 14, and 28 relatives to the vaccination day. Feed and water intake, body weight (BW) and feeding behavior were monitored daily by an electronic feeding system. Blood was sampled on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28, relative to the vaccination day for determination of glucose (GLC) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations. Blood sampled on day 0 (pre-vaccination) and on day 28 and 42 were used to evaluate the immune response against Brucella abortus and clostridia. There was an increase in rectal temperature between the first and the third day post-vaccination in the three groups. The thermography revealed an increase of local temperature for seven days on groups B and CB. Group C had increased local temperature for a longer period, lasting for up to 14 d. Dry mater intake was reduced for groups B and CB, but no alteration was observed for group C. No alterations regarding initial BW, final BW, average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed efficiency were observed. No differences were observed for the three vaccination groups for blood parameters throughout the evaluation period. The concomitant vaccination against brucellosis and clostridia led to lower neutralizing antibody titers against epsilon toxin of C. perfringens and botulinum toxin type C of C. botulinum (C > CB > B). When cellular proliferation assay and serological tests to B. abortus were evaluated, no differences were observed between groups B and CB. The present results indicate that the concomitant vaccination against brucellosis and clostridia has no relevant impact on the intake, performance, and feeding behavior of dairy calves. However, the concomitant vaccination of vaccines against these two pathogens impacts animal immunity against clostridial infections.",10.1093/jas/skab107,"[{'lastname': 'Diniz Neto', 'firstname': 'H C', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Zootecnia, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lombardi', 'firstname': 'M C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Zootecnia, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Campos', 'firstname': 'M M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lage', 'firstname': 'A P', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Silveira Silva', 'firstname': 'R O', 'initials': 'RO', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Dorneles', 'firstname': 'E M S', 'initials': 'EMS', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Lavras, Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lage', 'firstname': 'C F A', 'initials': 'CFA', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Zootecnia, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Carvalho', 'firstname': 'W A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Machado', 'firstname': 'F S', 'initials': 'FS', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'L G R', 'initials': 'LGR', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Tomich', 'firstname': 'T R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramos', 'firstname': 'C P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Assis', 'firstname': 'R A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lobato', 'firstname': 'F C F', 'initials': 'FCF', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Santana', 'firstname': 'J A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Santos', 'firstname': 'E L S', 'initials': 'ELS', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Andrade', 'firstname': 'R S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Lavras, Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Coelho', 'firstname': 'S G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Zootecnia, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}]"
33794266,Management of excessive gingival display using botulinum toxin type A: a descriptive study.,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,"Botulinum toxin is a protease used by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum that causes chemical denervation of skeletal muscles, producing a temporary weakening of muscle activity. Despite having a transitory effect, the application of botulinum toxin has been identified as an alternative for correcting an excessive gingival display (EGD). However, studies evaluating the maintenance of long-term results of botulinum toxin remain scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and duration of botulinum toxin type A in the treatment of anterior EGD. Botulinum toxin Type A was applied to 15 patients with EGD. The measurement was performed in triplicate, using a Castro Viejo dry point compass, between the central cervical portion of the upper lateral incisors to the lower portion of the upper lip, bilaterally. The measurements were performed before the application of the toxin and repeated on days 7, 14, 90, 120, and 180 after the procedure. The data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by a Bonferroni. There was a statistically significant reduction between the measurements performed on the Baseline and seven days after the application of the botulinum toxin.

33836037,Faecalibacterium prausnitzii increases following fecal microbiota transplantation in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection.,PloS one,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). However, the fecal transplant's causal components translating into clearance of the CDI are yet to be identified. The commensal bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii may be of great interest in this context, since it is one of the most common species of the healthy gut microbiota and produces metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties. Although there is mounting evidence that F. prausnitzii is an important regulator of intestinal homeostasis, data about its role in CDI and FMT are relatively scarce.
Stool samples from patients with recurrent CDI were collected to investigate the relative abundance of F. prausnitzii before and after FMT. Twenty-one patients provided fecal samples before the FMT procedure, at 2 weeks post-FMT, and at 2-4 months post-FMT. The relative abundance of F. prausnitzii was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
The abundance of F. prausnitzii was elevated in samples (N = 9) from donors compared to pre-FMT samples (N = 15) from patients (adjusted P<0.001). No significant difference in the abundance of F. prausnitzii between responders (N = 11) and non-responders (N = 4) was found before FMT (P = 0.85). In patients with CDI, the abundance of F. prausnitzii significantly increased in the 2 weeks post-FMT samples (N = 14) compared to the pre-FMT samples (N = 15, adjusted P<0.001). The increase persisted 2-4 months post-FMT (N = 15) compared to pre-FMT samples (N = 15) (adjusted P<0.001).
FMT increases the relative abundance of F. prausnitzii in patients with recurrent CDI, and this microbial shift remains several months later. The baseline abundance of F. prausnitzii in donors or recipients was not associated with future treatment response, although a true predictive capacity cannot be excluded because of the limited sample size. Further studies are needed to discern whether F. prausnitzii plays an active role in the resolution of CDI.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249861,"[{'lastname': 'Björkqvist', 'firstname': 'Olle', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Faculty of Medicine and Health, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Rangel', 'firstname': 'Ignacio', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'School of Medical Sciences, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Serrander', 'firstname': 'Lena', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Magnusson', 'firstname': 'Cecilia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases, Region Jönköping County, Jönköping, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Halfvarson', 'firstname': 'Jonas', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Faculty of Medicine and Health, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.\nSchool of Medical Sciences, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Norén', 'firstname': 'Torbjörn', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Reference Laboratory for Clostridioides Difficile, Clinical Microbiology, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Bergman-Jungeström', 'firstname': 'Malin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Microbiology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.'}]"

33830299,Impact of Clostridium difficile infection on pediatric appendicitis.,Pediatric surgery international,"Clostridium difficile is an important cause of nosocomial infection in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study is to estimate the impact of Clostridium difficile infection complicating pediatric acute appendicitis.
This study utilizes the combined 2009 and 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database. Statistical analysis is weighted and was done using Survey Sampling and Analysis procedures in SAS 9.4.
We identified 176,934 cases with appendicitis and 0.2% (n = 358) had a concurrent diagnosis of C. difficile. The proportion of cases with C. difficile in perforated appendicitis was greater than in the non-perforated cases (0.39% vs. 0.06%; p < .01). Multivariate analysis showed that perforated appendicitis (OR 5.22), and anemia (OR 4.95) were independent predictors of C. difficile infection (p < .001). Adjusted for perforated appendicitis, cases with C. difficile had 4.78 days longer length of stay (LOS) and higher total charges of $29,887 (all p < 0.0001) compared to non-C. difficile cases.
C. difficile infection is a rare, but impactful complication of pediatric appendicitis and is associated with greater disease severity. Proper antibiotic stewardship could minimize the risk of C. difficile in pediatric appendicitis.","10.1007/s00383-021-04893-3

33830032,Clostridioides difficile Infection and Risk of Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease among Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Recipients.,Transplantation and cellular therapy,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of infectious diarrhea among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients. The relationship between CDI and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) has been a topic of interest, as these 2 conditions may influence each other. We studied the temporal relationship of CDI to aGVHD in the first 100 days post-transplantation in a large cohort of allo-HSCT recipients. We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult patients undergoing their first allo-HSCT at our tertiary care medical center between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2016. Patients were followed for CDI diagnosis, development of aGVHD, and vital status up to day +100 post-transplantation. Descriptive statistics and multivariate Cox models with CDI as a time-varying covariate and aGVHD and high-grade aGVHD as outcomes were used for data analyses. A total of 656 allo-HSCT recipients were included in the analysis. Of these, 419 (64%) developed aGVHD, and 111 (17%) were diagnosed with CDI within the first 100 days post-transplantation. CDI developed before the onset of aGVHD in 72 of the 84 allo-HSCT recipients (85%) with both CDI and aGVHD. Fidaxomicin was used in the treatment of 57 of the 111 CDI cases (50%), whereas vancomycin was used in 52 (47%). Most of the CDI cases (88%) were diagnosed in the peritransplantation period (between day -10 and day +10). The median time to the development of CDI and aGVHD was 3.5 days (range, -7 to 95 days) and 33 days (range, 9 to 98 days) post-transplantation, respectively. Using multivariate Cox model, the following predictors were significantly associated with the development of aGVHD: CDI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17 to 1.97; P = .0018), transplantation from a matched related donor (MRD) compared with a matched unrelated donor (aHR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.85; P = .0003), and myeloablative versus nonmyeloablative conditioning (aHR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.80 to 3.34; P < .0001), adjusting for age, sex, race, underlying disease, cytomegalovirus CMV serostatus, transplant source, and receipt of antithymocyte globulin (ATG). There was no association between CDI and high-grade aGVHD after adjustment for age, underlying disease, transplant type, intensity of conditioning, and receipt of ATG (aHR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.66; P = .0755). CDI after allo-HSCT is associated with increased risk of GVHD when no CDI prophylaxis was used. Further studies examining CDI preventive measures, including prophylaxis, as well as the preservation or reconstitution of the gastrointestinal microbiome in the setting of HSCT are warranted.",10.1016/j.jtct.2020.10.009,"[{'lastname': 'Jabr', 'firstname': ""Ra'ed"", 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.'}, {'lastname': 'El Atrouni', 'firstname': 'Wissam', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.'}, {'lastname': 'Shune', 'firstname': 'Leyla', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.'}, {'lastname': 'Telfah', 'firstname': 'Mohammad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Guangyi', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, Kansas.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Jianghua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics and Data Science, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, Kansas.'}, {'lastname': 'Abhyankar', 'firstname': 'Sunil', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.'}, {'lastname': 'McGuirk', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.'}, {'lastname': 'Clough', 'firstname': 'Lisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.

33836443,Selection and application of natural antimicrobials to control Clostridium perfringens in sous-vide chicken breasts inhibition of C. perfringens in sous-vide chicken.,International journal of food microbiology,"Current consumer preferences for both clean label food ingredients and convenience-based foods has provided a unique opportunity to explore the application of novel natural food preservatives in sous vide products. The anaerobic environment and relatively low thermal processing of the sous vide process creates a favorable environment for the survival, germination, and outgrowth of spore-forming bacterium Clostridium perfringens. The aim of this study was to identify effective novel natural ingredient formulations against C. perfringens and apply them within a vacuum-sealed sous vide chicken model exposed to abusive storage and chilling conditions. Among six commercial vinegar-based formulations, liquid vinegar with citrus extract (CE; 1.0%) and with lemon juice concentrate (LJC; 1.5%) were identified as the most effective at inhibiting three individual C. perfringens strains. Both reduced viable cell counts by 5 log CFU/mL (P < 0.05), whereas reductions in spore counts ranged from 2 to 4 log CFU/mL depending on formulation and concentration used. Once incorporated to chicken meat 1.0% CE and 1.5% LJC before sous-vide cooking, completely inhibited the growth of mixed C. perfringens strains (P < 0.05) during storage for 16 days at 12 and 16 °C. Exponential cooling from 54 to 4 °C was performed for 18 h to imitate abusive storage conditions. CE and LJC at 3.0% inhibited growth and reduced counts by 3.4 and 2.9 log CFU/g compared to respective controls. Treatments CE and LJC could be implemented within the formulation of a sous vide chicken product to provide an effective protection against C. perfringens meeting clean label expectations.",10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.109193,"[{'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Clayton J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Center for Food Safety, University of Georgia, 1109 Experiment Street, Griffin, GA 30223, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Olszewska', 'firstname': 'Magdalena A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Food Safety, University of Georgia, 1109 Experiment Street, Griffin, GA 30223, USA; Department of Industrial and Food Microbiology, Faculty of Food Science, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Plac Cieszyński 1, 10-726 Olsztyn, Poland.

Fifty heifers calves were enrolled [38 Gyr (Zebu, Bos taurus indicus) and 12 5/8 Holstein x Gyr]. At 120 days of age, animals were randomly distributed among three groups: B (n = 18), vaccinated against brucellosis; C (n = 14), vaccinated against clostridia and CB (n = 18), vaccinated concomitantly for both. Rectal (RT) and thermographic temperatures were evaluated on days -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7,10, 14, and 28 relatives to the vaccination day. Feed and water intake, body weight (BW) and feeding behavior were monitored daily by an electronic feeding system. Blood was sampled on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28, relative to the vaccination day for determination of glucose (GLC) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations. Blood sampled on day 0 (pre-vaccination) and on day 28 and 42 were used to evaluate the immune response against Brucella abortus and clostridia. There was an increase in rectal temperature between the first and the third day post-vaccination in the three groups. The thermography revealed an increase of local temperature for seven days on groups B and CB. Group C had increased local temperature for a longer period, lasting for up to 14 d. Dry mater intake was reduced for groups B and CB, but no alteration was observed for group C. No alterations regarding initial BW, final BW, average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed efficiency were observed. No differences were observed for the three vaccination groups for blood parameters throughout the evaluation period. The concomitant vaccination against brucellosis and clostridia led to lower neutralizing antibody titers against epsilon toxin of C. perfringens and botulinum toxin type C of C. botulinum (C > CB > B). When cellular proliferation assay and serological tests to B. abortus were evaluated, no differences were observed between groups B and CB. The present results indicate that the concomitant vaccination against brucellosis and clostridia has no relevant impact on the intake, performance, and feeding behavior of dairy calves. However, the concomitant vaccination of vaccines against these two pathogens impacts animal immunity against clostridial infections.",10.1093/jas/skab107,"[{'lastname': 'Diniz Neto', 'firstname': 'H C', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Zootecnia, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lombardi', 'firstname': 'M C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Zootecnia, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Campos', 'firstname': 'M M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lage', 'firstname': 'A P', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Silveira Silva', 'firstname': 'R O', 'initials': 'RO', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Dorneles', 'firstname': 'E M S', 'initials': 'EMS', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Lavras, Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lage', 'firstname': 'C F A', 'initials': 'CFA', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Zootecnia, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Carvalho', 'firstname': 'W A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Machado', 'firstname': 'F S', 'initials': 'FS', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'L G R', 'initials': 'LGR', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Tomich', 'firstname': 'T R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária - Embrapa Gado de Leite, Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramos', 'firstname': 'C P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Assis', 'firstname': 'R A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lobato', 'firstname': 'F C F', 'initials': 'FCF', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Santana', 'firstname': 'J A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Santos', 'firstname': 'E L S', 'initials': 'ELS', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Andrade', 'firstname': 'R S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Lavras, Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Coelho', 'firstname': 'S G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Zootecnia, Escola de Veterinária, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.'}]"
33818953,Evaluation and Comparison of Clostridium Epsilon-Alpha Fusion Gene Expression Using Different Commercial Expression Vector.,Archives of Razi Institute,"Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium septicum are gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming rods and pathogens for humans and livestock, which are widespread in nature as well as human and animal digestive systems. C. perfringens produces numerous different exoproteins, which are various systems of action. The major C. perfringens toxins include alpha, beta, epsilon, and iota. C. perfringens are classified into five groups (A-E) on the basis of the production of these lethal toxins. Furthermore, toxins secreted from C. septicum include alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. Epsilon and alpha toxins of C. perfringens and C. septicum are the major causes of enterotoxemia and braxy in sheep and goats, respectively. The production of recombinant immunogenic proteins of these bacteria using suitable expression vectors and expression prokaryotic hosts can be a convenient method for the reduction of the costs and production time of clostridial anaerobic vaccines. In the present study, recombinant Escherichia coli strain TOP10 containing pJET&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; was used for the evaluation of C. perfringens type D and C. septicum epsilon-alpha fusion protein using different commercial vectors. After the extraction of pJET&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; from the recombinant cell, it was digested by NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and subcloned into pET22b (+), pET26b (+), and pGEM-B1 expression vectors in E. coli/Rosetta and E. coli/BL21 (DE3). The expression of recombinant fusion toxin was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting in three different temperatures, various isopropyl &amp;beta;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) gradients, and different times using pGEM&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha;, pET22&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha;, and pET26&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; vectors in E. coli/Rosetta and E. coli/BL21 (DE3). According to the obtained results, recombinant E. coli/Rosetta/pET22&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; showed better expression at a temperature of 37&amp;deg;C after 6 h of induction by IPTG.",10.22092/ari.2019.126604.1349,"[{'lastname': 'Sepehrifar', 'firstname': 'H R', 'initials': 'HR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Karaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Pilehchian Langroudi', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Clostridia Specialized Research Laboratory, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran.\nClostridia Specialized Research Laboratory, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Ataei', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Avian Bacterial Diseases, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Haddadi', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Karaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran.'}]"

Different wound swabs were taken from 140 patients. PCR was applied for detection of clostridial toxins; alpha toxin (cpa) gene, epsilon toxin (etx) gene, and iota toxin (iap) gene. Metronidazole nim gene, tetracycline resistance genes; (tetQ, tetM, tetB, and tetW) and clindamycin resistance genes erm (A,B), were used for genotypic detection of antibiotic resistance.
Out of 140 clinical samples collected, 7 isolates were detected using specific primer 16S-23S intergenic rRNA spacer gene of C. perfringens. Results showed presence of alpha toxin (cpa) genes in all clostridial isolates, Epsilon toxin (etx) genes in 2/7(28.4%), and iota toxin (iap) genes in 2/7 (28.4%). Results of antibiotic resistance genes showed that all isolates were not able to produce nim, tet W and Q, tet B, erm (A), erm (B) genes except for tetM. Gene sequence analysis for cpa gene showed that there were 3 mutations in the sample of this gene, the results of etx gene when had been sent 2 samples from this gene. The first sample showed that there was one mutation and the results of iap gene showed that there were no mutation in 2 samples of the iap gene. The samples had been showed identical 100%.

33770235,Parvovirus B19 and mumps virus antibodies are major constituents of the intrathecal immune response in European patients with MS and increase the diagnostic sensitivity and discriminatory power of the MRZ reaction.,Journal of neurology,"A positive MRZ reaction, as defined by intrathecal IgG production against at least two of its constituents, measles virus (M), rubella virus (R) and varicella zoster virus (Z), is detectable in ~ 63% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is currently considered the laboratory marker with the highest specificity and positive likelihood ratio for MS. However, M, R and Z are only the most well-established constituents of a broader intrathecal humoral immune response in MS.
To identify additional anti-microbial antibodies inclusion of which in the classical MRZ panel may result in increased sensitivity without compromising the marker's high specificity for MS.
We determined the antibody indices (AIs) for 11 viral and bacterial agents (M, R, Z, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, mumps virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Clostridium tetani) in paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples from patients with MS and disease controls.
A positive 'classical' MRZ reaction was found in 17/26 (65.4%) MS patients. The five most frequently positive AIs among patients with MS were M (76.9%), Z (61.5%), R (57.7%), parvovirus B19 (42.3%), and mumps (28%). Addition of parvovirus B19 and mumps virus to the MRZ panel resulted in an increase in sensitivity in the MS group from 65.4% to 73.1%, with 22% of the initially MRZ-negative patients exhibiting a de novo-positive response. The extended MRZ panel ('MRZplus') distinguished sharply between MS (≥ 3 AIs in 90% of all positives) and controls (varying diagnoses, from migraine to vasculitis; 0-1 AIs; p < 0.000001). The highest median AI in the MS group was found for parvovirus B19 (3.97), followed by measles virus (2.79).
Inclusion of parvovirus B19 and mumps virus in the test panel resulted in an increase in the sensitivity and discriminatory power of MRZ. Our results provide a strong rational for prospective studies investigating the role of extended MRZ panels in the differential diagnosis of MS.","10.1007/s00415-021-10471-3

33629408,Tetanus and tetanus neurotoxin: From peripheral uptake to central nervous tissue targets.,Journal of neurochemistry,"Tetanus is a deadly but preventable disease caused by a protein neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. Spores of C. tetani may contaminate a necrotic wound and germinate into a vegetative bacterium that releases a toxin, termed tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT). TeNT enters the general circulation, binds to peripheral motor neurons and sensory neurons, and is transported retroaxonally to the spinal cord. It then enters inhibitory interneurons and blocks the release of glycine or GABA causing a spastic paralysis. This review attempts to correlate the metalloprotease activity of TeNT and its trafficking and localization into the vertebrate body to the nature and sequence of appearance of the symptoms of tetanus.",10.1111/jnc.15330,"[{'lastname': 'Megighian', 'firstname': 'Aram', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di scienze Biomediche, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy.\nPadova Neuroscience Center, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pirazzini', 'firstname': 'Marco', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di scienze Biomediche, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Fabris', 'firstname': 'Federico', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di scienze Biomediche, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rossetto', 'firstname': 'Ornella', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di scienze Biomediche, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy.\nIstituto CNR di Neuroscienze, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Montecucco', 'firstname': 'Cesare', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di scienze Biomediche, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy.\nIstituto CNR di Neuroscienze, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy.'}]"
33603121,Identification of a non-coding RNA and its putative involvement in the regulation of tetanus toxin synthesis in Clostridium tetani.,Scientific reports,"Clostridium tetani produces the tetanus toxin (TeNT), one of the most powerful bacterial toxins known to humankind and responsible for tetanus. The regulation of toxin expression is complex and involves the alternative sigma factor TetR as well as other regulators. Here, a transcriptional analysis of the TeNT-encoding large plasmid of C. tetani identified a putative non-coding small RNA (sRNA), located in close vicinity of the 3' untranslated region of the tent gene. A northern blot experiment could identify a respective sRNA with a size of approx. 140 nucleotides. Sequence analysis showed that the sRNA contains a 14-nucleotide region that is complementary to a 5' located region of tent. In order to investigate the function of the sRNA, we applied a RNA interference approach targeting the sRNA in two C. tetani wild-type strains; the constructed antisense C. tetani strains showed an approx. threefold increase in both extracellular and total TeNT production compared to the respective wild-type strains. In addition, recombinant C. tetani strains were constructed that contained tent-locus harboring plasmids with and without the sRNA. However, the introduction of the tent-locus without the sRNA in a C. tetani strain lacking the wild-type TeNT-encoding large plasmid resulted in a lower TeNT production compared to the same strain with recombinant tent-locus with the sRNA. This suggests that the expression or the effect of the sRNA is modulated by the C. tetani genetic background, notably that of the wild-type TeNT-encoding large plasmid. In addition, some recombinant strains exhibited modulated growth patterns, characterized by premature bacterial cell lysis. Taken together, our data indicate that the sRNA acts as a negative regulator of TeNT synthesis, with a possible impact on the growth of C. tetani. We hypothesize that the role of this sRNA is to limit toxin levels in the exponential growth phase in order to prevent premature bacterial lysis.",10.1038/s41598-021-83623-0,"[{'lastname': 'Brüggemann', 'firstname': 'Holger', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Chapeton-Montes', 'firstname': 'Diana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Bacterial Toxins, Institut Pasteur, 25 rue du Dr Roux, 75724, Paris Cedex15, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Plourde', 'firstname': 'Lucile', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Sanofi-Pasteur, Marcy l'Etoile, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Popoff', 'firstname': 'Michel R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Bacterial Toxins, Institut Pasteur, 25 rue du Dr Roux, 75724, Paris Cedex15, France. popoff2m@gmail.com.'}]"

33770235,Parvovirus B19 and mumps virus antibodies are major constituents of the intrathecal immune response in European patients with MS and increase the diagnostic sensitivity and discriminatory power of the MRZ reaction.,Journal of neurology,"A positive MRZ reaction, as defined by intrathecal IgG production against at least two of its constituents, measles virus (M), rubella virus (R) and varicella zoster virus (Z), is detectable in ~ 63% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is currently considered the laboratory marker with the highest specificity and positive likelihood ratio for MS. However, M, R and Z are only the most well-established constituents of a broader intrathecal humoral immune response in MS.
To identify additional anti-microbial antibodies inclusion of which in the classical MRZ panel may result in increased sensitivity without compromising the marker's high specificity for MS.
We determined the antibody indices (AIs) for 11 viral and bacterial agents (M, R, Z, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, mumps virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Clostridium tetani) in paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples from patients with MS and disease controls.
A positive 'classical' MRZ reaction was found in 17/26 (65.4%) MS patients. The five most frequently positive AIs among patients with MS were M (76.9%), Z (61.5%), R (57.7%), parvovirus B19 (42.3%), and mumps (28%). Addition of parvovirus B19 and mumps virus to the MRZ panel resulted in an increase in sensitivity in the MS group from 65.4% to 73.1%, with 22% of the initially MRZ-negative patients exhibiting a de novo-positive response. The extended MRZ panel ('MRZplus') distinguished sharply between MS (≥ 3 AIs in 90% of all positives) and controls (varying diagnoses, from migraine to vasculitis; 0-1 AIs; p < 0.000001). The highest median AI in the MS group was found for parvovirus B19 (3.97), followed by measles virus (2.79).
Inclusion of parvovirus B19 and mumps virus in the test panel resulted in an increase in the sensitivity and discriminatory power of MRZ. Our results provide a strong rational for prospective studies investigating the role of extended MRZ panels in the differential diagnosis of MS.","10.1007/s00415-021-10471-3

These hair-like structures, although very thin (1 to 5 nm), exhibit impressive tensile strengths because their protein components (pilins) are covalently crosslinked together via lysine-isopeptide bonds by pilus-specific sortase enzymes. While atomic structures of isolated pilins have been determined, how they are joined together by sortases and how these interpilin crosslinks stabilize pilus structure are poorly understood.

33830386,Efficient strategies to enhance plasmid stability for fermentation of recombinant Escherichia coli harboring tyrosine phenol lyase.,Biotechnology letters,"To solve the bottleneck of plasmid instability during microbial fermentation of L-DOPA with recombinant Escherichia coli expressing heterologous tyrosine phenol lyase.
The tyrosine phenol lyase from Fusobacterium nucleatum was constitutively expressed in E. coli and a fed-batch fermentation process with temperature down-shift cultivation was performed. Efficient strategies including replacing the original ampicillin resistance gene, as well as inserting cer site that is active for resolving plasmid multimers were applied. As a result, the plasmid stability was increased. The co-use of cer site on plasmid and kanamycin in culture medium resulted in proportion of plasmid containing cells maintained at 100% after fermentation for 35 h. The specific activity of tyrosine phenol lyase reached 1493 U/g dcw, while the volumetric activity increased from 2943 to 14,408 U/L for L-DOPA biosynthesis.
The established strategies for plasmid stability is not only promoted the applicability of the recombinant cells for L-DOPA production, but also provides important guidance for industrial fermentation with improved microbial productivity.","10.1007/s10529-021-03082-5

33823861,The dysbiosis signature of Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer-cause or consequences? A systematic review.,Cancer cell international,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer globally and the fourth attributable cause of mortality and morbidity due to cancer. An emerging factor contributing to CRC is the gut microbiota and the cellular changes associated with it. Further insights on this may help in the prevention, diagnosis and new therapeutic approaches to colorectal cancer. In most cases of CRC, genetic factors appear to contribute less to its aetiology than environmental and epigenetic factors; therefore, it may be important to investigate these environmental factors, their effects, and the mechanisms that may contribute to this cancer. The gut microbiota has recently been highlighted as a potential risk factor that may affect the structural components of the tumor microenvironment, as well as free radical and enzymatic metabolites directly, or indirectly. Many studies have reported changes in the gut microbiota of patients with colorectal cancer. What is controversial is whether the cancer is the cause or consequence of the change in the microbiota. There is strong evidence supporting both possibilities. The presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum in human colorectal specimens has been demonstrated by RNA-sequencing. F. nucleatum has been shown to express high levels of virulence factors such as FadA, Fap2 and MORN2 proteins. Our review of the published data suggest that F. nucleatum may be a prognostic biomarker of CRC risk, and hence raises the potential of antibiotic treatment of F. nucleatum for the prevention of CRC.","10.1186/s12935-021-01886-z

Respiratory diphtheria is a toxin-mediated disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Diphtheria-like illness, clinically indistinguishable from diphtheria, is caused by C. ulcerans, a zoonotic bacterium that can also produce diphtheria toxin. In the United States, respiratory diphtheria is nationally notifiable: specimens from suspected cases are submitted to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for species and toxin confirmation, and diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) is obtained from CDC for treatment. We summarize the epidemiology of respiratory diphtheria and diphtheria-like illness and describe DAT use during 1996-2018 in the United States.
We described respiratory diphtheria cases reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) and C. ulcerans-related diphtheria-like illness identified through specimen submissions to CDC during 1996-2018. We reviewed DAT requests from 1997-2018.
From 1996-2018, 14 respiratory diphtheria cases were reported to NNDSS. Among these 14 cases, 1 was toxigenic and 3 were non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae by culture and Elek, 6 were culture-negative but PCR-positive for diphtheria toxin gene, 1 was culture-positive without further testing, and the remaining 3 were either not tested or tested negative. Five cases of respiratory diphtheria-like illness caused by toxigenic C. ulcerans were identified. DAT was requested by healthcare providers for 151 suspected diphtheria cases between 1997-2018, with an average of 11 requests per year from 1997-2007, and 3 per year from 2008-2018.
Respiratory diphtheria remains rare in the United States, and requests for DAT have declined. Incidental identification of C. ulcerans-related diphtheria-like illness suggests surveillance of this condition might be warranted.",10.1093/cid/ciaa1218,"[{'lastname': 'Otshudiema', 'firstname': 'John O', 'initials': 'JO', 'affiliation': 'Epidemic Intelligence Service Program, Division of Scientific Education and Professional Development, Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.\nMeningitis and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Branch, Division of Bacterial Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Acosta', 'firstname': 'Anna M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Meningitis and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Branch, Division of Bacterial Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Cassiday', 'firstname': 'Pamela K', 'initials': 'PK', 'affiliation': 'Meningitis and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Branch, Division of Bacterial Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Hadler', 'firstname': 'Stephen C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Bacterial Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Hariri', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Meningitis and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Branch, Division of Bacterial Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Tiwari', 'firstname': 'Tejpratap S P', 'initials': 'TSP', 'affiliation': 'Meningitis and Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Branch, Division of Bacterial Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, United States.'}]"

33822974,Utilization of Standard Method Performance Requirements for the Detection of Coxiella burnetii in Environmental Samples.,Journal of AOAC International,"Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, is a long-standing public health problem. Infected animals shed the organism, resulting in aerosol transmission to humans. This organism can potentially be used as a bioterrorism weapon and is on the Department of Health and Human Service Select Agent List. Assay development for detecting C. burnetii in environmental samples has been limited.
We describe the use of Standard Method Performance Requirements (SMPR®) 2015.011 to detect Coxiella in air filters and liquids to validate additional environmental samples.
SMPR 2015.011 was used to validate a real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) assay developed to detect C. burnetii DNA in powder samples submitted to the public health laboratory for biothreat analysis.
Our laboratory developed an assay to detect the icd gene of C. burnetii. The LOD for the assay was 33 gene copies per rtPCR reaction in buffer and 260 in each of the three separate powdered samples.
The SMPR 2015.011 allowed validation of an assay to detect Coxiella nucleic acid in an environmental sample. The assay was sensitive, robust, specific, and able to detect this select agent in powders.
Development of detection assays for agents that are difficult to culture and have limited validation material available can be problematic for manufacturers. Using the SMPR 2015.011 developed for the detection of Coxiella as well as the SMPR 2016.012 for the detection of Variola, we demonstrated that assays can be appropriately validated using alternative approaches.",10.1093/jaoacint/qsaa101,"[{'lastname': 'Perry', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, 120 New Scotland Ave, Albany, NY 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Conlon', 'firstname': 'Maureen A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, 120 New Scotland Ave, Albany, NY 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Egan', 'firstname': 'Christina T', 'initials': 'CT', 'affiliation': 'Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, 120 New Scotland Ave, Albany, NY 12208, USA.'}]"

Serum samples were collected from pet dogs (n = 500) of the three most common breeds (German Shepherd, Rottweiler and Pit Bull) in five Governates of Cairo (n = 230), Giza (n = 110), Al-Qalyubia (n = 60), Al-Gharbia (n = 60) and Kafr El-Sheikh (n = 40) with a hot desert climate. The presence of antibodies to Anaplasma spp. (A. phagocytophilum, A. platys), Ehrlichia spp. (E. canis, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii), Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.) and Dirofilaria immitis were assessed using IDEXX SNAP
In total, 18.2% (n = 91, 95% CI 15.1-21.8) of dogs scored seropositive for at least one pathogen, the most frequent being Ehrlichia spp. (n = 56; 11.2%; 95% CI 8.7-14.3) followed by Anaplasma spp. (n = 33; 6.6%, 95% CI 4.7-9.1), Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.) (n = 9; 1.8%, 95% CI 0.9-3.4) and D. immitis (n = 7; 1.4%, 95% CI 0.9-2.9). In the tested population, 15.4% (95% CI 12.5-18.8) of dogs were exposed to a single pathogen while 2.4 (95% CI 1.4-4.2) and 0.4% (95% CI 0.1-1.4) were simultaneously exposed to two or three pathogens, respectively. Major risk factors associated with VBDs were living outdoors (Anaplasma spp., P = 0.0001; Ehrlichia spp., P = 0.0001), female sex (Ehrlichia spp., P = 0.005), German Shepherd breed (Anaplasma spp., P = 0.04; Ehrlichia spp., P = 0.03), tick infestation (Anaplasma spp., P = 0.0001; Ehrlichia spp., P = 0.0001; B. burgdorferi (s.l.), P = 0.003; D. immitis, P = 0.02), irregular sanitation (Anaplasma spp., P = 0.0001; Ehrlichia spp., P = 0.0001; B. burgdorferi (s.l.), P = 0.002; D. immitis, P = 0.01) and not using ectoparasiticides (Anaplasma spp., P = 0.0001; Ehrlichia spp., P = 0.0001; B. burgdorferi (s.l.), P = 0.007).

Due to predation behaviour, carnivorous birds may play an important role in spreading these etiological agentes across geographically distant areas, specially if they are migratory. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and to access the phylogenetic relations among Anaplasmataceae (Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Neorickettsia), Bartonellaceae (Bartonella spp.), and Haemosporida (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) agents in blood samples from 121 carnivorous birds sampled in the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Inclusions resembling hemoparasites were not observed in Giemsa-stained preparations. While three animals were seropositive for E. chaffeensis (3.41% [3/88]; 95% CI:1.17-9.55%), five showed antibodies to A. phagocytophilum (5.68% [5/88]; 95% CI: 2.45-12.62%).

33836064,Crystal structure and functional implication of a bacterial cyclic AMP-AMP-GMP synthetase.,Nucleic acids research,"Mammalian cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its homologue dinucleotide cyclase in Vibrio cholerae (VcDncV) produce cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) that participate in the defense against viral infection. Recently, scores of new cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases (CD-NTases) were discovered, which produce various CDNs and cyclic trinucleotides (CTNs) as second messengers. Here, we present the crystal structures of EcCdnD, a CD-NTase from Enterobacter cloacae that produces cyclic AMP-AMP-GMP, in its apo-form and in complex with ATP, ADP and AMPcPP, an ATP analogue. Despite the similar overall architecture, the protein shows significant structural variations from other CD-NTases. Adjacent to the donor substrate, another nucleotide is bound to the acceptor binding site by a non-productive mode. Isothermal titration calorimetry results also suggest the presence of two ATP binding sites. GTP alone does not bind to EcCdnD, which however binds to pppApG, a possible intermediate. The enzyme is active on ATP or a mixture of ATP and GTP, and the best metal cofactor is Mg2+. The conserved residues Asp69 and Asp71 are essential for catalysis, as indicated by the loss of activity in the mutants. Based on structural analysis and comparison with VcDncV and RNA polymerase, a tentative catalytic pathway for the CTN-producing EcCdnD is proposed.",10.1093/nar/gkab165,"[{'lastname': 'Ko', 'firstname': 'Tzu-Ping', 'initials': 'TP', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yu-Chuan', 'initials': 'YC', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsai', 'firstname': 'Chia-Ling', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Chia-Shin', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hou', 'firstname': 'Mei-Hui', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yeh', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.\nResearch Center for Cancer Biology, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.\nNew Drug Development Center, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}]"

Among Enterobacteriaceae, the most frequently detected carbapenemase-encoding gene was blaNDM-1 (81.5%), followed by blaOXA-232 (14.8%) and blaoxa-181(7.4%), in A. baumannii was blaOXA-24 (76%) and in P. aeruginosa, was blaIMP (25.3%), followed by blaGES and blaVIM (13.1% each).
Our study reports that NDM-1 is the most frequent carbapenemase-encoding gene in Mexico in Enterobacteriaceae with the circulation of the oxacillinase genes 181 and 232. KPC, in contrast to other countries in Latin America and the USA, is a rare occurrence. Additionally, a high circulation of ESBL blaCTX-M-15 exists in both E. coli and K. pneumoniae.",10.1371/journal.pone.0248614,"[{'lastname': 'Garza-González', 'firstname': 'Elvira', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Universitario Dr. José E.

33711073,Multidrug-resistant enterobacteria in newborn dairy calves in Germany.,PloS one,"We studied the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in dairy calves as part of a routine health check protocol. In addition, data regarding antimicrobial use (AMU), farm hygiene, and farm management were collected in order to identify possible risks for ESBL occurrence. Ten farms participated in the study with a median of 781 milking cows (319-1701). All calves investigated were younger than two weeks with an average age of 6.8 (±3.9) days. The farms were visited and samples were collected twice at an interval of 7-11 months. Faecal samples diluted 1:10, were plated onto BrillianceTM ESBL agar in duplicates. After 24 hours at 37°C, colonies were counted and total colony forming units (cfu)/ml calculated. Bacteria species were identified biochemically. ESBL-production was phenotypically confirmed using the MICRONAUT-S β-Lactamases system. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using VITEK® 2 technology. Phylotyping of E. coli isolates and screening for bla genes was performed by PCR. ESBL-producing enterobacteria were detected on all farms and 96.5% of calves investigated shed ESBL-positive bacteria. Of all ESBL-producing isolates, the majority were E. coli (92.9%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (2.0%). The majority of E. coli isolates was clearly assigned to phylogroup C (25.0%), followed by phylogroups A (15.2%) and E (14.1%). CTX-M group 1 was most frequently detected (80.4%). E. cloacae contained blaCTX-M and blaTEM or blaSHV. K. pneumoniae harboured blaSHV only. Besides resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins, the majority of isolates was also resistant to one or more antibiotic classes, with a high proportion being resistant against fluoroqinolones. 52.5% of isolates were further characterised as threefold multidrug resistant gram-negative bacteria (3MDR-GNB) according to the German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention. None of the isolates were 4MDR-GNB, i.e. none revealed carbapenem-resistance. Penicillins were the most frequently administered antibiotics to calves on most farms and were the predominant substance class at herd level on all farms. Overall, the number of calves treated prior to sampling was rather low (11.7%). Analyses of data regarding the farm management identified weaknesses in biosecurity and cleaning and disinfection. Besides beta-lactam antibiotics being the most commonly used antibiotics no other risk factors could be identified. In summary, the prevalence of ESBL-carriers in dairy calves was exceptionally high and should be motivation to develop strategies for the reduction of multidrug-resistant bacteria in farm animals.",10.1371/journal.pone.0248291,"[{'lastname': 'Waade', 'firstname': 'Jil', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Animal Hygiene and Veterinary Public Health, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Seibt', 'firstname': 'Uwe', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Pharmacology, Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Honscha', 'firstname': 'Walther', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Pharmacology, Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rachidi', 'firstname': 'Fanny', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Clinic for Ruminants and Swine, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Starke', 'firstname': 'Alexander', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Clinic for Ruminants and Swine, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Speck', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Animal Hygiene and Veterinary Public Health, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Truyen', 'firstname': 'Uwe', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Animal Hygiene and Veterinary Public Health, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.'}]"
33575791,"Etiology of early-onset neonatal sepsis and antibiotic resistance in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of the Congo.",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) ranks among the countries with the highest neonatal death rates (between 14 and 28‰). In the DRC, neonatal sepsis causes 15.6% of this mortality, but data on the bacterial etiology and associated drug susceptibility are lacking.
Hemocultures of 150 neonates with possible early onset neonatal sepsis (pEOS) were obtained at the Hôpital Provincial Général de Référence de Bukavu (HPGRB, Bukavu, DRC). The newborns with pEOS received an empirical first-line antimicrobial treatment (ampicillin, cefotaxime and gentamicin), based on the synopsis of international guidelines for the management of EOS which are in line with WHO recommendations. Isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrophotometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Antibiotic resistance was assessed using the disk diffusion method.
A total of 50 strains was obtained from 48 patients and identified. The three most prevalent species were Enterobacter cloacae complex (42%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%) and Serratia marcescens (12%). Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to all first-line antibiotics. All K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens isolates were resistant to ampicillin, and the majority of the K. pneumoniae and half of the S. marcescens isolates were resistant to both cefotaxime and gentamicin. All E. cloacae complex strains, 89% of the K. pneumoniae and half of S. marcescens had an extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype.
The most prevalent pathogens causing EOS in Bukavu were E. cloacae complex, K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens.

This study aims to investigate the antimicrobial effects of biochar whose beneficial effects on agricultural productivity has been proven by different studies. Scientific literature concerning the antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral effects of the apricot seed and olive seed biochar is limited. Biochar applications may help to alter the microbial diversity by modifying biological environment either in agriculture or in animal husbandry. Moreover, biochar has been used in animal husbandry to improve animal health especially by regulating the intestinal flora and inflammation in the intestines. Hence, in our study, we investigated the effect of biochar on the growth of Aspergillus niger, Cryphonectria parasitica, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Plenodomus tracheiphilus, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and two different bacteriophage strains.

Association between PPIs and alteration of the gut microbiota has been reported. Blastocystis, the most common intestinal protozoan worldwide, occurs in both healthy and symptomatic people with gastrointestinal or cutaneous disorders, with controversial pathogenicity. The current study was aimed to investigate the influence of PPIs and H2 blockers on the in vitro proliferation of selected intestinal bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.
Cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Candida albicans, and Blastocystis subtype 3 were treated with different concentrations of respective medications in vitro, and the numbers of microorganisms were quantified and compared.
Pantoprazole and esomeprazole exerted a significant inhibition on Blastocystis and C. albicans, especially at higher concentrations, which were even more effective than metronidazole. On the other hand, treatment with pantoprazole caused an increase in proliferation of L. rhamnosus and E. coli. There was no influence of H2 blockers on the examined microorganisms.
PPIs, such as pantoprazole, can be a potential treatment in the prophylaxis or eradication of Blastocystis and C. albicans.",10.14309/ctg.0000000000000325,"[{'lastname': 'Lepczyńska', 'firstname': 'Małgorzata', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dzika', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'WenChieh', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Chien-Yu', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}]"

33831063,"ddcP, pstB, and excess D-lactate impact synergism between vancomycin and chlorhexidine against Enterococcus faecium 1,231,410.",PloS one,"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are important nosocomial pathogens that cause life-threatening infections. To control hospital-associated infections, skin antisepsis and bathing utilizing chlorhexidine is recommended for VRE patients in acute care hospitals. Previously, we reported that exposure to inhibitory chlorhexidine levels induced the expression of vancomycin resistance genes in VanA-type Enterococcus faecium. However, vancomycin susceptibility actually increased for VanA-type E. faecium in the presence of chlorhexidine. Hence, a synergistic effect of the two antimicrobials was observed. In this study, we used multiple approaches to investigate the mechanism of synergism between chlorhexidine and vancomycin in the VanA-type VRE strain E. faecium 1,231,410. We generated clean deletions of 7 of 11 pbp, transpeptidase, and carboxypeptidase genes in this strain (ponA, pbpF, pbpZ, pbpA, ddcP, ldtfm, and vanY). Deletion of ddcP, encoding a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase, altered the synergism phenotype. Furthermore, using in vitro evolution, we isolated a spontaneous synergy escaper mutant and utilized whole genome sequencing to determine that a mutation in pstB, encoding an ATPase of phosphate-specific transporters, also altered synergism. Finally, addition of excess D-lactate, but not D-alanine, enhanced synergism to reduce vancomycin MIC levels.

33830615,"Temperature Regulation of Membrane Composition in the Firmicute, Enterococcus faecalis, Parallels That of Escherichia coli.",Environmental microbiology,"Both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli can undergo abrupt temperature transitions in nature. E. coli changes the composition of its phospholipid acyl chains in response to shifts growth temperature. This is mediated by a naturally temperature sensitive enzyme, FabF (3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase II), that elongates the 16 carbon unsaturated acyl chain palmitoleate to the 18 carbon unsaturated acyl chain, cis-vaccenate. FabF is more active at low temperatures resulting in increased incorporation of cis-vaccenoyl acyl chains into the membrane phospholipids. This response to temperature is an intrinsic property of FabF and does not require increased synthesis of the enzyme. We report that the FabF of the very divergent bacterium, E. faecalis, has properties very similar to E. coli FabF and is responsible for changing E. faecalis membrane phospholipid acyl chain composition in response to temperature. Moreover, expression E. faecalis FabF in an E. coli ∆fabF strain restores temperature regulation to the E. coli strain. This article is protected by copyright.

We report a case of hepatic infarction, abscess, and death following gastroenteritis in a 63-year-old Aboriginal man who initially presented to a rural hospital with suspected food poisoning. The patient had persistent fever and was commenced on empirical antibiotics. His blood culture results were positive for Clostridium perfringens and Enterococcus avium. He was transferred to a tertiary center but developed organ failure and refractory shock. Initial computed tomography of the abdomen was unremarkable, but repeat imaging showed small bowel enteritis, hepatic abscess, and infarction as a result of portal vein septic thromboembolism. Despite maximal intensive care treatment, including percutaneous drainage of hepatic abscess and broad antibiotic cover, the patient died 6 days after initial presentation.
This case highlights the rare but commonly fatal course of sepsis associated with Clostridium perfringens bacteremia and demonstrates detrimental effects of coinfection with Enterococcus avium, including potential for rapidly seeding abscess formation.

Co-morbid conditions and procedures associated with VRE infection were identified by multivariable conditional logistic regression. Patient case-mix adjusted outcomes including in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and hospitalization cost were evaluated by high-dimensional propensity score adjustment.
During the seven-year study period and among 1,161,335 hospitalized patients within the MHS, we identified 577 (0.05%) patients with VRE infection. A majority of VRE infections were urinary tract infections (57.7%), followed by bloodstream (24.7%), other site/device-related (12.9%), respiratory (2.9%), and wound infections (1.8%). Risk factors for VRE infection included invasive gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and urologic procedures, indwelling devices, and exposure to 4th generation cephalosporins, but not to glycopeptides. Patients hospitalized with VRE infection had significantly higher hospitalization costs (attributable difference [AD] $135,534, P<0.001), prolonged hospital stays (AD 20.44 days, P<0.001, and higher in-hospital mortality (case-mix adjusted odds ratio 5.77; 95% confidence interval 4.59-7.25).
VRE infections carry a considerable burden for hospitalized patients given their impact on length of stay, hospitalization costs, and in-hospital mortality. Active surveillance and infection control efforts should target those identified as high-risk for VRE infection. Antimicrobial stewardship programs should focus on limiting exposure to 4th generation cephalosporins.",10.1093/milmed/usaa229,"[{'lastname': 'Stagliano', 'firstname': 'David R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Susi', 'firstname': 'Apryl', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Adams', 'firstname': 'Daniel J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA 23708, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nylund', 'firstname': 'Cade M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.'}]"

To control hospital-associated infections, skin antisepsis and bathing utilizing chlorhexidine is recommended for VRE patients in acute care hospitals. Previously, we reported that exposure to inhibitory chlorhexidine levels induced the expression of vancomycin resistance genes in VanA-type Enterococcus faecium. However, vancomycin susceptibility actually increased for VanA-type E. faecium in the presence of chlorhexidine. Hence, a synergistic effect of the two antimicrobials was observed. In this study, we used multiple approaches to investigate the mechanism of synergism between chlorhexidine and vancomycin in the VanA-type VRE strain E. faecium 1,231,410. We generated clean deletions of 7 of 11 pbp, transpeptidase, and carboxypeptidase genes in this strain (ponA, pbpF, pbpZ, pbpA, ddcP, ldtfm, and vanY). Deletion of ddcP, encoding a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase, altered the synergism phenotype. Furthermore, using in vitro evolution, we isolated a spontaneous synergy escaper mutant and utilized whole genome sequencing to determine that a mutation in pstB, encoding an ATPase of phosphate-specific transporters, also altered synergism. Finally, addition of excess D-lactate, but not D-alanine, enhanced synergism to reduce vancomycin MIC levels.

This study aimed to explore whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based approaches in epidemiological typing of VRE by investigating a collection of ST80 strains.
In total, 41 VRE ST80 isolates in three suspected transmission chains were subjected to WGS. The genetic relationship of the isolates was analysed by core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based typing. The published genome sequence of a predominant ST80 clone in Copenhagen was also included in the analyses.
Group 1 isolates (n = 10) were recovered in the same geographic area, including two isolates from an outbreak of vanA genotype. Group 2 isolates (n = 4) were detected from another outbreak. Group 3 consisted of 3 non-outbreak isolates and 24 representative isolates from an outbreak of vanB genotype. Our findings indicated ≥24 allelic difference and >16 SNPs as the cut-off for excluding VRE strains from an outbreak. cgMLST identified >200 differing alleles between genomes of the Copenhagen clone and outbreak strains in this study. Our findings also demonstrated that SNP analysis was not suitable for typing samples from different groups, even with the same ST, owing to lack of an optimal reference genome.
cgMLST and SNPs provided comparable epidemiological discrimination for isolates with a suspected transmission chain. For diverse isolates, SNP analysis could be suboptimal. An approach applying cgMLST as the first-line typing method and SNPs as a complementary tool is suggested.",10.1016/j.jgar.2021.03.005,"[{'lastname': 'Dyrkell', 'firstname': 'Fredrik', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': '1928 Diagnostics, Stena Center 1D, SE-412 92 Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Giske', 'firstname': 'Christian G', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Fang', 'firstname': 'Hong', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.

33743726,Intestinal carriage of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. among high-risk patients in university hospitals in Serbia: first surveillance report.,Annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials,"The screening for intestinal carriage of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE) among high risk patients in the Balkan region and molecular epidemiology of VRE is insufficiently investigated, yet it could be of key importance in infection control. The aim of this study was to provide baseline data on VRE intestinal carriage among high-risk patients in Serbian university hospitals, to determine the phenotypic/genotypic profiles of the isolated VRE, to obtain knowledge of local resistance patterns and bridge the gaps in current VRE surveillance.
The VRE reservoir was investigated using stool samples from 268 inpatients. Characterization of isolated VRE stains consisted of BD Phoenix system, genotypic identification, glycopeptide and quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D) resistance probing, virulence gene (esp, hyl, efaA, asa1, gelE, cpd) detection and MLVA. Biofilm formation was evaluated by the microtiter plate method.
VRE carriage prevalence among at-risk patients was 28.7%. All VRE strains were vanA positive multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRfm), harboring ermB-1 (38.9%), esp (84%), efaA (71.2%), hyl (54.5%), asa1 (23.4%), gelE and cpd (11.6%) each. Ability of biofilm production was detected in 20.8%. Genetic relatedness of the isolates revealed 13 clusters, heterogeneous picture and 25 unique MTs profiles.
The obtained prevalence of VRE intestinal carriage among high-risk inpatients in Serbia is higher than the European average, with high percentage of multidrug resistance. The emergence of resistance to Q-D is of particular concern.

Blastocystis, the most common intestinal protozoan worldwide, occurs in both healthy and symptomatic people with gastrointestinal or cutaneous disorders, with controversial pathogenicity. The current study was aimed to investigate the influence of PPIs and H2 blockers on the in vitro proliferation of selected intestinal bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.
Cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Candida albicans, and Blastocystis subtype 3 were treated with different concentrations of respective medications in vitro, and the numbers of microorganisms were quantified and compared.
Pantoprazole and esomeprazole exerted a significant inhibition on Blastocystis and C. albicans, especially at higher concentrations, which were even more effective than metronidazole. On the other hand, treatment with pantoprazole caused an increase in proliferation of L. rhamnosus and E. coli. There was no influence of H2 blockers on the examined microorganisms.

33830615,"Temperature Regulation of Membrane Composition in the Firmicute, Enterococcus faecalis, Parallels That of Escherichia coli.",Environmental microbiology,"Both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli can undergo abrupt temperature transitions in nature. E. coli changes the composition of its phospholipid acyl chains in response to shifts growth temperature. This is mediated by a naturally temperature sensitive enzyme, FabF (3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase II), that elongates the 16 carbon unsaturated acyl chain palmitoleate to the 18 carbon unsaturated acyl chain, cis-vaccenate. FabF is more active at low temperatures resulting in increased incorporation of cis-vaccenoyl acyl chains into the membrane phospholipids. This response to temperature is an intrinsic property of FabF and does not require increased synthesis of the enzyme. We report that the FabF of the very divergent bacterium, E. faecalis, has properties very similar to E. coli FabF and is responsible for changing E. faecalis membrane phospholipid acyl chain composition in response to temperature.

However, even such advanced treatment may be ineffective. The reasons for this are sought, inter alia, in the human microbiome. In our intestines, there are bacteria that are beneficial to us, but pathogenic microorganisms may also be present. Microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) is now perceived as one of the gateways to cancer. However, it is feasible to use bacteria and their metabolites to restore the natural, beneficial microbiome during oncological treatment. Akkermansia mucinifila, Enterococcus hirae, or Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are bacteria that exhibit this beneficial potential. Greater benefits of therapy can be observed in cancer patients enriched in these bacterial species and treated with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies. In this review, we present issues related to the role of bacteria in carcinogenesis and their therapeutic potential ""supporting"" modern anti-cancer therapies.Key Points• Bacteria can be directly or indirectly a cancer trigger.• Bacterial metabolites regulate the pathways associated with carcinogenesis.• Intestinal bacteria activate the immune system to fight cancer.","10.1007/s00253-021-11125-0

In this article, we report the first case of urinary tract infection-related bacteremia due to E. hirae from Turkey.
A 74-year-old male patient with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic renal failure was admitted to the emergency department with abdominal pain, dysuria, and fever. The urine sample collected from the urinary catheter resulted as ampicillin-sensitive E. hirae. On the 4th day of hospitalization, E. hirae growth with the same sensitivity pattern was also reported in blood culture. Intravenous ampicillin 4×2 g/day treatment was initiated. There was no growth in subsequent blood and urine cultures. Fever resolved and general condition improved. The patient was discharged on the thirteenth day with clinical improvement after moxifloxacin treatment for four days and ampicillin treatment for nine days.
The patient's medical history included risk factors for enterococcal bacteremia. There are a limited number of reports in the literature describing human infections caused by E. hirae. The reason for the rare isolation of E. hirae from clinical specimens may be the difficulty of identifying with standard diagnostic approaches.
For diagnostic purposes, as in our case, rapid and high sensitive diagnostic methods such as Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) and molecular techniques may be useful to guide the selection of the least toxic and optimal duration of antibiotic treatment.",10.3855/jidc.12522,"[{'lastname': 'Bilek', 'firstname': 'Heval Can', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey. hevalcan.bilek@omu.edu.tr.'}, {'lastname': 'Deveci', 'firstname': 'Aydın', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey. adeveci@omu.edu.tr.'}, {'lastname': 'Ünal', 'firstname': 'Sema', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey. semaunal25@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanrıverdi Çaycı', 'firstname': 'Yeliz', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey. yeliztanriverdi@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanyel', 'firstname': 'Esra', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey. etanyel@omu.edu.tr.'}]"

This study aims to investigate the antimicrobial effects of biochar whose beneficial effects on agricultural productivity has been proven by different studies. Scientific literature concerning the antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral effects of the apricot seed and olive seed biochar is limited. Biochar applications may help to alter the microbial diversity by modifying biological environment either in agriculture or in animal husbandry. Moreover, biochar has been used in animal husbandry to improve animal health especially by regulating the intestinal flora and inflammation in the intestines. Hence, in our study, we investigated the effect of biochar on the growth of Aspergillus niger, Cryphonectria parasitica, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Plenodomus tracheiphilus, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and two different bacteriophage strains. Biochar did not have a direct effect on the growth of neither Gram positive nor Gram negative bacteria, bacteriophages and fungi.

33835078,Influence of Proton Pump Inhibitors and Histamine Receptor 2 Antagonists on Blastocystis ST3 and Selected Microorganisms of Intestinal Microbiota In Vitro.,Clinical and translational gastroenterology,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine receptor 2 (H2) antagonists are commonly prescribed medications. Association between PPIs and alteration of the gut microbiota has been reported. Blastocystis, the most common intestinal protozoan worldwide, occurs in both healthy and symptomatic people with gastrointestinal or cutaneous disorders, with controversial pathogenicity. The current study was aimed to investigate the influence of PPIs and H2 blockers on the in vitro proliferation of selected intestinal bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.
Cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Candida albicans, and Blastocystis subtype 3 were treated with different concentrations of respective medications in vitro, and the numbers of microorganisms were quantified and compared.
Pantoprazole and esomeprazole exerted a significant inhibition on Blastocystis and C. albicans, especially at higher concentrations, which were even more effective than metronidazole. On the other hand, treatment with pantoprazole caused an increase in proliferation of L. rhamnosus and E. coli. There was no influence of H2 blockers on the examined microorganisms.
PPIs, such as pantoprazole, can be a potential treatment in the prophylaxis or eradication of Blastocystis and C. albicans.",10.14309/ctg.0000000000000325,"[{'lastname': 'Lepczyńska', 'firstname': 'Małgorzata', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dzika', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'WenChieh', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Chien-Yu', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}]"

33831063,"ddcP, pstB, and excess D-lactate impact synergism between vancomycin and chlorhexidine against Enterococcus faecium 1,231,410.",PloS one,"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are important nosocomial pathogens that cause life-threatening infections. To control hospital-associated infections, skin antisepsis and bathing utilizing chlorhexidine is recommended for VRE patients in acute care hospitals. Previously, we reported that exposure to inhibitory chlorhexidine levels induced the expression of vancomycin resistance genes in VanA-type Enterococcus faecium. However, vancomycin susceptibility actually increased for VanA-type E. faecium in the presence of chlorhexidine. Hence, a synergistic effect of the two antimicrobials was observed. In this study, we used multiple approaches to investigate the mechanism of synergism between chlorhexidine and vancomycin in the VanA-type VRE strain E. faecium 1,231,410. We generated clean deletions of 7 of 11 pbp, transpeptidase, and carboxypeptidase genes in this strain (ponA, pbpF, pbpZ, pbpA, ddcP, ldtfm, and vanY). Deletion of ddcP, encoding a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase, altered the synergism phenotype. Furthermore, using in vitro evolution, we isolated a spontaneous synergy escaper mutant and utilized whole genome sequencing to determine that a mutation in pstB, encoding an ATPase of phosphate-specific transporters, also altered synergism. Finally, addition of excess D-lactate, but not D-alanine, enhanced synergism to reduce vancomycin MIC levels. Overall, our work identified factors that alter chlorhexidine and vancomycin synergism in a model VanA-type VRE strain.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249631,"[{'lastname': 'Bhardwaj', 'firstname': 'Pooja', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Islam', 'firstname': 'Moutusee Z', 'initials': 'MZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Christi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Uyen Thy', 'initials': 'UT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Palmer', 'firstname': 'Kelli L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}]"
33830615,"Temperature Regulation of Membrane Composition in the Firmicute, Enterococcus faecalis, Parallels That of Escherichia coli.",Environmental microbiology,"Both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli can undergo abrupt temperature transitions in nature. E. coli changes the composition of its phospholipid acyl chains in response to shifts growth temperature. This is mediated by a naturally temperature sensitive enzyme, FabF (3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase II), that elongates the 16 carbon unsaturated acyl chain palmitoleate to the 18 carbon unsaturated acyl chain, cis-vaccenate. FabF is more active at low temperatures resulting in increased incorporation of cis-vaccenoyl acyl chains into the membrane phospholipids. This response to temperature is an intrinsic property of FabF and does not require increased synthesis of the enzyme. We report that the FabF of the very divergent bacterium, E. faecalis, has properties very similar to E. coli FabF and is responsible for changing E. faecalis membrane phospholipid acyl chain composition in response to temperature. Moreover, expression E. faecalis FabF in an E. coli ∆fabF strain restores temperature regulation to the E. coli strain. This article is protected by copyright.

33828158,Discovery of uncompetitive inhibitors of SapM that compromise intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,Scientific reports,"SapM is a secreted virulence factor from Mycobacterium tuberculosis critical for pathogen survival and persistence inside the host. Its full potential as a target for tuberculosis treatment has not yet been exploited because of the lack of potent inhibitors available. By screening over 1500 small molecules, we have identified new potent and selective inhibitors of SapM with an uncompetitive mechanism of inhibition. The best inhibitors share a trihydroxy-benzene moiety essential for activity. Importantly, the inhibitors significantly reduce mycobacterial burden in infected human macrophages at 1 µM, and they are selective with respect to other mycobacterial and human phosphatases. The best inhibitor also reduces intracellular burden of Francisella tularensis, which secretes the virulence factor AcpA, a homologue of SapM, with the same mechanism of catalysis and inhibition. Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of SapM with small molecule inhibitors is efficient in reducing intracellular mycobacterial survival in host macrophages and confirm SapM as a potential therapeutic target. These initial compounds have favourable physico-chemical properties and provide a basis for exploration towards the development of new tuberculosis treatments. The efficacy of a SapM inhibitor in reducing Francisella tularensis intracellular burden suggests the potential for developing broad-spectrum antivirulence agents to treat microbial infections.","10.1038/s41598-021-87117-x

33822142,"SENTINEL COYOTE PATHOGEN SURVEY TO ASSESS DECLINING BLACK-FOOTED FERRET (MUSTELA NIGRIPES) POPULATION IN SOUTH DAKOTA, USA.",Journal of wildlife diseases,"As part of the national recovery effort, endangered black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) were reintroduced to the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, US in 2000. Despite an encouraging start, numbers of ferrets at the site have declined. In an effort to determine possible causes of the population decline, we undertook a pathogen survey in 2012 to detect exposure to West Nile virus (WNV), canine distemper virus (CDV), plague (Yersinia pestis), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) using coyotes (Canis latrans) as a sentinel animal. The highest seroprevalence was for WNV with 71% (20/28) of coyotes testing antibody-positive. Seroprevalence of CDV and plague were lower, 27% and 13%, respectively. No evidence of active infection with tularemia or heartworm was seen in the coyotes sampled. As this study did not sample black-footed ferrets themselves, the definitive cause for the decline of this population cannot be determined. However, the presence of coyotes seropositive for two diseases, plague and CDV, lethal to black-footed ferrets, indicated the potential for exposure and infection. The high seroprevalence of WNV in the coyotes indicated a wide exposure to the virus; therefore, exposure of black-footed ferrets to the virus is also likely. Due to the ability of WNV to cause fatal disease in other species, studies may be useful to elucidate the impact that WNV could have on the success of reintroduced black-footed ferrets as well as factors influencing the spread and incidence of the disease in a prairie ecosystem.",10.7589/JWD-D-20-00015,"[{'lastname': 'Schuler', 'firstname': 'Krysten', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Claymore', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Prairie Management Program, PO Box 590, Eagle Butte, South Dakota 57625, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schnitzler', 'firstname': 'Hannah', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dubovi', 'firstname': 'Edward', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Cornell University, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rocke', 'firstname': 'Tonie', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, 6006 Schroeder Rd., Madison, Wisconsin 53711, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Perry', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center Biodefense Laboratory, 120 New Scotland Ave., Albany, New York 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bowman', 'firstname': 'Dwight', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, C4 119 Veterinary Medical Center, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abbott', 'firstname': 'Rachel C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, 6006 Schroeder Rd., Madison, Wisconsin 53711, USA.'}]"
33795957,Central Nervous System Vasculitis Due to an Endemic Zoonosis in Turkey; Tularemia.,Noro psikiyatri arsivi,"Tularemia is a bacterial zoonotic disease. The etiologic agent is francisella tularensis which is a gram negative coccobacillus. It is also an epidemic disease in some parts of Turkey. Clinical forms are ulceroglandular or glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, respiratory, and typhoidal forms. Neurological involvement is rare. It is usually presented with meningitis and encephalitis in literature. Our 42-year-old patient was suspected for demyelinating disease, ischemic cerebrovascular disease and vasculitis because of acute onset of neurological symptoms. She was diagnosed as tularemia during the investigation of her lymphadenitis. No etiologic risk factor was found for cerebrovascular disease, and demyelinating disease was excluded. Digital substraction angiography revealed the narrowing of the cerebral vessels. The lesions were partially regressed with the treatment. However, a new infarction developed with the interruption of treatment. All these findings suggested the diagnosis of central nervous system vasculitis due to francisella tularensis infection. Our case was important as it was the first vasculitic case due to tularemia in the literature.",10.29399/npa.23491,"[{'lastname': 'Çoban', 'firstname': 'Eda', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Bakırköy Education and Trainining Hospital of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 3rd Neurology Department,İstanbul,Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Serindağ', 'firstname': 'Helin Cansu', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Bakırköy Education and Trainining Hospital of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 3rd Neurology Department,İstanbul,Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Kara', 'firstname': 'Eda Salİhoğlu', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'Bakırköy Education and Trainining Hospital of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, Infection Department, İstanbul,Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Selçuk', 'firstname': 'Hatem Hakan', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Bakırköy Education and Trainining Hospital, Neuroradyology Department, İstanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Eren', 'firstname': 'Fulya', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Bakırköy Education and Trainining Hospital of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 3rd Neurology Department,İstanbul,Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Albay', 'firstname': 'Vasfiye Burcu', 'initials': 'VB', 'affiliation': 'Bakırköy Education and Trainining Hospital of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 3rd Neurology Department,İstanbul,Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Soysal', 'firstname': 'Aysun', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Bakırköy Education and Trainining Hospital of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 3rd Neurology Department,İstanbul,Turkey.'}]"

33789598,Francisella tularensis human infections in a village of northwest Iran.,BMC infectious diseases,"Recent seroepidemiological studies have suggested that tularemia could be an endemic bacterial zoonosis in Iran.
From January 2016 to June 2018, disease cases characterized by fever, cervical lymphadenopathy and ocular involvement were reported in Youzband Village of Kaleybar County, in the East Azerbaijan Province, northwestern Iran. Diagnostic tests included Francisella tularensis serology (including tube agglutination test and ELISA), PCR, and culture.
Among 11 examined case-patients, the tularemia tube agglutination test was positive in ten and borderline in one. PCR detected the F. tularensis ISFtu2 elements and fopA gene in one rodent and a spring water sample from the same geographic area.
Based on the clinical manifestations of the disease suggesting an oropharyngeal form of tularemia, serology results in case patients, and F. tularensis detection in the local fauna and aquatic environment, the water supply of the village was the likely source of the tularemia outbreak. Intervention such as dredging and chlorination of the main water storage tank of the village and training of villagers and health care workers in preventive measures and treatment of the illness helped control the infection.",10.1186/s12879-021-06004-y,"[{'lastname': 'Esmaeili', 'firstname': 'Saber', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Reference laboratory for Plague, Tularemia and Q fever, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Akanlu, Kabudar Ahang, Hamadan, Iran.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Rohani', 'firstname': 'Mahdi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'National Reference laboratory for Plague, Tularemia and Q fever, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Akanlu, Kabudar Ahang, Hamadan, Iran.\nDepartment of Microbiology, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghasemi', 'firstname': 'Ahmad', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'National Reference laboratory for Plague, Tularemia and Q fever, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Akanlu, Kabudar Ahang, Hamadan, Iran.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.\nDepartment of Bacteriology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Gouya', 'firstname': 'Mohammad Mehdi', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Center for Communicable Disease Control, Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Khayatzadeh', 'firstname': 'Simin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Communicable Disease Control, Deputy of Health, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahmoudi', 'firstname': 'Ahmad', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahangari Cohan', 'firstname': 'Hossein', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'National Reference laboratory for Plague, Tularemia and Q fever, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Akanlu, Kabudar Ahang, Hamadan, Iran.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Johansson', 'firstname': 'Anders', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Microbiology and Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden (MIMS), Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Maurin', 'firstname': 'Max', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Universite Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Grenoble INP, CHU Grenoble Alpes, TIMC-IMAG, 38000 Grenoble, Grenoble, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Mostafavi', 'firstname': 'Ehsan', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'National Reference laboratory for Plague, Tularemia and Q fever, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Akanlu, Kabudar Ahang, Hamadan, Iran. mostafavi@pasteur.ac.ir.\nDepartment of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Research Centre for Emerging and Reemerging infectious diseases, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran. mostafavi@pasteur.ac.ir.'}]"
33830386,Efficient strategies to enhance plasmid stability for fermentation of recombinant Escherichia coli harboring tyrosine phenol lyase.,Biotechnology letters,"To solve the bottleneck of plasmid instability during microbial fermentation of L-DOPA with recombinant Escherichia coli expressing heterologous tyrosine phenol lyase.
The tyrosine phenol lyase from Fusobacterium nucleatum was constitutively expressed in E. coli and a fed-batch fermentation process with temperature down-shift cultivation was performed. Efficient strategies including replacing the original ampicillin resistance gene, as well as inserting cer site that is active for resolving plasmid multimers were applied. As a result, the plasmid stability was increased. The co-use of cer site on plasmid and kanamycin in culture medium resulted in proportion of plasmid containing cells maintained at 100% after fermentation for 35 h. The specific activity of tyrosine phenol lyase reached 1493 U/g dcw, while the volumetric activity increased from 2943 to 14,408 U/L for L-DOPA biosynthesis.
The established strategies for plasmid stability is not only promoted the applicability of the recombinant cells for L-DOPA production, but also provides important guidance for industrial fermentation with improved microbial productivity.","10.1007/s10529-021-03082-5

33823861,The dysbiosis signature of Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer-cause or consequences? A systematic review.,Cancer cell international,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer globally and the fourth attributable cause of mortality and morbidity due to cancer. An emerging factor contributing to CRC is the gut microbiota and the cellular changes associated with it. Further insights on this may help in the prevention, diagnosis and new therapeutic approaches to colorectal cancer. In most cases of CRC, genetic factors appear to contribute less to its aetiology than environmental and epigenetic factors; therefore, it may be important to investigate these environmental factors, their effects, and the mechanisms that may contribute to this cancer. The gut microbiota has recently been highlighted as a potential risk factor that may affect the structural components of the tumor microenvironment, as well as free radical and enzymatic metabolites directly, or indirectly. Many studies have reported changes in the gut microbiota of patients with colorectal cancer. What is controversial is whether the cancer is the cause or consequence of the change in the microbiota. There is strong evidence supporting both possibilities. The presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum in human colorectal specimens has been demonstrated by RNA-sequencing. F. nucleatum has been shown to express high levels of virulence factors such as FadA, Fap2 and MORN2 proteins. Our review of the published data suggest that F. nucleatum may be a prognostic biomarker of CRC risk, and hence raises the potential of antibiotic treatment of F. nucleatum for the prevention of CRC.","10.1186/s12935-021-01886-z

33825850,Vaginal sialoglycan foraging by Gardnerella vaginalis: Mucus barriers as a meal for unwelcome guests?,Glycobiology,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition of the vaginal microbiome in which there are few lactobacilli and abundant anaerobic bacteria. Members of the genus Gardnerella are often one of the most abundant bacteria in BV. BV is associated with a wide variety of poor health outcomes for women. It has been recognized since the 1980s that women with BV have detectable and sometimes markedly elevated levels of sialidase activity in vaginal fluids and that bacteria associated with this condition produce this activity in culture. Mounting evidence collected using diverse methodologies points to the conclusion that BV is associated with a reduction in intact sialoglycans in cervico-vaginal secretions. Here we review evidence for the contributions of vaginal bacteria, especially Gardnerella, in the processes of mucosal sialoglycan degradation, uptake, metabolism, and depletion. Our understanding of the impacts of vaginal sialoglycan degradation is still limited. However, the potential implications of sialic acid depletion are discussed in light of our current understanding of the roles played by sialoglycans in vaginal physiology.",10.1093/glycob/cwab024,"[{'lastname': 'Agarwal', 'firstname': 'Kavita', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lewis', 'firstname': 'Amanda L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': None}]"

33836129,Bronchiectasis among Australian Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients in the regional and remote population of the Northern Territory of Australia.,Rural and remote health,"Chronic respiratory disorders are highly prevalent among Australian Aboriginal people living in the Top End Health Service region in the Northern Territory, Australia. Bronchiectasis is a heterogenous disease that features among these chronic respiratory conditions in this population. However, there are sparse comparative data between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis from this region.
In this retrospective study, demographics, clinical characteristics and relevant laboratory parameters were compared among adult Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2012 and 2017.
A total of 388 adults had radiology-confirmed bronchiectasis and 258 (66%) were Aboriginal. Compared to non-Aboriginal patients, Aboriginal patients were significantly younger (mean age 54 v 67 years), the majority lived in rural and remote communities (80% v 9 %), had higher rates of self-reported smoking (52% v 19%), alcohol consumption (29% v 12%) and co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (65% v 38%) and other chronic co-morbidities. Sputum microbiology was also different between the groups with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis being more common in Aboriginal patients, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus species and non-tuberculous mycobacteria were higher in non-Aboriginal patients.

33818909,Clinical and etiological analysis of co-infections and secondary infections in COVID-19 patients: an observational study.,The clinical respiratory journal,"To investigate the role of co-infections and secondary infections in disease severity of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19, a retrospective study was carried out between January 11 and March 1, 2020 among 408 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients in China. These patients were divided into three groups based on disease severity: mild or moderate, severe, or critically ill. Microbiological pathogens in blood, urine, and respiratory tract specimens were detected by the combination of culture, serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). The median age of participants was 48 years (IQR 34-60 years). 52 patients (12.7%) had at least one additional pathogen, 8.1% were co-infected, and 5.1% had a secondary infection. There were 13 Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, 8 Haemophilus influenza cases, 8 respiratory viruses, and 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae cases, primarily detected in mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. Hospital-acquired infection pathogens were more common in critically ill patients. Compared to those without additional pathogens, patients with co and/or secondary infections were more likely to receive antibiotics (p < 0.001) and have elevated levels of D-dimer (p = 0.0012), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p = 0.0027) and procalcitonin (PCT) (p = 0.0002). The performance of conventional culture was comparable with that of mNGS in diagnosis of secondary infections. Co-infections and secondary infections existed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and were relevant to the disease severity. Screening of common respiratory pathogens and hospital infection control should be strengthened.",10.1111/crj.13369,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Shuyan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Qing', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Xiao', 'firstname': 'Yanyu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Chi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Zhaofang', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Qu', 'firstname': 'Jiuxin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Southern University of Science and Technology, National Clinical Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Shenzhen, China.""}]"

33591973,Ulcerative skin lesions among children in Cameroon: It is not always Yaws.,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Outbreaks of yaws-like ulcerative skin lesions in children are frequently reported in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The origin of these lesions might be primarily traumatic or infectious; in the latter case, Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, the yaws agent, and Haemophilus ducreyi, the agent of chancroid, are two of the pathogens commonly associated with the aetiology of skin ulcers. In this work, we investigated the presence of T. p. pertenue and H. ducreyi DNA in skin ulcers in children living in yaws-endemic regions in Cameroon. Skin lesion swabs were collected from children presenting with yaws-suspected skin lesions during three outbreaks, two of which occurred in 2017 and one in 2019. DNA extracted from the swabs was used to amplify three target genes: the human β2-microglobulin gene to confirm proper sample collection and DNA extraction, the polA gene, highly conserved among all subspecies of T. pallidum, and the hddA gene of H. ducreyi. A fourth target, the tprL gene was used to differentiate T. p. pertenue from the other agents of human treponematoses in polA-positive samples. A total of 112 samples were analysed in this study. One sample, negative for β2-microglobulin, was excluded from further analysis. T. p. pertenue was only detected in the samples collected during the first 2017 outbreak (12/74, 16.2%). In contrast, H. ducreyi DNA could be amplified from samples from all three outbreaks (outbreak 1: 27/74, 36.5%; outbreak 2: 17/24, 70.8%; outbreak 3: 11/13, 84.6%). Our results show that H. ducreyi was more frequently associated to skin lesions in the examined children than T. p. pertenue, but also that yaws is still present in Cameroon. These findings strongly advocate for a continuous effort to determine the aetiology of ulcerative skin lesions during these recurring outbreaks, and to inform the planned mass treatment campaigns to eliminate yaws in Cameroon.",10.1371/journal.pntd.0009180,"[{'lastname': 'Ndzomo Ngono', 'firstname': 'Jean-Philippe', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Centre Pasteur du Cameroun, Yaounde, Cameroon.'}, {'lastname': 'Tchatchouang', 'firstname': 'Serges', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre Pasteur du Cameroun, Yaounde, Cameroon.'}, {'lastname': 'Noah Tsanga', 'firstname': 'Mireille Victorine', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'Centre Pasteur du Cameroun, Yaounde, Cameroon.'}, {'lastname': 'Njih Tabah', 'firstname': 'Earnest', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'National Yaws, Leishmaniasis, Leprosy and Buruli ulcer Control Programme, Ministry of Public Health, Yaounde, Cameroon.\nFaculty of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Dschang, West Region, Cameroon.'}, {'lastname': 'Tchualeu', 'firstname': 'Albert', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'National Laboratory of Public Health, Yaounde, Cameroon.'}, {'lastname': 'Asiedu', 'firstname': 'Kingsley', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Giacani', 'firstname': 'Lorenzo', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Eyangoh', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre Pasteur du Cameroun, Yaounde, Cameroon.'}, {'lastname': 'Crucitti', 'firstname': 'Tania', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Centre Pasteur du Cameroun, Yaounde, Cameroon.'}]"

33836129,Bronchiectasis among Australian Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients in the regional and remote population of the Northern Territory of Australia.,Rural and remote health,"Chronic respiratory disorders are highly prevalent among Australian Aboriginal people living in the Top End Health Service region in the Northern Territory, Australia. Bronchiectasis is a heterogenous disease that features among these chronic respiratory conditions in this population. However, there are sparse comparative data between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis from this region.
In this retrospective study, demographics, clinical characteristics and relevant laboratory parameters were compared among adult Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2012 and 2017.
A total of 388 adults had radiology-confirmed bronchiectasis and 258 (66%) were Aboriginal. Compared to non-Aboriginal patients, Aboriginal patients were significantly younger (mean age 54 v 67 years), the majority lived in rural and remote communities (80% v 9 %), had higher rates of self-reported smoking (52% v 19%), alcohol consumption (29% v 12%) and co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (65% v 38%) and other chronic co-morbidities. Sputum microbiology was also different between the groups with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis being more common in Aboriginal patients, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus species and non-tuberculous mycobacteria were higher in non-Aboriginal patients.

33792695,Genome-wide analysis of urogenital and respiratory multidrug-resistant Haemophilus parainfluenzae.,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,"To characterize the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and the prevalence of the polysaccharide capsule among urogenital and respiratory Haemophilus parainfluenzae isolates.
Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by microdilution. Fifty-five MDR strains were subjected to WGS and were phylogenetically compared with all the available H. parainfluenzae genomes from the NCBI database. The identification of the capsular bexA gene was performed by PCR in 266 non-MDR strains.
In 31 of the 42 ampicillin-resistant strains, blaTEM-1 located within Tn3 was identified. β-Lactamase-negative cefuroxime-resistant strains (n = 12) presented PBP3 substitutions. The catS gene (n = 14), the tet(M)-MEGA element (n = 18) and FolA substitutions (I95L and F154V/S) (n = 41) were associated with resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline plus macrolides, and co-trimoxazole, respectively. Thirty-seven isolates had a Tn10 harbouring tet(B)/(C)/(D)/(R) genes with (n = 15) or without (n = 22) catA2. Putative transposons (Tn7076-Tn7079), including aminoglycoside and co-trimoxazole resistance genes, were identified in 10 strains (18.2%). These transposons were integrated into three new integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), which also included the resistance-associated transposons Tn3 and Tn10. The capsular operon was found only in the urogenital isolates (18/154, 11.7%), but no phylogenetic clustering was observed. The capsular operons identified were similar to those of Haemophilus influenzae serotype c and Haemophilus sputorum type 2.
The identification of ICEs with up to three resistance-associated transposons suggests that these transferable elements play an important role in the acquisition of multidrug resistance in H. parainfluenzae. Moreover, the presence of polysaccharide capsules in some of these urogenital isolates is a cause for concern.",10.1093/jac/dkab109,"[{'lastname': 'Sierra', 'firstname': 'Yanik', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'González-Díaz', 'firstname': 'Aida', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.\nResearch Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Carrera-Salinas', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Berbel', 'firstname': 'Dàmaris', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.\nResearch Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Vázquez-Sánchez', 'firstname': 'Daniel Antonio', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.\nSpanish Network for Research in Infectious Diseases (REIPI), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Tubau', 'firstname': 'Fe', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.\nResearch Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cubero', 'firstname': 'Meritxell', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.\nResearch Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Garmendia', 'firstname': 'Junkal', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Research Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.\nInstituto de Agrobiotecnología, CSIC-Gobierno Navarra, Mutilva, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Càmara', 'firstname': 'Jordi', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.\nResearch Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ayats', 'firstname': 'Josefina', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.\nResearch Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ardanuy', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.\nResearch Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Pathology and Experimental Therapeutics, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Marti', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Department, Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain.\nResearch Network for Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES), ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}]"

Sixty-eight young patients with obesity were stratified for percentile distribution of MS abnormalities. A MS risk score was defined as low, medium, and high MS risk. High WBCs were defined as a count ≥ 7.0 10
We found reduced bacterial richness of fecal microbiota in patients with IR and high diastolic blood pressure (BP). Distinct microbial markers were associated to high BP (Clostridium and Clostridiaceae), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Lachnospiraceae, Gemellaceae, Turicibacter), and high MS risk (Coriobacteriaceae), WBCs (Bacteroides caccae, Gemellaceae), severe obesity (Lachnospiraceae), and impaired glucose tolerance (Bacteroides ovatus and Enterobacteriaceae). Conversely, taxa such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Parabacterodes, Bacteroides caccae, Oscillospira, Parabacterodes distasonis, Coprococcus, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were associated to low MS risk score, triglycerides, fasting glucose and HOMA-IR, respectively. Supervised multilevel analysis grouped clearly ""variable"" patients based on the MS risk.
This was a proof-of-concept study opening the way at the identification of fecal microbiota signatures, precisely associated with cardiometabolic risk factors in young patients with obesity. These evidences led us to infer, while some gut bacteria have a detrimental role in exacerbating metabolic risk factors some others are beneficial ameliorating cardiovascular host health.","10.1007/s00592-020-01669-4

This study examined the hypothesis that oral dysbiosis modulates the antigen-presentation function of SGECs, which regulates CD4 T cell proliferation in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Saliva samples from 8 pSS patients and 16 healthy subjects were analyzed for bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA. As a result, 39 differentially abundant taxa were identified. Among them, the phylum Proteobacteria comprised 21 taxa, and this phylum was mostly enriched in the healthy controls. The proteobacterium Haemophilus parainfluenzae was enriched in the healthy controls, with the greatest effect size at the species level. Treatment of A253 cells in vitro with H. parainfluenzae upregulated PD-L1 expression, and H. parainfluenzae-pretreated A253 cells suppressed CD4 T cell proliferation. The suppression was partially reversed by PD-L1 blockade. Among low-grade xerostomia patients, salivary abundance of H. parainfluenzae decreased in pSS patients compared to that in non-pSS sicca patients.

Structural analyses reveal that SHNP is completely composed of glucose, and its backbone consists of β-D-(1→3)-Glcp with side chains comprising t-β-D-Glcp attached at the O-6 position. Thus, SHNP is a laminarin-type polysaccharide. In vitro fermentation test results showed that SHNP was digested by gut microbiota; the pH value in the fecal culture of SHNP was significantly decreased; and total short-chain fatty acids, acetic, propionic and n-butyric acids were significantly increased. Furthermore, SHNP regulated the intestinal microbiota composition by stimulating the growth of species belonging to Enterobacteriaceae while depleting Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Gemmiger formicilis.

A Göttingen minipig model was assessed, using pertussis vaccines, to demonstrate that vaccine antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses, including IgG titers, functional antibodies, Th polarization and memory B cells can be assessed in a longitudinal study. A vaccination schedule of priming with a whole cell (DTwP) or an acellular (DTaP) pertussis vaccine was applied in neonatal and infant minipigs followed by boosting with a Tdap acellular vaccine. Single cell RNAsequencing was used to explore the long-term maintenance of immune memory cells and their functionality for the first time in this animal model. DTaP but not DTwP vaccination induced pertussis toxin (PT) neutralizing antibodies. The cellular immune response was also characterized by a distinct Th polarization, with a Th-2-biased response for DTaP and a Th-1/Th-17-biased response for DTwP. No difference in the maintenance of pertussis-specific memory B cells was observed in DTaP- or DTwP-primed animals 6 months post Tdap boost. However, an increase in pertussis-specific T cells was still observed in DTaP primed minipigs, together with up-regulation of genes involved in antigen presentation and interferon pathways. Overall, the minipig model reproduced the humoral and cellular immune responses induced in humans by DTwP vs. DTaP priming, followed by Tdap boosting. Our data suggest that the Göttingen minipig is an attractive preclinical model to predict the long-term immunogenicity of human vaccines against ",10.3389/fimmu.2021.613810,"[{'lastname': 'Vaure', 'firstname': 'Céline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Research and External Innovation, Sanofi Pasteur, Marcy l'Etoile, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Grégoire-Barou', 'firstname': 'Véronique', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""Research and External Innovation, Sanofi Pasteur, Marcy l'Etoile, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Courtois', 'firstname': 'Virginie', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""Research and External Innovation, Sanofi Pasteur, Marcy l'Etoile, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Chautard', 'firstname': 'Emilie', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Research and External Innovation, Sanofi Pasteur, Marcy l'Etoile, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Dégletagne', 'firstname': 'Cyril', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Research and External Innovation, Sanofi Pasteur, Marcy l'Etoile, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yuanqing', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Research and External Innovation, Sanofi Pasteur, Marcy l'Etoile, France.""}]"

33794378,"Pertussis among Patients with Clinically Compatible Illness in the Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,"Pertussis is an acute respiratory tract disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. In 2014, 24.1 million pertussis cases, resulting in 160,700 deaths were estimated to occur worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology of pertussis among patients with clinically compatible illness who visited selected hospitals in the Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia.
Cross-sectional study design was employed on pertussis patients with clinically compatible illness. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from five hundred-fifteen patients from July 2018 through February 2019. DNA was extracted from all nasopharyngeal swabs and samples were analyzed using real-time (RT-) PCR. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis, respectively.
The overall prevalence of Bordetella species among study participants was 156/515 (30.3%) [95% CI = 26.4-34.6] as determined by Bordetella RT-PCR, including 65/156 (41.7%) B. pertussis, 89/156 (57.1%) indeterminate B. pertussis, 1/156 (0.6%) B. holmesii and 1/156 (0.6%) B. parapertussis.

33789161,Lipid binding by the N-terminal motif mediates plasma membrane localization of Bordetella effector protein BteA.,The Journal of biological chemistry,"The respiratory pathogens Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica employ a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject a 69-kDa BteA effector protein into host cells. This effector is known to contain two functional domains, including an N-terminal lipid raft-targeting (LRT) domain, and a cytotoxic C-terminal domain that induces non-apoptotic and caspase-1-independent host cell death. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of BteA with plasma membrane as well as its cytotoxic activity in the course of Bordetella infections remain poorly understood. Using a protein-lipid overlay assay and surface plasmon resonance, we show here that the recombinant LRT domain binds negatively-charged membrane phospholipids. Specifically, we determined that the dissociation constants of the LRT domain binding liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidic acid (PA), and phosphatidylserine (PS) were ∼450 nM, ∼490 nM, and ∼1.2 μM, respectively. Both PS and PIP2 were required to target the LRT domain and/or full-length BteA to the plasma membrane of yeast cells. The membrane association further involved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of LRT, and depended on a leucine residue in the L1 loop between the first two helices of the four-helix bundle. Importantly, charge-reversal substitutions within the L1 region disrupted plasma membrane localization of the BteA effector without hampering its cytotoxic activity during B. bronchiseptica infection of HeLa cells. The LRT-mediated targeting of BteA to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane of host cells is, therefore, dispensable for effector cytotoxicity.",10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100607,"[{'lastname': 'Malcova', 'firstname': 'Ivana', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Bumba', 'firstname': 'Ladislav', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Uljanic', 'firstname': 'Filip', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuzmenko', 'firstname': 'Darya', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Nedomova', 'firstname': 'Jana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamanova', 'firstname': 'Jana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.

33825850,Vaginal sialoglycan foraging by Gardnerella vaginalis: Mucus barriers as a meal for unwelcome guests?,Glycobiology,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a condition of the vaginal microbiome in which there are few lactobacilli and abundant anaerobic bacteria. Members of the genus Gardnerella are often one of the most abundant bacteria in BV. BV is associated with a wide variety of poor health outcomes for women. It has been recognized since the 1980s that women with BV have detectable and sometimes markedly elevated levels of sialidase activity in vaginal fluids and that bacteria associated with this condition produce this activity in culture. Mounting evidence collected using diverse methodologies points to the conclusion that BV is associated with a reduction in intact sialoglycans in cervico-vaginal secretions. Here we review evidence for the contributions of vaginal bacteria, especially Gardnerella, in the processes of mucosal sialoglycan degradation, uptake, metabolism, and depletion. Our understanding of the impacts of vaginal sialoglycan degradation is still limited.

There is scant literature about NRCD in the pediatric population.
To determine the incidence, clinical characteristics and underlying causes of NRCD in children.
Retrospective cohort study performed at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH). Children < 18 years diagnosed with CeD by positive serology and duodenal biopsies compatible with Marsh III histology between 2008 and 2012 were identified in the BCH's Celiac Disease Program database. Medical records were longitudinally reviewed from the time of diagnosis through September 2015. NRCD was defined as persistent symptoms at 6 mo after the initiation of a GFD and causes of NRCD as well as symptom evolution were detailed. The children without symptoms at 6 mo (responders) were compared with the NRCD group. Additionally, presenting signs and symptoms at the time of diagnosis of CeD among the responders and NRCD patients were collected and compared to identify any potential predictors for NRCD at 6 mo of GFD therapy.
Six hundred and sixteen children were included. Ninety-one (15%) met criteria for NRCD. Most were female (77%). Abdominal pain [odds ratio (OR) 1.8 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9], constipation (OR 3.1 95%CI 1.9-4.9) and absence of abdominal distension (OR for abdominal distension 0.4 95%CI 0.1-0.98) at diagnosis were associated with NRCD. NRCD was attributed to a wide variety of diagnoses with gluten exposure (30%) and constipation (20%) being the most common causes. Other causes for NRCD included lactose intolerance (9%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), functional abdominal pain (7%), irritable bowel syndrome (3%), depression/anxiety (3%), eosinophilic esophagitis (2%), food allergy (1%), eating disorder (1%), gastric ulcer with

Carcinogenic foodborne trematodes Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis, and O. felineus might promote transmission and spread of H. pylori infection in the definitive mammalian host, which in turn might contribute to the liver fluke-associated malignancy. Our objectives were to find out whether liver flukes O. felineus, O. viverrini, and C. sinensis are carriers of Helicobacter pylori and to determine whether H. pylori is present in feces, bile, and stomach samples from the experimentally infected hamsters. We found that liver flukes are not reservoirs of H. pylori. Nevertheless, the prevalence of H. pylori and the H. pylori ureA gene copy number were significantly elevated after the infection. Overall, although the liver flukes O. felineus, C. sinensis, and O. viverrini are not reservoirs of H. pylori, the infection with the liver flukes significantly modifies the biliary and gut microbiota by increasing H. pylori abundance. This may be a feature of any liver fluke pathogenesis that have not previously been taken into account. Our findings appear to be novel in terms of comparative assessment of the host microbiota and Helicobacter abundance during epidemiologically important liver fluke infections.","10.1038/s41598-021-87446-x

33832076,Intravenous versus oral omeprazole on patients with high risk bleeding peptic ulcers: A prospective randomized clinical trial protocol.,Medicine,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) decrease the rate of rebleeding following endoscopic hemostatic therapy in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. This study compares the efficacy of oral omeprazole vs intravenous omeprazole in decrease of rebleeding of peptic ulcer patients.
The present study was authorized by the local research ethics committee of Jiangjin District Central Hospital (2020120987) and informed consent was obtained from all patients. All adult patients who were admitted to medical emergency rooms of Jiangjin District Central Hospital due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (as evidenced by hematemesis, melena or hematochezia) were considered for inclusion in the study. Endoscopy was performed within 24 hours after admission. Patients older than 18 years with successful endoscopic therapy of high risk ulcers [defined as active bleeding (Forrest IA, IB), non-bleeding visible vessel (NBVV, Forrest IIA) or adherent clots (Forrest IIB)] were enrolled. Patients with low risk ulcers (clean base, ulcers with a simple washable clot), suspicious malignant ulcer, bleeding tendency, uremia, liver cirrhosis, Mallory Weiss tear or already on PPI as an outpatient were excluded from study. All were managed endoscopically by injecting 5-30 ml of epinephrine (diluted 1:10000) around the ulcer crater. Cavitations or flattening of bleeding vessel and disappearance of NBVV was considered as established homeostasis. A biopsy was taken from antrum for evaluating Helicobacter pylori infection. Patient with unsuccessful endoscopic therapy were not enrolled and were referred to general surgeon. Information on demography, history of previous upper gastrointestinal bleeding, NSAID or ASA ingestion, ulcer location, bleeding stigmata and blood transfusion volume at entry were recorded in all patients. In the oral omeprazole group, the patients received 40 mg omeprazole orally twice daily for 72 hours. In intravenous omeprazole group, they received omeprazole 80 mg bolus and then 8 mg/hour infusion for 48-72 hours. Then, all patients received omeprazole 20 mg orally for 30 days. On the day of discharge Helicobacter pylori infected patients received standard regimens.
Figure 1 showed the primary and secondary end points.
Intravenous administration of PPIs has limitations. They are expensive, require a dedicated intravenous line, need nursing supervision and hospital admission. So, it would be reasonable to prescribe oral PPIs to patients with high risk bleeding ulcers provided that it is as effective as its intravenous counterpart. Oral PPIs have a high bioavailability. Its effect initiates one hour after ingestion and the maximal plasma concentration is achieved after 2-3 hours. However, there are few studies comparing oral and intravenous PPI in decreasing risk of rebleeding in peptic ulcer patients. More high quality randomized controlled trials are still necessary.

33832060,H. pylori negative gastric MALT lymphoma with API2-MALT1 translocation treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection: A case report.,Medicine,"API2-MALT1 positive gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas are considered to have favorable prognosis. We report a case of API2-MALT1 positive gastric MALT lymphoma, treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).
A 51-year-old man underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for the annual health checkup examination.
The EGD showed a reddish depressed lesion with small reddish spots in the lower gastric body. There was no endoscopic atrophy in the entire stomach and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) serum test was negative. Infiltration of small lymphocytes was shown in the gastric tissues obtained by the endoscopic biopsy. The fluorescence in situ hybridization using the biopsy samples confirmed the presence of genetic translocation of API2-MALT1, suggesting that the lesion is API2-MALT1 positive MALT lymphoma.
Since endoscopic ultrasound suggested that the lesion was localized within the lamina propria mucosae, we performed ESD to achieve the en bloc resection of the lesion.
Conclusive diagnosis of gastric MALT lymphoma was made based on the resected specimen. Lateral and vertical margins were negative. No lymphoma cells were detected using endoscopic biopsy after 5 years.
Our report suggests that ESD can be considered as alternative treatment for API2-MALT1 positive gastric MALT lymphoma if the lesion was localized within the gastric mucosa.",10.1097/MD.0000000000024371,"[{'lastname': 'Tahara', 'firstname': 'Tomomitsu', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Osaka.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Horiguchi', 'firstname': 'Noriyuki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Terada', 'firstname': 'Tsuyoshi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoshida', 'firstname': 'Dai', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Okubo', 'firstname': 'Masaaki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Funasaka', 'firstname': 'Kohei', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakagawa', 'firstname': 'Yoshihito', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shibata', 'firstname': 'Tomoyuki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ohmiya', 'firstname': 'Naoki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.'}]"

The objective of the study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with 14-day mortality for patients with bacteremia due to OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study of adult patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia, classifying the strains as carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKp) and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKp). All of the CRKp strains were the OXA-48-type.The study included 202 cases of bacteremia: 114 due to CSKp and 88 due to CRKp. The clinical cure rate was higher for the patients with CSKp (85% vs 69% for CSKp and CRKp, respectively; P = .010), while the 14-day mortality rate was lower (13% vs 30%, P = .005). An INCREMENT-CPE score ≥7 (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.50-6.25, P = .002) was the only independent factor associated with 14-day mortality for the patients with Klebsiella spp. bacteremia. Other factors related to 14-day mortality were a rapidly fatal prognosis (McCabe) (HR 7.1, 95% CI 2.75-18.37, P < .001), dementia (HR 5.9, 95% CI 2.0-7.43, P = .001), and a high-risk source of infection (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.06-6.82, P = .038).The most important factors associated with 14-day mortality for the patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia was an INCREMENT-CPE score ≥7, dementia, a McCabe score indicating a rapidly fatal prognosis and a high-risk source of infection.

29617372,"Trends in the relative prevalence of genital ulcer disease pathogens and association with HIV infection in Johannesburg, South Africa, 2007-2015.",PloS one,"In South Africa, treatment of genital ulcer disease (GUD) occurs in the context of syndromic management. GUD aetiological studies have been conducted in Johannesburg since 2007. We report on GUD pathogen prevalence, sero-prevalence of STI co-infections and aetiological trends among GUD patients presenting to a community-based primary healthcare facility in Johannesburg over a 9-year period.
GUD surveys were conducted from January to April each year. Consecutive genital ulcers were sampled from consenting adults. Swab-extracted DNA was tested by multiplex real-time PCR assays for herpes simplex virus (HSV), Treponema pallidum (TP), Haemophilus ducreyi (HD) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT). HSV-positive DNA extracts were further subtyped into HSV-1 and HSV-2 using a commercial PCR assay; CT-positive extracts were tested with an in-house PCR assay specific for serovars L1-L3 (lymphogranuloma venereum). Sera were tested for HIV, HSV-2, and syphilis co-infections. Giemsa-stained ulcer smears were screened for Klebsiella granulomatis by microscopy. Data were analysed with STATATM version 14. Of 771 GUD specimens, 503 (65.2%) had a detectable pathogen: HSV 468 (60.7%); TP 30 (3.9%); CT L1-3 7 (0.9%); HD 4 (0.5%). No aetiological agents were detected in 270 (34.8%) ulcer specimens. Seroprevalence rates were as follows: HIV 61.7%; HSV-2 80.2% and syphilis 5.8%. There was a strong association between GUD pathogen detection and HIV seropositivity (p < 0.001); 68% of cases caused by HSV were co-infected with HIV. There was a significant decline in the relative prevalence of ulcer-derived HSV over time, predominantly from 2013-2015 (p-value for trend = 0.023); and a trend towards a decrease in the HIV seropositivity rate (p-value for trend = 0.209).
HSV remains the leading cause of pathogen-detectable GUD in South Africa. The prevalence of HIV co-infection among GUD patients is high, underlining the importance of linkage to universal HIV testing and treatment in primary healthcare settings.",10.1371/journal.pone.0194125,"[{'lastname': 'Kularatne', 'firstname': 'Ranmini S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Centre for HIV & STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.\nDepartment of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Muller', 'firstname': 'Etienne E', 'initials': 'EE', 'affiliation': 'Centre for HIV & STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Maseko', 'firstname': 'Dumisile V', 'initials': 'DV', 'affiliation': 'Centre for HIV & STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Kufa-Chakezha', 'firstname': 'Tendesayi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Centre for HIV & STIs, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannesburg, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Lewis', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': 'Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.\nWestern Sydney Sexual Health Centre, Western Sydney Local Health District, Sydney, Australia.'}]"

The susceptibility of 5,351 isolates collected in 11 Spanish hospitals (2016-2018) were analysed (EUCAST-2020 criteria) by broth microdilution and were phenotypically studied for the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Ceftolozane-tazobactam and/or carbapenem resistant isolates were genetically characterized for ESBL and carbapenemases.
Escherichia coli was the most frequent pathogen (49.3% IAI, 54.9% UTI, 16.7% RTI and 50% BSI), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.9%, 19.1%, 13.1% and 15.4%, respectively). P. aeruginosa was isolated in 9.3%, 5.6%, 32% and 9%, respectively. The frequency of isolates with ESBLs (2016-2017) was: 30.5% K. pneumoniae, 8.6% E. coli, 2.3% Klebsiella oxytoca and 0.7% Proteus mirabilis. Ceftolozane-tazobactam was very active against non-ESBL-(99.3% susceptible) and ESBL-(95.2%) producing E. coli being less active against K. pneumoniae (98% and 43.1%, respectively) isolates. CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent ESBL in E. coli (27.5%) and K. pneumoniae (51.9%) frequently associated with OXA-48-like carbapenemase. Overall, 93% of P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to ceftolozane-tazobactam, preserving this activity (>75%) in isolates resistant to other beta-lactams except in those resistant to meropenen or ceftazidime-avibactam. GES-5, PER-1, VIM-1/2 were the most prevalent enzymes in isolates resistant to ceftolozane-tazobactam.

A total of 839 individual rectal swabs from pigs on 164 farms and 271 faecal samples of humans working on pig farms and persons living in the same household in Khon Kaen, Thailand were screened for gut colonization by KP. Genomic sequences were investigated for antibiotic resistance and virulence genes. Phylogenetic analyses were performed in addition to comparison with isolates from previous studies from Thailand.
KP was detected in approximately 50% of pig and human samples. In total, 253 KP isolates were obtained: 39% from pigs, 34% from farmers and 26% from individuals living on the same farm but without animal contact. MLST revealed high genetic diversity with 196 different STs distributed over four phylogroups (Kp1 to Kp4). Low prevalence of ESBL-KP (7.5%) and colistin-resistant KP (3.2%) was observed among pigs and humans. Remarkably, four convergent MDR and hypervirulent strains were observed: one from pigs (ST290) and three from humans [ST35, ST3415 (strain 90CP1), ST17 (strain 90CM2)]. Sharing of KP clones among pigs and humans was identified for some STs including ST4788, ST661, ST3541 and ST29.
The study indicated a low prevalence of ESBL and mcr genes among KP isolated from pigs and healthy humans in Thailand and suggested the possibility of zoonotic transmission for a subset of circulating KP clones.",10.1093/jac/dkab118,"[{'lastname': 'Leangapichart', 'firstname': 'Thongpan', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Section for Food Safety and Animal Health Research, Department of Animal Health, Welfare and Food Safety, Norwegian Veterinary Institute, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Lunha', 'firstname': 'Kamonwan', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiwakanon', 'firstname': 'Jatesada', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Research Group for Animal Health Technology, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Angkititrakul', 'firstname': 'Sunpetch', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Research Group for Animal Health Technology, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Järhult', 'firstname': 'Josef D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Zoonosis Science Centre, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Magnusson', 'firstname': 'Ulf', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Sunde', 'firstname': 'Marianne', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Section for Food Safety and Animal Health Research, Department of Animal Health, Welfare and Food Safety, Norwegian Veterinary Institute, Oslo, Norway.'}]"

The current study was aimed to investigate the influence of PPIs and H2 blockers on the in vitro proliferation of selected intestinal bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.
Cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Candida albicans, and Blastocystis subtype 3 were treated with different concentrations of respective medications in vitro, and the numbers of microorganisms were quantified and compared.
Pantoprazole and esomeprazole exerted a significant inhibition on Blastocystis and C. albicans, especially at higher concentrations, which were even more effective than metronidazole. On the other hand, treatment with pantoprazole caused an increase in proliferation of L. rhamnosus and E. coli. There was no influence of H2 blockers on the examined microorganisms.
PPIs, such as pantoprazole, can be a potential treatment in the prophylaxis or eradication of Blastocystis and C. albicans.",10.14309/ctg.0000000000000325,"[{'lastname': 'Lepczyńska', 'firstname': 'Małgorzata', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dzika', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'WenChieh', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Chien-Yu', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}]"
33835045,Probiotic Lactobacillus kefiri prevents endotoxin-induced preterm birth and stillbirth in mice.,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)","Preterm birth (PTB), defined as birth occurring before 37 weeks of pregnancy, affects 5-18% of pregnancies and is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although PTB is considered a syndrome, infection-induced inflammation accounts up to 50% of all cases. Despite the effort to reduce the incidence of PTB, it continues rising worldwide and current approaches for preventing or treating PTB are largely unsatisfactory. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. It is well known that probiotics can modulate the host immune system exerting a potent anti-inflammatory activity. The main aim of this work was to evaluate the capacity of the probiotic Lactobacillus kefiri (Lk48) to prevent preterm birth in mice. C57BL/6 female mice were treated with Lk48 or vehicle a week before and during pregnancy and were challenged with LPS (10 µg), a dose known to induce 100% of PTB, on gestational day 16. Percentages of PTB as well as stillbirth were evaluated. We observed that oral administration of Lk48 significantly reduced the occurrence of LPS-induced PTB and stillbirth as well as improved post-natal development. This protective effect was associated with a reduction in leucocyte infiltration and reduced inflammation-induced damage in reproductive tissue. Besides, Lk48 treatment also modulated the diversity of vaginal microbiota. Our results demonstrated that prophylactic consumption of probiotic Lactobacillus kefiri prevented LPS-induced PTB and still birth in mice and open new avenues for exploring novel and promising strategies for preventing PTB in humans.",10.1530/REP-20-0642,"[{'lastname': 'Ventimiglia', 'firstname': 'María Silvia', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'M Ventimiglia, CONICET, CEFYBO, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Valeff', 'firstname': 'Natalin Jimena', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': 'N Valeff, CONICET, CEFYBO, Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, 1121, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Pozo Albán', 'firstname': 'Marlon', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'M pozo Albán, Immunology of Pregnancy Laboratory, CEFYBO, BUENOS AIRES, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Paturlanne', 'firstname': 'Juan Manuel', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'J Paturlanne, Immunology of Pregnancy Laboratory, CEFYBO, BUENOS AIRES, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Juriol', 'firstname': 'Lorena', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'L Juriol, CONICET, CEFYBO, CABA, 1121, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Quadrana', 'firstname': 'Florencia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'F Quadrana, Immunology of Pregnancy Laboratory, CEFYBO, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Cecotti', 'firstname': 'Martina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'M Cecotti, CONICET, YPF Tecnología, BUENOS AIRES, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Malamud', 'firstname': 'Mariano', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'M Malamud, Cátedra de Microbiología, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, UNLP, La Plata, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Dibo', 'firstname': 'Marcos Javier', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'M Dibo, Immunology of Pregnancy Laboratory, CEFYBO, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Serradell', 'firstname': 'María De Los Ángeles', 'initials': 'MLÁ', 'affiliation': 'M Serradell, Cátedra de Microbiología, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, UNLP, La Plata, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Jensen', 'firstname': 'Federico', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'F Jensen, Immunology of Pregnancy Laboratory, CEFYBO, BUENOS AIRES, Argentina.'}]"
33832437,Association between aging-dependent gut microbiome dysbiosis and dry eye severity in C57BL/6 male mouse model: a pilot study.,BMC microbiology,"While aging is a potent risk factor of dry eye disease, age-related gut dysbiosis is associated with inflammation and chronic geriatric diseases. Emerging evidence have demonstrated that gut dysbiosis contributes to the pathophysiology or exacerbation of ocular diseases including dry eye disease. However, the relationship between aging-related changes in gut microbiota and dry eye disease has not been elucidated. In this pilot study, we investigated the association between aging-dependent microbiome changes and dry eye severity in C57BL/6 male mice.
Eight-week-old (8 W, n = 15), one-year-old (1Y, n = 10), and two-year-old (2Y, n = 8) C57BL/6 male mice were used. Dry eye severity was assessed by corneal staining scores and tear secretion. Bacterial genomic 16 s rRNA from feces was analyzed. Main outcomes were microbiome compositional differences among the groups and their correlation to dry eye severity. In aged mice (1Y and 2Y), corneal staining increased and tear secretion decreased with statistical significance. Gut microbiome α-diversity was not different among the groups. However, β-diversity was significantly different among the groups. In univariate analysis, phylum Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and genus Alistipes, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Paraprevotella, and Helicobacter were significantly related to dry eye severity. After adjustment of age, multivariate analysis revealed phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and genus Lactobacillus, Alistipes, Prevotella, Paraprevotella, and Helicobacter to be significantly associated with dry eye severity.
Our pilot study suggests that aging-dependent changes in microbiome composition are related to severity of dry eye signs in C57BL/6 male mice.","10.1186/s12866-021-02173-7

During the experimental period, low-calcium diet-fed mice were administered with calcium chloride to simulate daily calcium supplementation. Meanwhile, different levels of KOS intervened by adding them into the diet. After 8 weeks, the calcium balance status, bone mass parameters, and gut environment modulation were evaluated. The results showed that dietary KOS intervention alleviated the negative calcium balance, significantly promoted the trabecular number and cortical thickness, and remarkably enhanced the skeletal mechanical strength. Moreover, Pearson's correlation analysis among significantly changed gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and relevant physiological indexes showed that the microbial genera of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Mucispirillum, Alistipes, and unidentified Clostridia and gut metabolites of kynurenine and testosterone were significantly associated with increased bone mass.

In this study, we aimed to develop appropriate heat treatments for industrial preparation of probiotics with antioxidant activity. Among 75 heat-killed strains, Lactococcus lactis MG5125 revealed the highest nitric oxide inhibition (86.2%), followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus MG4559 (86.0%), Lactobacillus plantarum MG5270 (85.7%), Lactobacillus fermentum MG4510 (85.3%), L. plantarum MG5239 (83.9%), L. plantarum MG5289 (83.2%), and L. plantarum MG5203 (81.8%). Moreover, the heat-killed selected strains markedly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. The use of heat-killed bacteria with intact bio-functionality can elongate the shelf-life and simplify the food processing steps of probiotic foods, given their high stability. The antioxidant and immune-modulatory activities of the heat-killed strains selected in this study indicate a strong potential for their utilization probiotic products manufacturing.","10.1007/s12602-021-09781-9

33812560,Fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking analysis of the binding of Lactobacillus acidophilus GIM1.208 β-glucosidase with quercetin glycosides.,Enzyme and microbial technology,"Lactobacillus acidophilus is an important probiotic. The β-glucosidase produced by L. acidophilus GIM1.208 can transform quercetin glycosides of Rosa roxburghii Tratt to release quercetin and improve the functional activity of raw materials. Understanding the interaction and the characteristics of the two will lay a theoretical foundation for the site-directed transformation and functional application of the catalytic active site of enzymes. In our study, using the heterologously expressed and highly stable, purified L. acidophilus GIM1.208 BGL as the strain, the representative quercetin in β-glucosidase and Rosa roxburghii Tratt was preliminarily predicted and explored using ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy combined with molecular docking was used to determine the interaction characteristics of the glycoside substrates, rutin (Rut) and isoquercitrin (Iso). Results from molecular docking showed that Asp159, Arg56, Iso294, Phe292, and Gly25 were the main residues of β-glucosidase and Rut. Arg56 was found to be the most crucial residue of β-glucosidase and isoquercitrin; the interaction between Rut and Iso and β-glucosidase was mainly driven by hydrogen bonding. The combined free energy of β-glucosidase and Iso was found to be -182.10 kcal/mol, while that of β-glucosidase and Rut was -32.37 kcal/mol. The results of fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the fluorescence intensity of β-glucosidase decreased with an increase in Rut and Iso concentrations. This interaction made β-glucosidase quench endogenous fluorescence, which was static quenching.

Results showed that the acetate levels were significantly higher in C-Bb, C-La, and C-Lg yogurts than in C yogurt. Fermentation and physicochemical characteristics of all yogurts were identical. Treatment of mucus-secreting colon epithelial cells (HT29-MTX) with C-Bb, C-La, and C-Lg yogurt supernatants resulted in an increase in the expression of MUC2 and CDX2 and the production of mucin proteins. The adhesion of probiotics onto HT29-MTX cells increased following treatment with C-Bb, C-La, and C-Lg yogurt supernatants. Our data suggest that a yogurt diet rich in acetate improves the protective function of the intestinal epithelium.",10.3168/jds.2020-19820,"[{'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Y H', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Biotechnology of Animal Resources, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jeong', 'firstname': 'C H', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Biotechnology of Animal Resources, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'W N', 'initials': 'WN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Biotechnology of Animal Resources, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'D M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Biotechnology of Animal Resources, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'S G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food Science and Biotechnology of Animal Resources, Konkuk University, Seoul 05029, Republic of Korea.

In this study, we analyzed the effects of adding the single probiotics Lactobacillus casei Zhang (Zhang) or Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Probio-M8 (M8) or a combination of Zhang and M8 to starter cultures on volatile and nonvolatile metabolomic profiles after 14 d of storage at 4°C and compared using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and GC-MS-based metabolomics approach. Principal component analysis, heatmap plots, and Spearman correlation results showed that Zhang alone had a greater effect on volatile and nonvolatile metabolomic profiles than M8 alone. The combination of Zhang and M8 had additive effects on the production of metabolites. For volatile metabolites, the levels of acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetoin, and acetic acid were higher for the combination of Zhang and M8 compared with either single probiotic culture. Significantly increased nonvolatile components induced by adding Zhang were identified were enriched in the galactose, amino- and nucleotide sugar, fructose and mannose, purine, phenylalanine metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis pathways. The metabolism and biosynthesis of starch, sucrose, tyrosine, galactose metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis were significantly upregulated by adding the combination of Zhang and M8.

Using the extrusion encapsulation technique, it was possible to obtain microcapsules whose matrix composition and dimensions correspond to the requirements of the food industry. The microcapsules obtained showed significantly different physicochemical properties, with different survival rates during processing, storage and in simulated gastrointestinal conditions. The encapsulation efficiency was very high in relation to the dimensions of the microcapsules and the technique used (between 87.00-88.19%). The microcapsules obtained offered a very good viability (between 8.30 ± 0.00-9.00 ± 0, 02 log10 cfu/g) during the 30 days of storage at 2-8 degrees and also in the simulated gastrointestinal conditions (between 7.98-8.22 log10 cfu/g).

Oral treatment with the adhesin from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) fimbriae protects against several autoimmune diseases in an antigen (Ag)-independent manner. Lactococcus lactis, which was recently adapted to express CFA/I fimbriae (LL-CFA/I), effectively suppresses inflammation by the induction of infectious tolerance via Ag-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs), that produce IL-10 and TGF-β. To test the hypothesis that CFA/I fimbriae can offset the development of inflammatory T cells via Treg induction, oral treatments with LL-CFA/I were performed on the spontaneous, genetically defined model for SjS, C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice to maintain salivary flow.
Six-week (wk)-old C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice were orally dosed with LL-CFA/I and treated every 3 wks; control groups were given L. lactis vector or PBS. LL-CFA/I-treated mice retained salivary flow up to 28 wks of age and showed significantly reduced incidence of inflammatory infiltration into the submandibular and lacrimal glands relative to PBS-treated mice. A significant increase in Foxp3
These data demonstrate that oral LL-CFA/I reduce or halts SjS progression, and these studies will provide the basis for future testing in SjS patients.","10.1186/s13075-021-02475-1

33821549,Proteome constraints reveal targets for improving microbial fitness in nutrient-rich environments.,Molecular systems biology,"Cells adapt to different conditions via gene expression that tunes metabolism for maximal fitness. Constraints on cellular proteome may limit such expression strategies and introduce trade-offs. Resource allocation under proteome constraints has explained regulatory strategies in bacteria. It is unclear, however, to what extent these constraints can predict evolutionary changes, especially for microorganisms that evolved under nutrient-rich conditions, i.e., multiple available nitrogen sources, such as Lactococcus lactis. Here, we present a proteome-constrained genome-scale metabolic model of L. lactis (pcLactis) to interpret growth on multiple nutrients. Through integration of proteomics and flux data, in glucose-limited chemostats, the model predicted glucose and arginine uptake as dominant constraints at low growth rates. Indeed, glucose and arginine catabolism were found upregulated in evolved mutants. At high growth rates, pcLactis correctly predicted the observed shutdown of arginine catabolism because limited proteome availability favored lactate for ATP production. Thus, our model-based analysis is able to identify and explain the proteome constraints that limit growth rate in nutrient-rich environments and thus form targets of fitness improvement.",10.15252/msb.202010093,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nNovo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'van Pelt-KleinJan', 'firstname': 'Eunice', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Olst', 'firstname': 'Berdien', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nHost-Microbe Interactomics, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands.\nLaboratory of Biochemistry, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Douwenga', 'firstname': 'Sieze', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Boeren', 'firstname': 'Sjef', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nLaboratory of Biochemistry, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bachmann', 'firstname': 'Herwig', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nNIZO Food Research, Ede, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Molenaar', 'firstname': 'Douwe', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Nielsen', 'firstname': 'Jens', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nNovo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nNovo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.\nBioInnovation Institute, Copenhagen N, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Teusink', 'firstname': 'Bas', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}]"

In this study, we aimed to develop appropriate heat treatments for industrial preparation of probiotics with antioxidant activity. Among 75 heat-killed strains, Lactococcus lactis MG5125 revealed the highest nitric oxide inhibition (86.2%), followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus MG4559 (86.0%), Lactobacillus plantarum MG5270 (85.7%), Lactobacillus fermentum MG4510 (85.3%), L. plantarum MG5239 (83.9%), L. plantarum MG5289 (83.2%), and L. plantarum MG5203 (81.8%). Moreover, the heat-killed selected strains markedly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. The use of heat-killed bacteria with intact bio-functionality can elongate the shelf-life and simplify the food processing steps of probiotic foods, given their high stability. The antioxidant and immune-modulatory activities of the heat-killed strains selected in this study indicate a strong potential for their utilization probiotic products manufacturing.","10.1007/s12602-021-09781-9

33782375,Leclercia adecarboxylata Bacteremia without a Focus in a Non-Immunosuppressed Patient.,The American journal of case reports,"BACKGROUND Leclercia adecarboxylata is a gram-negative rod, which is normally found in water and food. It is an emerging pathogen that affects immunocompromised patients, including patients with hematological malignancies or those receiving chemotherapy. Generally, L. adecarboxylata is considered a low-virulence pathogen with an excellent susceptibility profile, but some strains may be resistant to multiple antibiotics, such as b-lactams. Moreover, L. adecarboxylata is usually isolated as a part of polymicrobial cultures in immunocompetent individuals, but there have been cases where it was the only isolate. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old woman who was non-immunosuppressed and had multiple comorbidities was admitted with acute decompensated heart failure due to pneumonia. She was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics including amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin for pneumonia, but her infection worsened, and she had cardiopulmonary arrest. After resuscitation, she was stable for several days but suddenly became confused and hypotensive. The septic screen showed L. adecarboxylata bacteremia without a clear source, which was treated successfully with meropenem for 14 days. After the meropenem course, the patient developed diarrhea and was found to have severe Clostridium difficile infection. She did not respond to oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole and died. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrated an infection in a non-immunosuppressed individual by an organism that is considered an opportunistic pathogen, mainly affecting immunocompromised patients. The patient's blood culture grew L. adecarboxylata, which was sensitive to all antibiotics but resolved with meropenem treatment. Owing to increasing L. adecarboxylata infections, we recommend further studies to understand the organism's pathogenesis, risk factors, and resistance pattern.",10.12659/AJCR.929537,"[{'lastname': 'Shaikhain', 'firstname': 'Talal', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Guard Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Husayni', 'firstname': 'Faisal', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Guard Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Fawaz', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Guard Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Alghamdi', 'firstname': 'Erada M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Amri', 'firstname': 'Abdulfattah', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\nDepartment of Microbiology, National Guard Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\nDepartment of Microbiology, King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Alfares', 'firstname': 'Mona', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases, National Guard Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.'}]"

For 10 days, 25 patients who received intravenous TPN from the same batch of a formula developed sepsis and had blood cultures positive for L. adecarboxylata. Antimicrobial susceptibility and carbapenemase production were performed in 31 isolates, including one from an unopened bottle of TPN. Carbapenemase-encoding genes, extended-spectrum β-lactamase-encoding genes were screened by PCR, and plasmid profiles were determined. Horizontal transfer of carbapenem resistance was performed by solid mating. Clonal diversity was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The resistome was explored by whole-genome sequencing on two selected strains, and comparative genomics was performed using Roary.
All 31 isolates were resistant to aztreonam, cephalosporins, carbapenems, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and susceptible to gentamicin, tetracycline, and colistin. Lower susceptibility to levofloxacin (51.6%) and ciprofloxacin (22.6%) was observed. All the isolates were carbapenemase producers and positive for bla

33616945,Fatal sepsis associated with a storage container leak permitting platelet contamination with environmental bacteria after pathogen reduction.,Transfusion,"Pathogen reduction technology and enhanced bacterial culture screening promise to significantly reduce the risk of transfusion-associated septic reactions due to contaminated platelets.

Since plant x bacteria interaction is genotype and strain dependent, searching for new strains may contribute to the development of new biofertilizers. We aim to characterize plant growth-promoting capacity of Leclercia adecarboxylata strain Palotina, formerly isolated by our group in corn. A single isolated colony was taken and its genome was sequenced using Illumina technology. The whole genome was compared to other Leclercia adecarboxylata strains, and their biological and growth-promoting traits, such as P solubilization and auxin production, were tested. Following that, a 4.8 Mb genome of L. adecarboxylata strain Palotina was assembled and the functional annotation was carried out. This paper is the first to report the genes associated with plant growth promotion demonstrating in vitro indole acid production by this strain.

Despite the fact he was on appropriate antibiotics, his condition worsened, and he was eventually diagnosed with Legionella pneumonia, which was thought to be resistant to macrolides. His condition improved significantly when antibiotics were switched to levofloxacin. It is important to keep in mind other causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) during the ongoing COVID-19 era. What makes this case unique is that it presented a confusing scenario due to the patient's concurrent COVID-19 infection and his failure to improve with the administration of azithromycin.",10.7759/cureus.13632,"[{'lastname': 'Hussain', 'firstname': 'Khandakar M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, Johnstown, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Alam', 'firstname': 'Md Didar Ul', 'initials': 'MDU', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center, Johnstown, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahmad', 'firstname': 'Nuzhat T', 'initials': 'NT', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College, Sylhet, BGD.'}]"
33813251,Are pathogenic Legionella non-pneumophila a common bacteria in Water Distribution Networks?,Water research,"The present study analyzes at the national level, the presence of circulating Legionella in the artificial aquatic systems of different facilities of all of them state-owned centers throughout Spain for 12 months. 1754 water samples from various state-owned centers were collected from January to December 2014. Samples were collected from the cooling towers and evaporative condensers (CTC), and water distribution networks such as domestic hot water (DHW), cold water for human consumption (CW), sprinkler irrigation systems (SIS), fire sprinkler systems (FSS), and water from decorative fountains (DF). All these facilities are considered, according to current regulations, as potential amplifying systems for bacteria and possible sources of infection by the generation of droplets and aerosols. The isolation and counting of Legionella in water samples was carried out using microbiological culture following the international normative UNE-EN-ISO 11,731:2007 (ISO 11,731:1998) and UNE-EN ISO 8199:2008 (ISO 8199:2005).The quantification of Legionella colonization, the annual distribution, and the geographical distribution of the Legionella isolates recovered in the water were analyzed. Besides, molecular techniques were used for the characterization of the Legionella non-pneumophila isolates. Legionella was recovered from 15.79% of the analyzed water samples. High colonization was more frequently detected in water samples from CTC, DHW, CW, and DF. Regarding the geographic distribution, positive samples of Legionella were obtained in 14 of the 18 Spanish locations analyzed. Legionella non-pneumophila was the most prevalent and was isolated from water samples from 13 different geographical locations (72%). Legionella anisa and Legionella jordanis were the most frequently non-pneumophila species isolated. Legionella donaldsonii was isolated for the first time in the water distribution networks in Spain. Legionella pneumophila sg 2-14 was detected in 13 locations and Legionella pneumophila sg 1 in 11 locations. Therefore, our study concludes that the presence of Legionella pneumophila and Legionella non-pneumophila species in these systems can be a potential threat to public health and should be examined thoroughly with complementary techniques, such as molecular techniques as a screen for routine diagnosis.",10.1016/j.watres.2021.117013,"[{'lastname': 'Salinas', 'firstname': 'Mireya Beatriz', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Fenoy', 'firstname': 'Soledad', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Magnet', 'firstname': 'Angela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Vaccaro', 'firstname': 'Lucianna', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Gomes', 'firstname': 'Thiago Ds', 'initials': 'TD', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Hurtado', 'firstname': 'Carolina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Ollero', 'firstname': 'Dolores', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Valdivieso', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Del Águila', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Pozuelo', 'firstname': 'María José', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.'}, {'lastname': 'Izquierdo', 'firstname': 'Fernando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Urbanización Montepríncipe, 28660 Boadilla del Monte, Madrid, España.

33482833,Brewers' spent grain as substrate for dextran biosynthesis by Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides DSM20193 and Weissella confusa A16.,Microbial cell factories,"Lactic acid bacteria can synthesize dextran and oligosaccharides with different functionality, depending on the strain and fermentation conditions. As natural structure-forming agent, dextran has proven useful as food additive, improving the properties of several raw materials with poor technological quality, such as cereal by-products, fiber-and protein-rich matrices, enabling their use in food applications. In this study, we assessed dextran biosynthesis in situ during fermentation of brewers´ spent grain (BSG), the main by-product of beer brewing industry, with Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides DSM20193 and Weissella confusa A16. The starters performance and the primary metabolites formed during 24 h of fermentation with and without 4% sucrose (w/w) were followed.
The starters showed similar growth and acidification kinetics, but different sugar utilization, especially in presence of sucrose. Viscosity increase in fermented BSG containing sucrose occurred first after 10 h, and it kept increasing until 24 h concomitantly with dextran formation. Dextran content after 24 h was approximately 1% on the total weight of the BSG. Oligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization were formed together with dextran from 10 to 24 h. Three dextransucrase genes were identified in L. pseudomesenteroides DSM20193, one of which was significantly upregulated and remained active throughout the fermentation time. One dextransucrase gene was identified in W. confusa A16 also showing a typical induction profile, with highest upregulation at 10 h.
Selected lactic acid bacteria starters produced significant amount of dextran in brewers' spent grain while forming oligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization. Putative dextransucrase genes identified in the starters showed a typical induction profile. Formation of dextran and oligosaccharides in BSG during lactic acid bacteria fermentation can be tailored to achieve specific technological properties of this raw material, contributing to its reintegration into the food chain.",10.1186/s12934-021-01515-4,"[{'lastname': 'Koirala', 'firstname': 'Prabin', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food and Nutrition, University of Helsinki, 00014, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Maina', 'firstname': 'Ndegwa Henry', 'initials': 'NH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food and Nutrition, University of Helsinki, 00014, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Nihtilä', 'firstname': 'Hanna', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food and Nutrition, University of Helsinki, 00014, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Katina', 'firstname': 'Kati', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food and Nutrition, University of Helsinki, 00014, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Coda', 'firstname': 'Rossana', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food and Nutrition, University of Helsinki, 00014, Helsinki, Finland. rossana.coda@helsinki.fi.\nHelsinki Institute of Sustainability Science, Helsinki, Finland. rossana.coda@helsinki.fi.'}]"

33288171,Isolation and characterization of indigenous Weissella confusa for in situ bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) production in chickpea sourdough.,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","Legume-based sourdough represents a potential ingredient for the manufacture of novel baked products. However, the lack of gluten of legume flours can restrict their use due to their poor technological properties. To overcome such issue, the in situ production of bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) during fermentation has been proposed. In this study, an EPS-producing lactic acid bacteria for in situ production in chickpea sourdough was isolated. After several backsloppings of the spontaneously fermented chickpea flour dough, a dominant strain of Weissella confusa was isolated and identified. W. confusa Ck15 was able to produce linear dextran with 2.6% α-(1 → 3) linked branches, from sucrose. Temperature of 30 °C, dough yield of 333, and 2% of sucrose addition were used to produce fermented chickpea sourdoughs. The acidification and rheology of the sourdoughs inoculated with W. confusa Ck15, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides DSM 20193, as positive control, and Lactobacillus plantarum F8, as negative control, were compared. The in situ dextran production by W. confusa Ck15 fermentation led to the highest viscosity increase (5.90 Pa·s) and the highest EPS percentage in the doughs (1.49%), compared to the other doughs. The in situ dextran production represents a potential approach for improving the use of legume flour in bakery products; overall, this experiment represents a first step for the exploitation of microbial EPS for setting up a baking process for chickpea based product.",10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109785,"[{'lastname': 'Galli', 'firstname': 'Viola', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Agriculture, Food, Environment and Forestry (DAGRI) University of Florence, Piazzale delle Cascine n. 18, Florence, Italy.

33233071,Study of kefir drinks produced by backslopping method using kefir grains from Bosnia and Herzegovina: Microbial dynamics and volatilome profile.,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","Kefir is a well-known health-promoting beverage that can be produced by using kefir grains (traditional method) or by using natural starter cultures from kefir (backslopping method). The aim of this study was to elucidate the microbial dynamics and volatilome profile occurring during kefir production through traditional and backslopping methods by using five kefir grains that were collected in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The results from conventional pour plating techniques and amplicon-based sequencing were combined. The kefir drinks have also been characterized in terms of their physico-chemical and colorimetric parameters. A bacterial shift from Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens to Acetobacter syzygii, Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides from kefir grains in traditional kefir to backslopped kefir was generally observed. Despite some differences within samples, the dominant mycobiota of backslopped kefir samples remained quite similar to that of the kefir grain samples. However, unlike the lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria, the yeast counts decreased progressively from the grains to the backslopped kefir. The backslopped kefir samples showed higher protein, lactose and ash content and lower ethanol content compared to traditional kefir samples, coupled with optimal pH values that contribute to a pleasant sensory profile. Concerning the volatilome, backslopped kefir samples were correlated with cheesy, buttery, floral and fermented odors, whereas the traditional kefir samples were correlated with alcoholic, fruity, fatty and acid odors. Overall, the data obtained in the present study provided evidence that different kefir production methods (traditional vs backslopping) affect the quality characteristics of the final product. Hence, the functional traits of backslopped kefir should be further investigated in order to verify the suitability of a potential scale-up methodology for backslopping.",10.1016/j.foodres.2020.109369,"[{'lastname': 'Garofalo', 'firstname': 'Cristiana', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie, Alimentari ed Ambientali, Università Politecnica delle Marche, Via Brecce Bianche, 60131 Ancona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferrocino', 'firstname': 'Ilario', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'DISAFA - Microbiology and Food Technology Sector, University of Turin, Largo Paolo Braccini, 2, 10095 Grugliasco, Torino, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Reale', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Istituto di Scienze dell'Alimentazione, CNR, Via Roma 64, 83100 Avellino, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Sabbatini', 'firstname': 'Riccardo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie, Alimentari ed Ambientali, Università Politecnica delle Marche, Via Brecce Bianche, 60131 Ancona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Milanović', 'firstname': 'Vesna', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie, Alimentari ed Ambientali, Università Politecnica delle Marche, Via Brecce Bianche, 60131 Ancona, Italy.

33825272,"Cascading effects of composts and cover crops on soil chemistry, bacterial communities and the survival of foodborne pathogens.",Journal of applied microbiology,"Recent foodborne disease outbreaks have caused farmers to re-evaluate their practices. In particular, concern that soil amendments could introduce foodborne pathogens onto farms and promote their survival in soils has led farmers to reduce or eliminate the application of animal-based composts. However, organic amendments (such as composts and cover crops) could bolster food safety by increasing soil microbial diversity and activity, which can act as competitors or antagonists and reduce pathogen survival.
Leveraging a study of a 27-year experiment comparing organic and conventional soil management, we evaluate the impacts of composted poultry litter and cover crops on soil chemistry, bacterial communities and survival of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes. We found that bacterial community composition strongly affected pathogen survival in soils. Specifically, organic soils managed with cover crops and composts hosted more macronutrients and bacterial communities that were better able to suppress Salmonella and Listeria. For example, after incubating soils for 10 days at 20°C, soils without composts retained fourfold to fivefold more Salmonella compared to compost-amended soils. However, treatment effects dissipated as bacterial communities converged over the growing season.
Our results suggest that composts and cover crops may be used to build healthy soils without increasing foodborne pathogen survival.
Our work suggests that animal-based composts do not promote pathogen survival and may even promote bacterial communities that suppress pathogens. Critically, proper composting techniques are known to reduce pathogen populations in biological soil amendments of animal origin, which can reduce the risks of introducing pathogens to farm fields in soil amendments. Thus, animal-based composts and cover crops may be a safe alternative to conventional fertilizers, both because of the known benefits of composts for soil health and because it may be possible to apply amendments in such a way that food-safety risks are mitigated rather than exacerbated.",10.1111/jam.15054,"[{'lastname': 'Devarajan', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McGarvey', 'firstname': 'J A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Albany, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Scow', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'M S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Entomology, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA.\nTree Fruit Research and Extension Center, Washington State University, Wenatchee, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Albany, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Samaddar', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Land, Air and Water Resources, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tran', 'firstname': 'T D', 'initials': 'TD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Karp', 'firstname': 'D S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.'}]"

33826047,Expression of novel acidic lipase from Micrococcus luteus in Pichia pastoris and its application in transesterification.,"Journal, genetic engineering & biotechnology","Lipases are promising biocatalysts for industrial applications and attract attention to be explored. A novel acidic lipase has been isolated from the lipolytic bacteria Micrococcus luteus EMP48-D (LipEMP48-D) screened from tempeh. The lipase gene had previously been overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21, but the expression level obtained was relatively low. Here, to improve the expression level, the lipase gene was cloned to Pichia pastoris. We eliminated the native signal sequence of M. luteus and replaced it with α-mating factor (α-MF) signal sequence. We also optimized and synthesized the lipase gene based on codon preference in P. pastoris.
LipEMP48-D lipase was expressed as an extracellular protein. Codon optimization has been conducted for 20 codons, with the codon adaption index reaching 0.995. The highest extracellular lipase activity obtained reached 145.4 ± 4.8 U/mg under AOX1 promoter in P. pastoris KM71 strain, which was 9.7-fold higher than the previous activity in E. coli. LipEMP48-D showed the highest specific activity at pH 5.0 and stable within the pH range 3.0-5.0 at 40 °C. LipEMP48-D also has the capability of hydrolyzing various long-chain triglycerides, particularly olive oil (100%) followed by sunflower oil (88.5%).

33823212,Mitochondria are essential for antibacterial extracellular trap formation mediated by zymosan in hemocytes of Ruditapes philippinarum.,Developmental and comparative immunology,"The formation of extracellular traps (ETs) is an important innate immune mechanism that serves to combat different invading pathogens. In this study, zymosan significantly induced the formation of ETs in the hemocytes of Ruditapes philippinarum, and this effect was accompanied by translocation of the mitochondria to the cell surface. Zymosan stimulation clearly induced an increase in intracellular ROS and MPO production and an overexpression of ROS-related genes (PI3K, AKT and HIF). In response to the ROS burst, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opened. Conversely, mitochondrial superoxide inhibitor (Mito-TEMPO) significantly inhibited the formation of ETs, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS were necessary for the formation of ETs. In addition, we found that zymosan-induced ETs showed antibacterial activities against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, such as Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio harveyi, Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus. Taken together, these findings elucidated a new antibacterial approach for R. philippinarum and highlighted the role of mitochondria in the formation of zymosan-induced ETs.",10.1016/j.dci.2021.104094,"[{'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Yijing', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, Shandong, 264003, PR China; Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, Shandong, 264003, PR China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Qianqian', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, Shandong, 264003, PR China; Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, Shandong, 264003, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Lizhu', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Shandong Marine Resource and Environment Research Institute, Yantai, Shandong, 264006, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Dinglong', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Muping Coastal Environment Research Station, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, Shandong, 264003, PR China; Research and Development Center for Efficient Utilization of Coastal Bioresources, Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, Shandong, 264003, PR China.

33765627,Electrospun nanofibers enhance trehalose synthesis by regulating gene expression for Micrococcus luteus fermentation.,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces","In this study, mesoporous polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) blended nanofibers were prepared to immobilize Micrococcus luteus for enhancing the conversion of trehalose. The images of SEM showed the cells were adsorbed on the surface and pores due to the unique pore structure. The results of contact angle, Zeta potential and water holding ratio exhibited the good hydrophilicity and stability of PAN/TPU-P2. Besides, it was indicated that the biomass and immobilization efficiency were increased to 0.633 g/L and 0.153 g/g, respectively. It was the most noteworthy that the trehalose yield could reach 23.46 g/L, which was 71.62 % higher than that of the control in the multi-batch fermentation. Moreover, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was decreased to 12.8 % while the enzyme concentration was increased to 11.176 mg/mL. Meanwhile, it was also found that PAN/TPU-P2 immobilization substantially increased the expression of target gene MtreY by 3.500 times. In other words, the mechanism by which immobilized cells increased trehalose yield was that PAN/TPU-P regulated gene expression of MtreY. Therefore, this research provided theoretical foundation for the metabolic regulation of sufficient trehalose production by immobilized cells.",10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.111714,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Le', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Wheat & Corn Further Processing, College of Biological Engineering, Henan University of Technology, 450001, Zhengzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sha', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Wheat & Corn Further Processing, College of Biological Engineering, Henan University of Technology, 450001, Zhengzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fan', 'firstname': 'Yalin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Wheat & Corn Further Processing, College of Biological Engineering, Henan University of Technology, 450001, Zhengzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Ying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'National Engineering Laboratory for Wheat & Corn Further Processing, College of Biological Engineering, Henan University of Technology, 450001, Zhengzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Dapeng', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Environment, Henan Normal University, 453001, Xinxiang, China.

33836129,Bronchiectasis among Australian Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients in the regional and remote population of the Northern Territory of Australia.,Rural and remote health,"Chronic respiratory disorders are highly prevalent among Australian Aboriginal people living in the Top End Health Service region in the Northern Territory, Australia. Bronchiectasis is a heterogenous disease that features among these chronic respiratory conditions in this population. However, there are sparse comparative data between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis from this region.
In this retrospective study, demographics, clinical characteristics and relevant laboratory parameters were compared among adult Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2012 and 2017.
A total of 388 adults had radiology-confirmed bronchiectasis and 258 (66%) were Aboriginal. Compared to non-Aboriginal patients, Aboriginal patients were significantly younger (mean age 54 v 67 years), the majority lived in rural and remote communities (80% v 9 %), had higher rates of self-reported smoking (52% v 19%), alcohol consumption (29% v 12%) and co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (65% v 38%) and other chronic co-morbidities. Sputum microbiology was also different between the groups with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis being more common in Aboriginal patients, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus species and non-tuberculous mycobacteria were higher in non-Aboriginal patients. Further, Aboriginal patients had poorer lung function compared to non-Aboriginal patients (forced expiratory volume after 1 second predicted 33% v 53%, forced vital capacity predicted 49% v 60% respectively), higher exacerbation rates (29% v 18%) and poorer overall outcomes (age at death 60 v 76 years).
Within a single health service, Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis have significantly poorer outcomes with differing manifestations and higher comorbidities than non-Aboriginal patients. This warrants further studies to identify feasible interventions to reduce this inequity.",10.22605/RRH6390,"[{'lastname': 'Mehra', 'firstname': 'Sumit', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; and Department of Pulmonary Physiology and Sleep Medicine, Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia dr.sumitmehra1@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Anne B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': ""Child Health Division, Menzies School of Health Research, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Queensland Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; and Center of Children's Health Research, Australian Centre For Health Services Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia anne.chang@menzies.edu.au.""}, {'lastname': 'Lam', 'firstname': 'Chor K', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; and College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia lammaree@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'Stuart', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; Department of General Medicine, Gold Coast University Hospital, Southport, Queensland, Australia; and School of Medicine, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia stuartc345@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Mingi', 'firstname': 'Joy J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Charles Darwin University, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; and Darwin Respiratory and Sleep Health, Darwin Private Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia joyjjose@yahoo.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Izaak', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia izaakh.thomas@nt.gov.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Harwood', 'firstname': 'Suzanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia suzanne.harwood@malala.com.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Maguire', 'firstname': 'Graeme', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Melbourne Medical School, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia graeme.maguire@wh.org.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Heraganahally', 'firstname': 'Subash', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; and Darwin Respiratory and Sleep Health, Darwin Private Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia hssubhashcmc@hotmail.com.'}]"

To examine the associations of early life nasal and nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage with eczema phenotypes, and the direction of any associations identified.
Among 996 subjects of a population-based prospective cohort study, nasal swabs for Staphylococcus  aureus, and nasopharyngeal swabs for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were collected and cultured from age 6 weeks to 6 years.

The latter may vary in different geographic areas according to prescription profiles and vaccination programs. Beta-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides are the most commonly used antimicrobials during the exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and community-acquired pneumonia. In their prescription, different aspects such as intrinsic activity, bactericidal effect or their ability to prevent the development of resistance must be taken into account. The latter is related to the PK/PD parameters, the mutant prevention concentration and the so-called selection window. More recently, the potential ecological impact has grown in importance, not only on the intestinal microbiota, but also on the respiratory one. Maintaining the state of eubiosis requires the use of antimicrobials with a low profile of action on anaerobic bacteria.

Adenoid biopsy and nasopharyngeal aspirate bacteriology were assessed by conventional culture. Demographic and environmental data were collected by questionnaire. Statistical analyses for descriptive, comparison and logistic regression tests between microbial, demographic, environmental and clinical groups were applied.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were detected in 38, 38, 35 and 24% of cases, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae was an independent determinant for non-typeable H. influenzae and S. aureus colonisation, and S. aureus was an independent determinant for S. pneumoniae colonisation. The nasopharyngeal aspirate otopathogen cultures were strong predictors for otopathogens in the adenoid, with moderate-high test accuracy for all otopathogens (receiver operator characteristics area under the curve ranging from 71 to 97% for the otopathogens tested). Children with positive non-typeable H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus nasopharyngeal aspirate cultures were more likely to have the equivalent species in adenoid cultures (positive likelihood ratios = undefined, 15.0, 9.09 and 5.85, respectively).
This study provides evidence that nasopharyngeal aspirate cultures are an indicator of otopathogens in the adenoid. Nasopharyngeal aspirate cultures may provide clinicians with information that informs clinical management. Strategies for improved management to reduce otopathogen carriage could reduce the prevalence of chronic upper respiratory infections that contribute to adenoidectomy.",10.1111/jpc.15370,"[{'lastname': 'Browne', 'firstname': 'Jessica J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Health, Medical and Applied Sciences, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia.\nSchool of Health and Human Sciences, Southern Cross University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Matthews', 'firstname': 'Evan H', 'initials': 'EH', 'affiliation': 'Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Mater Misericordiae Rockhampton Hospital, Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Taylor-Robinson', 'firstname': 'Andrew W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': 'School of Health, Medical and Applied Sciences, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kyd', 'firstname': 'Jennelle M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Griffith Health, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.'}]"
32831012,Sequencing of five poultry strains elucidates phylogenetic relationships and divergence in virulence genes in Morganella morganii.,BMC genomics,"M. morganii is a bacterium frequently associated with urinary infections in humans. While many human strains are sequenced, only the genomes of few poultry strains are available. Here, we performed a detailed characterization of five highly resistant Morganella morganii strains isolated in association with Escherichia coli from diseased domestic Austrian poultry flocks, namely geese, turkeys and chicken layers. Additionally, we sequenced the genomes of these strains by NGS and analyzed phylogenetic clustering, resistance and virulence genes in the context of host-specificity.
Two strains were identified to be Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) and one as AmpC beta-lactamases (AMP-C) phenotype, while two were ESBL negative. By integrating the genome sequences of these five poultry strains with all the available M. morganii genomes, we constructed a phylogenetic tree that clearly separates the Morganella genus into two clusters (M1 and M2), which approximately reflect the proposed subspecies classification (morganii and sibonii). Additionally, we found no association between phylogenetic structure and host, suggesting interspecies transmission. All five poultry strains contained genes for resistance to aminocoumarins, beta-lactams, colistin, elfamycins, fluoroquinolones, phenicol, rifampin and tetracycline. A comparative genomics analysis of virulence genes showed acquisition of novel virulence genes involved in secretion system and adherence in cluster M2. We showed that some of these genes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer from closely related Morganellaceae species and propose that novel virulence genes could be responsible for expansion of tissue tropism in M. morganii. Finally, we detected variability in copy number and high sequence divergence in toxin genes and provided evidence for positive selection in insecticidal toxins genes, likely reflecting host-related adaptations.
In summary, this study describes i) the first isolation and characterization of M. morganii from goose and turkey, ii) a large-scale genetic analysis of M. morganii and an attempt to generate a global picture of the M. morganii intraspecific phylogenetic structure.",10.1186/s12864-020-07001-2,"[{'lastname': 'Palmieri', 'firstname': 'Nicola', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Poultry and Fish Medicine, Department for Farm Animals and Veterinary Public Health, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinärplatz 1, 1210, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hess', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Poultry and Fish Medicine, Department for Farm Animals and Veterinary Public Health, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinärplatz 1, 1210, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hess', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Poultry and Fish Medicine, Department for Farm Animals and Veterinary Public Health, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinärplatz 1, 1210, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Alispahic', 'firstname': 'Merima', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinic for Poultry and Fish Medicine, Department for Farm Animals and Veterinary Public Health, University of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinärplatz 1, 1210, Vienna, Austria. merima.alispahic@vetmeduni.ac.at.'}]"

We also gauged hospital staff understanding of ESBLs, the procedures in place to identify, treat and infections containing.
Hospital records from 2016 were analysed and 352 ESBL from several samples types were identified using VITEK® 2 system and by phenotypic confirmation using a disk diffusion test. HCWs attitudes and knowledge were assessed using a paper questionnaire.
The percentage of ESBL isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae(n=148; 42.1%) or Escherichia coli(n=176; 50%), Proteus mirabilis(n=7; 2%), Morganella morganii(n=13; 3.7%), Enterobacter (n=7; 2%) and Citrobacter freundii (n=1; 0.3%). Overall tigecycline susceptibility was 82.2%, however P. mirabilis and M. morganii isolates were uniformly resistant and K. pneumoniae susceptibility levels were significantly lower than for E. coli in urine samples (72.3% v 100%; Chi square=13.76, p=0.0002); for blood samples there was also apparently higher resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates. Overall susceptibility to the carbapenems imipenem, meropenem and ertapenam was high. There were overall high levels of uncertainty among healthcare workers on hospital policies on reporting or prescribing with respect to ESBL-expressing infections.
ESBL control strategies should consider variations among sample types, wards, and antibiotic resistance variability.

33836031,Immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of Ugandan adults who resist versus those who develop latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.,PloS one,"The search for immune correlates of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in humans is limited by the focus on peripheral blood measures. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can safely be done and provides insight into cellular function in the lung where infection is first established. In this study, blood and lung samples were assayed to determine if heavily MTB exposed persons who resist development of latent MTB infection (RSTR) vs those who develop latent MTB infection (LTBI), differ in the make-up of resident BAL innate and adaptive immune cells.
Bronchoscopy was performed on 21 healthy long-term Ugandan RSTR and 25 LTBI participants. Immune cell distributions in BAL and peripheral blood were compared by differential cell counting and flow cytometry.
The bronchoscopy procedure was well tolerated with few adverse reactions. Differential macrophage and lymphocyte frequencies in BAL differed between RSTR and LTBI. When corrected for age, this difference lost statistical significance. BAL CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were almost entirely composed of effector memory T cells in contrast to PBMC, and did not differ between RSTR and LTBI. BAL NKT, γδ T cells and NK cells also did not differ between RTSR and LTBI participants. There was a marginally significant increase (p = 0.034) in CD8 T effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) in PBMC of LTBI vs RSTR participants.
This observational case-control study comparing unstimulated BAL from RSTR vs LTBI, did not find evidence of large differences in the distribution of baseline BAL immune cells. PBMC TEMRA cell percentage was higher in LTBI relative to RSTR suggesting a role in the maintenance of latent MTB infection.

33834319,Affinity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains for M059K microglial cells after migration through A549 alveolar epithelium.,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat worldwide while central nervous system TB (CNS-TB) is one of the most severe forms of extrapulmonary TB. CNS-TB develops as a secondary infection during the hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) from the lungs to the CNS. Factors influencing the dissemination of the bacilli to the CNS have not been studied extensively. This study evaluated the transmigration ability through the alveolar epithelium and adhesion and invasion capacity of glial cells of M. tuberculosis strains of varying drug susceptibility and genotype profiles using an in vitro co-culture model. A549 alveolar epithelial cells and M059K glial cells were co-cultured in a Transwell plate with A549 cells cultured in the upper chamber and M059K glial cells in the lower chamber. A549 epithelial cells were infected with F15/LAM4/KZN (susceptible, MDR, XDR), Beijing (susceptible, XDR), F11 (susceptible), F28 (MDR), and H37Rv strains of M. tuberculosis. The transmigration of an A549 monolayer and subsequent adhesion and invasion rates of M059K cells were established. The susceptible and XDR variants of the F15/LAM4/KZN strain transmigrate the alveolar epithelial cell monolayer more efficiently than the MDR variant. The Beijing-XDR variant showed a high transmigration rate, while the susceptible variant showed no transmigration ability. Similar to the MDR F15/LAM4/KZN, the F28 and F11 strains showed a low dissemination ability. The bacteria were still capable to adhere to M059K glial cells after passage through the A549 cells. We conclude that M. tuberculosis isolates that passed through a monolayer of A549 alveolar epithelium by transcellular migration can still adhere to M059K glial cells. There is no genetic link between resistance and transmigration.","10.1007/s10096-021-04226-1

This study detected resistance-conferring mutations in gyrA/gyrB for fluoroquinolones and rrs/eis genes for second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs) among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates in Kuwait. Fifty pansusceptible M. tuberculosis and 102 MDR-TB strains were tested. Phenotypic susceptibility testing was performed by MGIT 960 system using SIRE drug kit. GenoType MTBDRsl version 1 (gMTBDRslv1) and GenoType MTBDRsl version 2 (gMTBDRslv2) tests were used for mutation detection. Results were validated by PCR-sequencing of respective genes. Fingerprinting was performed by spoligotyping. No mutations were detected in pansusceptible isolates. gMTBDRslv1 detected gyrA mutations in 12 and rrs mutations in 8 MDR-TB isolates. gMTBDRsl2 additionally detected gyrB mutations in 2 and eis mutation in 1 isolate. Mutations in both gyrA/gyrB and rrs/eis were not detected. gMTBDRslv1 also detected ethambutol resistance-conferring embB mutations in 59 isolates. Although XDR-TB was not detected, frequency of resistance-conferring mutations for fluoroquinolones or SLIDs was significantly higher among isolates collected during 2013-2019 versus 2006-2012. Application of both tests is warranted for proper management of MDR-TB patients in Kuwait as gMTBDRslv2 detected resistance to fluoroquinolones and/or SLIDs in 3 additional isolates while gMTBDRslv1 additionally detected resistance to ethambutol in 58% of MDR-TB isolates.","10.1038/s41598-021-87516-0

33825069,The effects of intradermal M. bovis and M. avium PPD test on immune-related mRNA and miRNA in dermal oedema exudates of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).,Tropical animal health and production,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a zoonotic disease primarily caused by pathogens belonging to the genus of Mycobacterium. Programs of control and eradication for bovine TB include a screening using single intradermal tuberculin (SIT) test with Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis)-purified protein derivatives (PPD-B) single or concurrent with Mycobacterium avium (M. avium)-purified protein derivatives (PPD-A). This study aimed to determine the effects of intradermal PPD-B and PPD-A test on immune-related mRNA and microRNAs in dermal oedema exudates of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). The investigation was carried out on RNA extracted from dermal oedema exudates of 36 animals, of which 24 were M. bovis positive (M. bovis+) and 12 M. avium positive (M. avium+). The lymphocyte polarization toward Th1, Th2, TReg, and Th17 lineages was addressed by measuring the abundance of the respective cytokines and transcription factors, namely TBET, STAT4, IFNγ, and IL1β for Th1; STAT5B, and IL4 for Th2; FOXP3 and IL10 for TReg; and RORC, STAT3, and IL17A for Th17. Due to the very low abundance of Th17-related genes, a digital PCR protocol was also applied. The abundance of microRNAs involved in the immune response against PPDs, including miR-122-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR30a, and miR-455-5p, was equally measured. Results showed that IFNγ (fold change = 2.54; p = 0.037) and miR-148a-3p (fold change = 2.54; p = 0.03) were upregulated in M. bovis+ as compared to M. avium+ samples. Our preliminary results supported the pivotal role of IFNγ in the local immune response related to PPD-B and highlighted the differential expression of miR-148a-3p, which downregulates the proinflammatory cytokines and the TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation, providing an anti-inflammation modulator in responses to mycobacterial infection.","10.1007/s11250-021-02696-1

33823816,Comparative genomic analysis of Mycobacterium intracellulare: implications for clinical taxonomic classification in pulmonary Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex disease.,BMC microbiology,"Mycobacterium intracellulare is a representative etiological agent of emerging pulmonary M. avium-intracellulare complex disease in the industrialized countries worldwide. The recent genome sequencing of clinical strains isolated from pulmonary M. avium-intracellulare complex disease has provided insight into the genomic characteristics of pathogenic mycobacteria, especially for M. avium; however, the genomic characteristics of M. intracellulare remain to be elucidated.
In this study, we performed comparative genomic analysis of 55 M. intracellulare and related strains such as M. paraintracellulare (MP), M. indicus pranii (MIP) and M. yonogonense. Based on the average nucleotide identity, the clinical M. intracellulare strains were phylogenetically grouped in two clusters: (1) the typical M. intracellulare (TMI) group, including ATCC13950 and virulent M.i.27 and M.i.198 that we previously reported, and (2) the MP-MIP group. The alignment of the genomic regions was mostly preserved between groups. Plasmids were identified between groups and subgroups, including a plasmid common among some strains of the M.i.27 subgroup. Several genomic regions including those encoding factors involved in lipid metabolism (e.g., fadE3, fadE33), transporters (e.g., mce3), and type VII secretion system (genes of ESX-2 system) were shown to be hypermutated in the clinical strains. M. intracellulare was shown to be pan-genomic at the species and subspecies levels. The mce genes were specific to particular subspecies, suggesting that these genes may be helpful in discriminating virulence phenotypes between subspecies.
Our data suggest that genomic diversity among M. intracellulare, M. paraintracellulare, M. indicus pranii and M. yonogonense remains at the subspecies or genovar levels and does not reach the species level. Genetic components such as mce genes revealed by the comparative genomic analysis could be the novel focus for further insight into the mechanism of human pathogenesis for M. intracellulare and related strains.","10.1186/s12866-021-02163-9

33822156,"SEROPREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM SUBSP. PARATUBERCULOSIS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO AGE AND SEX OF TEXAS WHITE-TAILED DEER (ODOCOILEUS VIRGINIANUS) IN COAHUILA, MEXICO.",Journal of wildlife diseases,"Paratuberculosis (PTB) is a disease that affects cattle (Bos taurus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), and wild animals, such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), since all ruminants are susceptible. The causal agent is Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The disease is chronic, consumptive, and incurable; it causes chronic granulomatous gastroenteritis with lymphangiectasis and lymphangitis leading to a syndrome of malnutrition and eventually to death. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis is transmitted in feces mainly orally; however, it can also be transmitted vertically. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of MAP antibodies and its relationship to age and sex of Texas white-tailed deer in the subclinical stage of PTB in Coahuila, Mexico. The entire population (n=99) belonging to the Wildlife Management and Conservation Unit (WMCU) San Juan, Monclova, Coahuila, Mexico was captured. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis was diagnosed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by serologic test. Seroprevalence variables of adult vs. young females and males vs. females were compared. The treatments were assigned at random. For the analysis of data, the chi-square test was used. Total seroprevalence in an intensive WMCU was 16% (16/99). Total seroprevalence by sex was 5.0% (5/99) for males and 11% (11/99) for females, and total seroprevalence by age was 7% (7/99) for young and 9% (9/99) for adult. Within sex, the seroprevalence in males was 16% (5/31) and 16% (11/68) in females. There were no statistical differences for any of the comparisons. Total seroprevalence of the white-tailed deer population in the WMCU was 16%, and PTB seroprevalence was independent of sex or age of the sampled individuals of this population.",10.7589/JWD-D-20-00045,"[{'lastname': 'Lozano-Cavazos', 'firstname': 'E Alejandro', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Recursos Naturales Renovables, Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro, Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, 25315.'}, {'lastname': 'Velázquez-Morales', 'firstname': 'J Vicente', 'initials': 'JV', 'affiliation': 'Programa de Ganadería, Campus Montecillo, Colegio de Postgraduados (ColPos), Km 36.5 Carretera México-Texcoco, Montecillo, Texcoco, Mexico, 56230.'}, {'lastname': 'Santillán-Flores', 'firstname': 'Marco A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Centro Nacional de Investigación Disciplinaria en Microbiología Animal (CENID-Microbiología), Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias (INIFAP), Km. 15.5 Carretera México-Toluca, Palo Alto, Cuajimalpa, Mexico, 05110.'}, {'lastname': 'Tarango-Arámbula', 'firstname': 'Luis A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Posgrado en Innovación en Manejo de Recursos Naturales, Campus SLP, Colegio de Postgraduados (ColPos), Iturbide 73, Salinas de Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, Mexico, 78600.'}, {'lastname': 'Olmos-Oropeza', 'firstname': 'Genaro', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Posgrado en Innovación en Manejo de Recursos Naturales, Campus SLP, Colegio de Postgraduados (ColPos), Iturbide 73, Salinas de Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, Mexico, 78600.'}, {'lastname': 'Martínez-Montoya', 'firstname': 'J Felipe', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': 'Posgrado en Innovación en Manejo de Recursos Naturales, Campus SLP, Colegio de Postgraduados (ColPos), Iturbide 73, Salinas de Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, Mexico, 78600.'}, {'lastname': 'Cortez-Romero', 'firstname': 'César', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Programa de Ganadería, Campus Montecillo, Colegio de Postgraduados (ColPos), Km 36.5 Carretera México-Texcoco, Montecillo, Texcoco, Mexico, 56230.\nPosgrado en Innovación en Manejo de Recursos Naturales, Campus SLP, Colegio de Postgraduados (ColPos), Iturbide 73, Salinas de Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, Mexico, 78600.'}]"

Tuberculosis has been reported a serious complication in leukemia patients who undergo chemotherapy. The study was focused to find mutations in hupB gene of M. tuberculosis in 50 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients through semi multi complex PCR. A column based DNA isolation method was adopted for DNA isolation. The gene for histone-like protein (hupB [Rv2986c]) of M tuberculosis was amplified to detect two closely related mycobacterial species. Primers M and S (histone like protein HupB) were utilized to generate amplicons of 318 bp and 291 bp for M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, respectively. Out of fifty ALL patients, 21 (42%) were females and 29 (58%) were males. The prevalence of ALL was found higher in males as compared to females. The prevalence of ALL was higher in patients of age group 5-10 years. The results of the amplification showed that, the 318 bp fragment specific for M. tuberculosis was observed in seven samples (14%), while 291 bp fragment specific for M. bovis was not observed in any sample. Children with ALL were found at higher risk for tuberculosis. A risk evaluation of tuberculosis infection must be conducted before managing chemotherapy.",,"[{'lastname': 'Mahmood', 'firstname': 'Nasir', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, Human Genetics and Molecular Biology, University of Health Sciences (UHS), Lahore, Pakistan & Department of Cell and System Biology, University of Toronto, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Abbas', 'firstname': 'Shahzada Nadeem', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Lahore Garrison University, Lahore, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nazeer', 'firstname': 'Qurat Ul Ain', 'initials': 'QUA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Manzoor', 'firstname': 'Iqra', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Lahore Garrison University, Lahore, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shahid', 'firstname': 'Saman', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sciences & Humanities, National University of Computer & Emerging Sciences (NUCES), FAST, Lahore, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Majeed', 'firstname': 'Asma', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Environmental Sciences, University College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan.'}]"
33827617,Local immune responses to tuberculin skin challenge in Mycobacterium bovis BCG-vaccinated baboons: a pilot study of younger and older animals.,Immunity & ageing : I & A,"Individuals over the age of 65 are highly susceptible to infectious diseases, which account for one-third of deaths in this age group. Vaccines are a primary tool to combat infection, yet they are less effective in the elderly population. While many groups have aimed to address this problem by studying vaccine-induced peripheral blood responses in the elderly, work from our lab and others demonstrate that immune responses to vaccination and infectious challenge may differ between tissue sites and the periphery. In this pilot study, we established an in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity model of Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination and tuberculin skin test in two adult and two aged baboons. Vaccination generates BCG-specific immune cells that are recruited to the skin upon tuberculin challenge. We tested short term recall responses (8 weeks post-vaccination) and long term recall responses (25 weeks post-vaccination) by performing skin punch biopsies around the site of tuberculin injection. In short term recall responses, we found increased oxidation and decreased production of immune proteins in aged baboon skin at the site of TST challenge, in comparison to adult skin. Differences between adult and aged animals normalized in the long term response to tuberculin. In vitro, aged peripheral blood mononuclear cells had increased migration and functional responses to antigen-specific stimulation, suggesting that age-related changes in the tissue in vivo impairs aged immune recall responses to antigenic challenge. These findings highlight the impact of age-associated changes in the local tissue environment in memory recall responses, which may be more broadly applied to the study of other tissues. Moreover, these findings should be considered in future studies aimed at understanding and improving aging immune responses to vaccination and tissue challenge.","10.1186/s12979-021-00229-w

33827573,Spoligotype-specific risk of finding lesions in tissues from cattle infected by Mycobacterium bovis.,BMC veterinary research,"Although the pathogenic effect of members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in susceptible hosts is well known, differences in clinical signs and pathological findings observed in infected animals have been reported, likely due to a combination of host and pathogen-related factors. Here, we investigated whether Mycobacterium bovis strains belonging to different spoligotypes were associated with a higher risk of occurrence of visible/more severe lesions in target organs (lungs and/or lymph nodes) from infected animals. A large collection of 8889 samples belonging to cattle were classified depending on the presence/absence of tuberculosis-like lesions and its degree of severity. All samples were subjected to culture irrespective of the presence of lesions, and isolates retrieved were identified and subjected to spoligotyping. The association between the presence/severity of the lesions and the isolation of strains from a given spoligotype was assessed using non-parametric tests and Bayesian mixed multivariable logistic regression models that accounted for origin (region and herd) effects.
Results suggested a difference in severity in lesioned samples depending on the strain's spoligotype. An association between specific spoligotypes and presence of lesions was observed, with a higher risk of finding lesions in animals infected with strains with spoligotypes SB0120, SB0295 and SB1142 compared with SB0121, and in those coming from certain regions in Spain.
Our results suggest that strains belonging to certain spoligotypes may be associated with a higher probability in the occurrence of gross/macroscopic lesions in infected cattle, although these observational findings should be confirmed in further studies that allow accounting for the effect of other possible confounders not considered here, and ultimately through experimental studies.","10.1186/s12917-021-02848-3

33825069,The effects of intradermal M. bovis and M. avium PPD test on immune-related mRNA and miRNA in dermal oedema exudates of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).,Tropical animal health and production,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a zoonotic disease primarily caused by pathogens belonging to the genus of Mycobacterium. Programs of control and eradication for bovine TB include a screening using single intradermal tuberculin (SIT) test with Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis)-purified protein derivatives (PPD-B) single or concurrent with Mycobacterium avium (M. avium)-purified protein derivatives (PPD-A). This study aimed to determine the effects of intradermal PPD-B and PPD-A test on immune-related mRNA and microRNAs in dermal oedema exudates of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). The investigation was carried out on RNA extracted from dermal oedema exudates of 36 animals, of which 24 were M. bovis positive (M. bovis+) and 12 M. avium positive (M. avium+). The lymphocyte polarization toward Th1, Th2, TReg, and Th17 lineages was addressed by measuring the abundance of the respective cytokines and transcription factors, namely TBET, STAT4, IFNγ, and IL1β for Th1; STAT5B, and IL4 for Th2; FOXP3 and IL10 for TReg; and RORC, STAT3, and IL17A for Th17. Due to the very low abundance of Th17-related genes, a digital PCR protocol was also applied. The abundance of microRNAs involved in the immune response against PPDs, including miR-122-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR30a, and miR-455-5p, was equally measured. Results showed that IFNγ (fold change = 2.54; p = 0.037) and miR-148a-3p (fold change = 2.54; p = 0.03) were upregulated in M. bovis+ as compared to M. avium+ samples. Our preliminary results supported the pivotal role of IFNγ in the local immune response related to PPD-B and highlighted the differential expression of miR-148a-3p, which downregulates the proinflammatory cytokines and the TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation, providing an anti-inflammation modulator in responses to mycobacterial infection.","10.1007/s11250-021-02696-1

33770235,Parvovirus B19 and mumps virus antibodies are major constituents of the intrathecal immune response in European patients with MS and increase the diagnostic sensitivity and discriminatory power of the MRZ reaction.,Journal of neurology,"A positive MRZ reaction, as defined by intrathecal IgG production against at least two of its constituents, measles virus (M), rubella virus (R) and varicella zoster virus (Z), is detectable in ~ 63% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is currently considered the laboratory marker with the highest specificity and positive likelihood ratio for MS. However, M, R and Z are only the most well-established constituents of a broader intrathecal humoral immune response in MS.
To identify additional anti-microbial antibodies inclusion of which in the classical MRZ panel may result in increased sensitivity without compromising the marker's high specificity for MS.
We determined the antibody indices (AIs) for 11 viral and bacterial agents (M, R, Z, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, mumps virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Clostridium tetani) in paired cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples from patients with MS and disease controls.
A positive 'classical' MRZ reaction was found in 17/26 (65.4%) MS patients. The five most frequently positive AIs among patients with MS were M (76.9%), Z (61.5%), R (57.7%), parvovirus B19 (42.3%), and mumps (28%). Addition of parvovirus B19 and mumps virus to the MRZ panel resulted in an increase in sensitivity in the MS group from 65.4% to 73.1%, with 22% of the initially MRZ-negative patients exhibiting a de novo-positive response. The extended MRZ panel ('MRZplus') distinguished sharply between MS (≥ 3 AIs in 90% of all positives) and controls (varying diagnoses, from migraine to vasculitis; 0-1 AIs; p < 0.000001). The highest median AI in the MS group was found for parvovirus B19 (3.97), followed by measles virus (2.79).
Inclusion of parvovirus B19 and mumps virus in the test panel resulted in an increase in the sensitivity and discriminatory power of MRZ. Our results provide a strong rational for prospective studies investigating the role of extended MRZ panels in the differential diagnosis of MS.","10.1007/s00415-021-10471-3

33823816,Comparative genomic analysis of Mycobacterium intracellulare: implications for clinical taxonomic classification in pulmonary Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex disease.,BMC microbiology,"Mycobacterium intracellulare is a representative etiological agent of emerging pulmonary M. avium-intracellulare complex disease in the industrialized countries worldwide. The recent genome sequencing of clinical strains isolated from pulmonary M. avium-intracellulare complex disease has provided insight into the genomic characteristics of pathogenic mycobacteria, especially for M. avium; however, the genomic characteristics of M. intracellulare remain to be elucidated.
In this study, we performed comparative genomic analysis of 55 M. intracellulare and related strains such as M. paraintracellulare (MP), M. indicus pranii (MIP) and M. yonogonense. Based on the average nucleotide identity, the clinical M. intracellulare strains were phylogenetically grouped in two clusters: (1) the typical M. intracellulare (TMI) group, including ATCC13950 and virulent M.i.27 and M.i.198 that we previously reported, and (2) the MP-MIP group. The alignment of the genomic regions was mostly preserved between groups. Plasmids were identified between groups and subgroups, including a plasmid common among some strains of the M.i.27 subgroup. Several genomic regions including those encoding factors involved in lipid metabolism (e.g., fadE3, fadE33), transporters (e.g., mce3), and type VII secretion system (genes of ESX-2 system) were shown to be hypermutated in the clinical strains. M. intracellulare was shown to be pan-genomic at the species and subspecies levels. The mce genes were specific to particular subspecies, suggesting that these genes may be helpful in discriminating virulence phenotypes between subspecies.
Our data suggest that genomic diversity among M. intracellulare, M. paraintracellulare, M. indicus pranii and M. yonogonense remains at the subspecies or genovar levels and does not reach the species level. Genetic components such as mce genes revealed by the comparative genomic analysis could be the novel focus for further insight into the mechanism of human pathogenesis for M. intracellulare and related strains.","10.1186/s12866-021-02163-9

Immunomagnetic beads were prepared by using purified antibodies from hyperimmunized sera that were coupled to Fe nanoparticles with diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) or ethyl (dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC)-N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) as linkers. Rhodamine hydrazone particles were synthesized and coupled to IgY anti-MAP antibodies using DTPA or EDC-NHS linkers. Separation efficiency of the IMB was tested on bovine fecal, milk, and colostrum samples experimentally contaminated with MAP. The studied methods were evaluated on their ability to detect MAP and separate bacteria in complex mediums. The ELISA results indicated 95% efficacy in antibody coupling to IMB, with the DTPA-IMB method being more efficient than the EDC-NHS-IMB method. By using the DTPA-IMB method, MAP bacteria were successfully recovered from fecal, milk, and colostrum samples. The DTPA-IMB method used in combination with the rhodamine hydrazone immunosensor had a limit of detection equal to 30 and 30,000 MAP cells/mL using chromogenic and fluorescent properties, respectively. Combining the DTPA-IMB separation method with the rhodamine hydrazone immunosensor provides a fast, sensitive, and cost-beneficial method for detecting MAP in bovine feces, milk, and colostrum.",10.3168/jds.2020-18819,"[{'lastname': 'Khosravi', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahvaz 6135783151, Iran.

We consecutively included patients during the first peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and analyzed the expressions of genes encoding interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12A, IL-12B, and tumor necrosis factor-α in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We included 64 leprosy patients and 50 controls. Twelve of the leprosy patients and 14 of the controls had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Co-infection was associated with increased IL-6 (P = 0.043) and IL-12B (P = 0.017) expression. The median disability grades were higher for leprosy/COVID-19 patients; however, the difference was not significant (P = 0.194).

33770127,Mycobacterium leprae promotes triacylglycerol de novo synthesis through induction of GPAT3 expression in human premonocytic THP-1 cells.,PloS one,"Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) is the etiological agent of leprosy, and the skin lesions of lepromatous leprosy are filled with numerous foamy or xanthomatous histiocytes that are parasitized by M. leprae. Lipids are an important nutrient for the intracellular survival of M. leprae. In this study, we attempted to determine the intracellular lipid composition and underlying mechanisms for changes in host cell lipid metabolism induced by M. leprae infection. Using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), we demonstrated specific induction of triacylglycerol (TAG) production in human macrophage THP-1 cells following M. leprae infection. We then used [14C] stearic acid tracing to show incorporation of this newly synthesized host cell TAG into M. leprae. In parallel with TAG accumulation, expression of host glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3 (GPAT3), a key enzyme in de novo TAG synthesis, was significantly increased in M. leprae-infected cells. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of GPAT3 in THP-1 cells (GPAT3 KO) dramatically reduced accumulation of TAG following M. leprae infection, intracellular mycobacterial load, and bacteria viability. These results together suggest that M. leprae induces host GPAT3 expression to facilitate TAG accumulation within macrophages to maintain a suitable environment that is crucial for intracellular survival of these bacilli.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249184,"[{'lastname': 'Tanigawa', 'firstname': 'Kazunari', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayashi', 'firstname': 'Yasuhiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hama', 'firstname': 'Kotaro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamashita', 'firstname': 'Atsushi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yokoyama', 'firstname': 'Kazuaki', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Yuqian', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Medical Technology, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawashima', 'firstname': 'Akira', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Medical Technology, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Maeda', 'firstname': 'Yumi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mycobacteriology, Leprosy Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Higashimurayama-shi, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakamura', 'firstname': 'Yasuhiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Harada', 'firstname': 'Ayako', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiriya', 'firstname': 'Mitsuo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Medical Technology, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Karasawa', 'firstname': 'Ken', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharma-Science, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Koichi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, Faculty of Medical Technology, Teikyo University, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.\nDepartment of Mycobacteriology, Leprosy Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Higashimurayama-shi, Tokyo, Japan.'}]"

33709405,In search of biomarkers for leprosy by unraveling the host immune response to Mycobacterium leprae.,Immunological reviews,"Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, is still actively transmitted in endemic areas reflected by the fairly stable number of new cases detected each year. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of leprosy is challenging, especially at an early stage. Improved diagnostic tools, based on sensitive and specific biomarkers, that facilitate diagnosis of leprosy are therefore urgently needed. In this review, we address the challenges that leprosy biomarker research is facing by reviewing cell types reported to be involved in host immunity to M leprae. These cell types can be associated with different possible fates of M leprae infection being either protective immunity, or pathogenic immune responses inducing nerve damage. Unraveling these responses will facilitate the search for biomarkers. Implications for further studies to disentangle the complex interplay between host responses that lead to leprosy disease are discussed, providing leads for the identification of new biomarkers to improve leprosy diagnostics.",10.1111/imr.12966,"[{'lastname': 'van Hooij', 'firstname': 'Anouk', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Geluk', 'firstname': 'Annemieke', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}]"
33341111,Functional biomarker signatures of circulating T-cells and its association with distinct clinical status of leprosy patients and their respective household contacts.,Infectious diseases of poverty,"Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease classified into two subgroups for therapeutic purposes: paucibacillary (PB) and multibacillary (MB), closely related to the host immune responses. In this context it is noteworthy looking for immunological biomarkers applicable as complementary diagnostic tools as well as a laboratorial strategy to follow-up leprosy household contacts.
The cross-sectional study enrolled 49 participants, including 19 patients and 30 healthy controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated and incubated in the presence of Mycobacterium leprae bacilli. The cells were prepared for surface (CD4
The cytokine signature analysis demonstrated that leprosy patients presented a polyfunctional profile of T-cells subsets, with increased frequency of IFN-γ

32862159,"Effect of dialyzable leukocyte extract, sodium butyrate, and valproic acid in the development of anergy in murine leprosy.",International journal of mycobacteriology,"Murine leprosy is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium lepraemurium (MLM) in mice and rats. The disease evolves with the development of cellular anergy that impedes the production of interferon gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), and nitric oxide (NO) required to kill the microorganism. In this study we investigated whether histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) (valproic acid and sodium butyrate [NaB]) and the immunomodulator transfer factor in dialyzable leukocyte extracts (DLE) can prevent anergy in murine leprosy.
Five groups of six Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with 2 × 107 MLM. Thirty-days post inoculation, treatment was started; one group received no treatment, one was treated with rifampicin-clofazimine (R-C), one with sodium valproate (VPA), one with NaB, and one with DLE. The animals were monitored for the evidence of disease for 96 days. After euthanasia, their spleens were removed and processed for histologic, bacteriologic, and cytokine studies.
R-C completely controlled the ongoing disease. DLE and NaB significantly reduced the development of lesions, including granuloma size and the number of bacilli; VPA was less effective. DLE, NaB, and VPA reverted the anergic condition in diverse grades and allowed the expression of IFNγ, TNFα, and inducible NO synthase, also in diverse grades.
Anergy in leprosy and murine leprosy allows disease progression. In this study, anergy was prevented, in significant degree, by DLE (an immunomodulator) and NaB (HDACi). VPA was less effective. These results suggest potential beneficial effects of DLE and NaB in the ancillary treatment of leprosy.",10.4103/ijmy.ijmy_31_20,"[{'lastname': 'Rojas-Espinosa', 'firstname': 'Oscar', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, National School of Biological Sciences, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Moreno-García', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, National School of Biological Sciences, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Arce-Paredes', 'firstname': 'Patricia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, National School of Biological Sciences, National Polytechnic Institute, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Becerril-Villanueva', 'firstname': 'Erique', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychoimmunology, National Institute of Psychiatry, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Juárez-Ortega', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Technologic University, Campus Los Reyes, Mexico City, Mexico.'}]"

The analysis of genomes belonging to 174 taxa (species or subspecies) of the genus Mycobacterium was conducted using both the Average Nucleotide Identity and the Genome to Genome Distance. A number of synonymous taxa were detected. The list of synonyms includes: two subspecies of M. chelonae (M. chelonae subsp. bovis and M. chelonae subsp. gwanakae), two subspecies of M. fortuitum (M. fortuitum subsp. fortuitum and M. fortuitum subsp. acetamidolyticum), four subspecies of M. avium (M. avium subsp. avium, M. avium subsp. silvaticum, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and ""M. avium subsp. hominissuis""), two couples of subspecies of M. intracellulare (M. intracellulare subsp. intracellulare/M. intracellulare subsp. paraintracellulare and M. intracellulare subsp. chimaera/M. intracellulare subsp. yongonense), the species M. austroafricanum and M. vanbaalenii, the species M. senegalense and M. conceptionense, the species M. talmoniae and M. eburneum and the species M. marinum, M. ulcerans and M. pseudoshottsii. Furthermore one species were reclassified as subspecies of another mycobacterium: M. lepraemurium was reclassified as a subspecies of M. avium (M. avium subsp. lepraemurium). The updates to nomenclature are proposed basing on the priority of names according the Code of nomenclature of prokaryotes. For two species (M. bouchedurhonense and M. marseillense) the loss of standing in nomenclature is proposed because of unavailability of respective type strains in culture collections.",10.1016/j.meegid.2019.103983,"[{'lastname': 'Tortoli', 'firstname': 'Enrico', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.

A new formulation of the Mycobacterium phlei cell wall fraction immunostimulant (Immunocidin Equine) was used to treat cutaneous tumors in horses. Equids with skin tumors diagnosed as sarcoids were enrolled in the study. Sarcoids were injected at the initial visit with Immunocidin Equine and subsequently at approximately 2-week intervals. Of 17 cases, nine cases were completely resolved at the end of the study period evaluation or at the time of final follow-up (52.9%). Three cases were reported as improved (smaller), but not resolved (17.6%). Three cases were discontinued from the study as the respective masses were growing larger or not resolving (17.6%). One case (5.8%) with two masses had resolution of one mass, whereas the other tumor had a small regrowth 5 months after the last treatment. One case (5.8%) was lost to follow-up.

33822039,"Mevo lectin specificity towards high-mannose structures with terminal αMan(1,2)αMan residues and its implication to inhibition of the entry of Mycobacterium tuberculosis into macrophages.",Glycobiology,"Mannose-binding lectins can specifically recognize and bind complex glycan structures on pathogens and have potential as anti-viral and anti-bacterial agents. We previously reported the structure of a lectin from an archaeal species, Mevo lectin, which has specificity towards terminal α1,2 linked manno-oligosaccharides. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) expresses mannosylated structures including, lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) on its surface and exploits C-type lectins to gain entry into the host cells. ManLAM structure has mannose capping with terminal αMan(1,2)αMan residues and is important for recognition by innate immune cells. Here, we aim to address the specificity of Mevo lectin towards high-mannose type glycans with terminal αMan(1,2)αMan residues and its effect on M. tuberculosis internalization by macrophages. ITC studies demonstrated that Mevo lectin shows preferential binding towards manno-oligosaccharides with terminal αMan(1,2)αMan structures, and showed a strong affinity for ManLAM, whereas it binds weakly to Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) lipoarabinomannan (MsmLAM), which displays relatively fewer and shorter mannosyl caps. Crystal structure of Mevo lectin complexed with a Man7D1 revealed the multivalent cross-linking interaction, which explains avidity-based high affinity for these ligands when compared to previously studied manno-oligosaccharides lacking the specific termini. Functional studies suggest that M. tuberculosis internalization by the macrophage was impaired by binding of Mevo lectin to ManLAM present on the surface of M. tuberculosis. Selectivity shown by Mevo lectin towards glycans with terminal αMan(1,2)αMan structures, and its ability to compromise the internalization of M. tuberculosis in vitro, underscore the potential utility of Mevo lectin as a research tool to study host-pathogen interactions.",10.1093/glycob/cwab022,"[{'lastname': 'Sivaji', 'firstname': 'Nukathoti', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Harish', 'firstname': 'Nikitha', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Samsher', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Amit', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Vijayan', 'firstname': 'Mamannamana', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Surolia', 'firstname': 'Avadhesha', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560012, India.'}]"

33834319,Affinity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains for M059K microglial cells after migration through A549 alveolar epithelium.,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat worldwide while central nervous system TB (CNS-TB) is one of the most severe forms of extrapulmonary TB. CNS-TB develops as a secondary infection during the hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) from the lungs to the CNS. Factors influencing the dissemination of the bacilli to the CNS have not been studied extensively. This study evaluated the transmigration ability through the alveolar epithelium and adhesion and invasion capacity of glial cells of M. tuberculosis strains of varying drug susceptibility and genotype profiles using an in vitro co-culture model. A549 alveolar epithelial cells and M059K glial cells were co-cultured in a Transwell plate with A549 cells cultured in the upper chamber and M059K glial cells in the lower chamber. A549 epithelial cells were infected with F15/LAM4/KZN (susceptible, MDR, XDR), Beijing (susceptible, XDR), F11 (susceptible), F28 (MDR), and H37Rv strains of M. tuberculosis. The transmigration of an A549 monolayer and subsequent adhesion and invasion rates of M059K cells were established. The susceptible and XDR variants of the F15/LAM4/KZN strain transmigrate the alveolar epithelial cell monolayer more efficiently than the MDR variant. The Beijing-XDR variant showed a high transmigration rate, while the susceptible variant showed no transmigration ability. Similar to the MDR F15/LAM4/KZN, the F28 and F11 strains showed a low dissemination ability. The bacteria were still capable to adhere to M059K glial cells after passage through the A549 cells. We conclude that M. tuberculosis isolates that passed through a monolayer of A549 alveolar epithelium by transcellular migration can still adhere to M059K glial cells. There is no genetic link between resistance and transmigration.","10.1007/s10096-021-04226-1

33833390,Increasing prevalence of resistance to second-line drugs among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Kuwait.,Scientific reports,"Molecular methods detect genetic mutations associated with drug resistance. This study detected resistance-conferring mutations in gyrA/gyrB for fluoroquinolones and rrs/eis genes for second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs) among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates in Kuwait. Fifty pansusceptible M. tuberculosis and 102 MDR-TB strains were tested. Phenotypic susceptibility testing was performed by MGIT 960 system using SIRE drug kit. GenoType MTBDRsl version 1 (gMTBDRslv1) and GenoType MTBDRsl version 2 (gMTBDRslv2) tests were used for mutation detection. Results were validated by PCR-sequencing of respective genes. Fingerprinting was performed by spoligotyping. No mutations were detected in pansusceptible isolates. gMTBDRslv1 detected gyrA mutations in 12 and rrs mutations in 8 MDR-TB isolates. gMTBDRsl2 additionally detected gyrB mutations in 2 and eis mutation in 1 isolate. Mutations in both gyrA/gyrB and rrs/eis were not detected. gMTBDRslv1 also detected ethambutol resistance-conferring embB mutations in 59 isolates. Although XDR-TB was not detected, frequency of resistance-conferring mutations for fluoroquinolones or SLIDs was significantly higher among isolates collected during 2013-2019 versus 2006-2012. Application of both tests is warranted for proper management of MDR-TB patients in Kuwait as gMTBDRslv2 detected resistance to fluoroquinolones and/or SLIDs in 3 additional isolates while gMTBDRslv1 additionally detected resistance to ethambutol in 58% of MDR-TB isolates.","10.1038/s41598-021-87516-0

A total of 339 strains were collected from smear-positive TB patients in the drug resistance survey of southwest China between January 2014 and December 2016. The MICs for the above mentioned drugs were determined for MDR-TB by conventional drug susceptibility testing. Genes related to drug resistance were amplified with their corresponding pairs of primers.
MDR was observed in 88 (26.0%; 88/339) isolates. LFX had the highest resistance rate (50.0%; 44/88), followed by MFX (38.6%; 34/88). The resistance rate to LZD, CFZ, and DLM was 4.5% (4/88), 3.4% (3/88), and 4.5% (4/88), respectively, and the lowest resistance rate was observed in BDQ (2.3%; 2/88). Of the 45 isolates resistant to LFX and MFX, the most prevalent resistance mutation was found in gyrA with the substitution of codon 94 (34/45, 75.6%). Two strains with CFZ - BDQ cross resistance had a mutation in the Rv0678 gene. Of the four LZD resistant isolates, two carried mutations in rplC gene. For the four isolates resistant to DLM, one isolate had mutations in codon 318 of fbiC gene, and two isolates were with mutations in codon 81 of ddn gene.
This study provided evidence of the usefulness of new anti-TB drugs in the treatment of MDR-TB in China.","10.1186/s12879-021-06024-8

33826064,In Silico Approach for Phytocompound-Based Drug Designing to Fight Efflux Pump-Mediated Multidrug-Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is one of the principal causes of death in the world despite the existence of a significant number of antibiotics aimed against it. This is mainly due to the drug resistance mechanisms present in the bacterium, which leads to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Additionally, the development of new antibiotics has become limited over the years. Although there are various drug resistance mechanisms present, efflux pumps are of utmost importance because they extrude out several dissimilar antitubercular drugs out of the cell. There are many efflux pump proteins present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, blocking these efflux pumps by inhibitors can raise the efficacy of the existing antibiotics and may also pave the path for the discovery and synthesis of new drugs. Plant compounds can act as a resource for the development of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), which may eventually replace or augment the current therapeutic options. This is mainly because plants have been traditionally used for ages for food or treatment and are considered safe with little or no side effects. Various computational tools are available which are used for the virtual screening of a large number of phytocompounds within a short span of time. This review aims to highlight the mechanism and appearance of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis with emphasis on efflux pumps along with the significance of phytochemicals as inhibitors of these pumps and their screening strategy by computational approaches.","10.1007/s12010-021-03557-1

A population-based surveillance was undertaking on all culture-positive TB cases in Jiangsu province, China from 2013 to 2019. Phenotypic drug susceptibility test (DST) by proportion method and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) were adopted for drug resistance and genotype detection.
A total of 1451 culture-positive TB patients were collected and 30 (2.06%, 30/1451) TB cases had recurrent TB episodes. Except 7 isolates were failed during subculture, 23 paired isolates were assessed. After genotyping by MIRU-VNTR, 12 (52.17%, 12/23) paired recurrence TB were demonstrated as relapse and 11 (47.83%,11/23) paired cases were identified as re-infection. The average interval time for recurrence was 24.04 (95%CI: 19.37-28.71) months, and there was no significant difference between relapse and re-infection. For the relapsed cases, two paired isolates exhibited drug resistance shifting, while four paired isolates revealed inconsistent drug resistance among the re-infection group including two multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) at the second episode.
Relapse and re-infection contributed equally to the current situation of recurrence TB in Jiangsu, China.

33836367,Successful treatment of refractory cystitis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus with Belimumab.,International immunopharmacology,"Lupus cystitis (LC) is a rare manifestation of SLE, the diagnosis of LC is challenging, especially in the absence of other systemic manifestations or the obvious disease activity index of SLE, further cystoscopy and bladder biopsy are crucial. The symptoms of cystitis could be controlled with high-dose GC, but in the process of GC reduction, the condition repeated. Here we report one case of refractory LC treated with Belimumab. The case is a 45-year-old female patient who had SLE and presented with urinary urgency, frequency and pain for more than 3 years. Laboratory assays revealed high ANA, reduced complement 3 level, proteinuria, significantly elevated Leukocyte esterase and leukocyte in urine, with the negative urinary culture of bacteria and mycoplasma, meanwhile, the cystoscopy and bladder biopsy showed interstitial inflammation. Confirming the diagnosis of refractory SLE-LC, recommended-dose Belimumab (10 mg/kg fortnightly for 3 times, monthly for 6 times) was administered, resulting in the normalization of urinary activity and significant reductions in leukocyte counts and protein levels of urine. No lupus cystitis relapse or SLE activity occurred during 10 months of follow-up.

The Tygerberg Endocarditis Cohort (TEC) study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of patients with confirmed or suspected IE presenting to Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Current analysis includes patients that presented between November 2019 and August 2020. Forty four (44) patients have been included in this ongoing study. Fourteen of the 44 patients (31.8%) had BCNE. Further analysis of the patients with BCNE identified Bartonella species as the most common causative organism (n=6; 43%). Other causes included Mycoplasma species (n=2). No cause could be identified in 4 of the 44 patients (9%). Bartonella quintana was identified with PCR of valvular tissue as the causative organism in 4 of the 5 patients that underwent urgent surgery. The patients with Bartonella IE (n=6) had an average age of 39 years with equal gender distribution. The common clinical features were clubbing (n=5; 83%), anemia (n=4; 66.6%), haematuria (n=3; 50%), acute on chronic severe regurgitant lesion (n=3; 50%) and acute severe regurgitant lesion (n=2; 33.3%).The aortic valve was involved in 5 of 6 patients. During a mean follow-up period of 251 days after diagnosis, no major adverse events occurred. Bartonella-associated IE is an important cause of BCNE in the Western Cape of South Africa. Imaging findings (in patients with BCNE) of significant valvular destruction with large vegetations on the aortic valve not affected by congenital or rheumatic valve disease should raise the suspicion of Bartonella-associated IE.","10.1007/s10096-021-04239-w

33707544,Determination of metabolic activity in planktonic and biofilm cells of Mycoplasma fermentans and Mycoplasma pneumoniae by nuclear magnetic resonance.,Scientific reports,"Mycoplasmas are fastidious microorganisms, typically characterised by their restricted metabolism and minimalist genome. Although there is reported evidence that some mycoplasmas can develop biofilms little is known about any differences in metabolism in these organisms between the growth states. A systematic metabolomics approach may help clarify differences associated between planktonic and biofilm associated mycoplasmas. In the current study, the metabolomics of two different mycoplasmas of clinical importance (Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma fermentans) were examined using a novel approach involving nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and principle component analysis. Characterisation of metabolic changes was facilitated through the generation of high-density metabolite data and diffusion-ordered spectroscopy that provided the size and structural information of the molecules under examination. This enabled the discrimination between biofilms and planktonic states for the metabolomic profiles of both organisms. This work identified clear biofilm/planktonic differences in metabolite composition for both clinical mycoplasmas and the outcomes serve to establish a baseline understanding of the changes in metabolism observed in these pathogens in their different growth states. This may offer insight into how these organisms are capable of exploiting and persisting in different niches and so facilitate their survival in the clinical setting.",10.1038/s41598-021-84326-2,"[{'lastname': 'Awadh', 'firstname': 'Ammar A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Pharmacy and Chemistry, SEC Faculty, Kingston University London, Kingston Upon Thames, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Le Gresley', 'firstname': 'Adam', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Pharmacy and Chemistry, SEC Faculty, Kingston University London, Kingston Upon Thames, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Forster-Wilkins', 'firstname': 'Gary', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Pharmacy and Chemistry, SEC Faculty, Kingston University London, Kingston Upon Thames, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Kelly', 'firstname': 'Alison F', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Pharmacy and Chemistry, SEC Faculty, Kingston University London, Kingston Upon Thames, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fielder', 'firstname': 'Mark D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'School of Life Sciences, Pharmacy and Chemistry, SEC Faculty, Kingston University London, Kingston Upon Thames, UK. m.fielder@kingston.ac.uk.'}]"
33472649,Molecular detection of urogenital mollicutes in patients with invasive malignant prostate tumor.,Infectious agents and cancer,"The etiology of prostate cancer (PCa) is multiple and complex. Among the causes recently cited are chronic infections engendered by microorganisms that often go unnoticed. A typical illustration of such a case is infection due to mollicutes bacteria. Generally known by their lurking nature, urogenital mollicutes are the most incriminated in PCa. This study was thus carried out in an attempt to establish the presence of these mollicutes by PCR in biopsies of confirmed PCa patients and to evaluate their prevalence.
A total of 105 Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded prostate tissues collected from 50 patients suffering from PCa and 55 with benign prostate hyperplasia were subjected to PCR amplification targeting species-specific genes of 5 urogenital mollicutes species, Mycoplasma genitalium, M. hominis, M. fermentans, Ureaplasma parvum, and U. urealyticum. PCR products were then sequenced to confirm species identification. Results significance was statistically assessed using Chi-square and Odds ratio tests.
PCR amplification showed no positive results for M. genitalium, M. hominis, and M. fermentans in all tested patients. Strikingly, Ureaplasma spp. were detected among 30% (15/50) of PCa patients. Nucleotide sequencing further confirmed the identified ureaplasma species, which were distributed as follows: 7 individuals with only U. parvum, 5 with only U. urealyticum, and 3 co-infection cases. Association of the two ureaplasma species with PCa cases proved statistically significant (P < 0.05), and found to represent a risk factor. Of note, Ureaplasma spp. were mostly identified in patients aged 60 and above with prostatic specific antigen (PSA) level > 4 ng/ml and an invasive malignant prostate tumor (Gleason score 8-10).
This study uncovered a significant association of Ureaplasma spp. with PCa arguing in favour of their potential involvement in this condition. Yet, this finding, though statistically supported, warrants a thorough investigation at a much larger scale.",10.1186/s13027-021-00344-9,"[{'lastname': 'Abdul-Wahab', 'firstname': 'Osama Mohammed Saed', 'initials': 'OMS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Shyarba', 'firstname': 'Mishari H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, College of Medicine, King Khalid University, P.O.

31914019,Association of Mycoplasma fermentans and the risk of HIV-1 infection: A meta-analysis.,Medicine,"Previous studies have reported the association between Mycoplasma fermentans (M. fermentans) and the risk of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection, but the results were inconsistent. The present study aims to systematically review reported studies on M. fermentans and its association with HIV-1 infection, as well as to summarize the findings using a meta-analysis.
Studies meeting the inclusion criteria in the PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data, and Chongqing VIP databases up to March 2019 were identified. Cochran Q and I statistics were used to assess heterogeneity. Additionally, pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and displayed by Forest plots. Also, the funnel plot, Begg test, and Egger test were used to evaluate potential publication bias. In addition, the source of heterogeneity was investigated by subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
A total of 11 studies comprising 1028 HIV-1-positive patients and 1298 controls were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. Our results indicated that M. fermentans could increase the risk of HIV-1 infection among humans (OR = 3.66, 95%CI 1.26-10.64). Subgroup analysis showed that the risk of HIV-1 infection associated with M. fermentans was, based on the geographical distribution, 1.19 (95%CI 0.33-4.33) in Europe, 2.83 (95%CI 0.94-8.52) in United States, 11.92 (95%CI 3.93-36.15) in Asia; based on the source of the sample, 2.97 (95%CI 0.89-9.95) in blood samples, 4.36 (95%CI 1.63-11.68) in urine samples; based on the detection method, 2.80 (95%CI 0.72-10.96) with the polymerase chain reaction method, 5.54 (95%CI 1.21-25.28) with other detection methods; based on the source of controls, 1.91 (95%CI 0.53-6.89) in sexually transmitted diseases individuals, and 8.25 (95%CI 2.16-31.60) in health individuals.
Our study revealed evidence of the association between M. fermentans and HIV-1 infection. Considering the heterogeneity, further studies are warranted to understand the relationship between M. fermentans and HIV-1 infection.",10.1097/MD.0000000000018499,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Practice and Geriatrics, Pingxiang, Jiangxi 337075.'}, {'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Yonghai', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Jiangxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330029.'}, {'lastname': 'Wen', 'firstname': 'Yinghao', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Medical Oncology, Pingxiang People's Hospital.""}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Siping', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""The ICU, Pingxiang People's Hospital.""}, {'lastname': 'Liao', 'firstname': 'Jie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Clinical Laboratory, Pingxiang People's Hospital, Pingxiang, Jiangxi 337075.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Cadre Wards of Neurology Medicine, Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, China.""}]"
31775352,A New Sensitive Method for the Detection of Mycoplasmas Using Fluorescence Microscopy.,Cells,"Contamination of cell cultures by mycoplasmas is a very common phenomenon. As they can substantially alter cell metabolism and potentially spread to all cell cultures in laboratory, their early detection is necessary. One of the fastest and cheapest methods of mycoplasma detection relies on the direct staining of mycoplasmas' DNA by DAPI or Hoechst dyes. Although this method is easy and fast to perform, it suffers from the low signal provided by these dyes compared to the nuclear DNA. Therefore, the reporter cell lines are used for cultivation of mycoplasmas before DAPI or the Hoechst staining step. In the study presented, we have developed and tested a new immunofluorescence assay for the detection of mycoplasmas. The method is based on the enzymatic labeling using DNA polymerase I and modified nucleotides utilizing nicks in the mycoplasmas' DNA. Modified nucleotides are incorporated into mycoplasmas' DNA and subsequently visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. The developed approach is independent of the mycoplasma strain, does not intensely stain nuclear DNA, does not stain other bacteria, and provides higher sensitivity than the approach based on the direct labeling using DAPI or Hoechst dyes.",10.3390/cells8121510,"[{'lastname': 'Ligasová', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University Olomouc, Hněvotínská 5, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Vydržalová', 'firstname': 'Markéta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Pardubice, Studentská 573, 532 10 Pardubice, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Buriánová', 'firstname': 'Renata', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University Olomouc, Hněvotínská 5, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Brůčková', 'firstname': 'Lenka', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Chemical Technology, University of Pardubice, Studentská 573, 532 10 Pardubice, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Večeřová', 'firstname': 'Renata', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University Olomouc, Hněvotínská 3, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Janošťáková', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University Olomouc, Hněvotínská 5, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Koberna', 'firstname': 'Karel', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University Olomouc, Hněvotínská 5, 779 00 Olomouc, Czech Republic.'}]"

Genital mycoplasmas, such as Mycoplasma hominis and M. genitalium, are most frequently associated with several adverse effects on men&amp;rsquo;s fertility. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of M. hominis and M. genitalium in the semen samples in thenortheast of Iran. During thiscross-sectional study from February to May, 2018, 100 semen samples were collected from 100 infertile men in Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi province, northeast of Iran. The presence of M. hominis and M. genitalium was detected by cultivation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Multiplex PCR assays. The colony of mycoplasma was confirmed by Diene&amp;rsquo;s stain; moreover, arginine hydrolysis, glucose, and urea utilization were evaluated. The following semen indices were analyzed according to World Health Organization guidelines for semen analysis: color, volume, appearance, liquefaction, viscosity, concentration, pH, leukocyte concentration, progressive motility, morphological normality, motile sperm concentration, functional sperm concentration, sperm motility index, and functional sperm. The gene of 16SrRNA (GPO1&amp;amp; MGSO primers) was used as the target gene of the Mycoplasma genus in PCR assay. Multiplex-PCR was performed with a specific primer for conserved regions in the 16SrRNA gene for M. hominis (RNAH1&amp;amp; RNAH2 primers) and the 140-kDa Adhesion Protein Gene for M. genitalium (MG1 &amp;amp; MG2 primers).According to the results,9 (9%) samples were PCR-positive for Mycoplasma spp , while there were 7 (7%) cases isolated by cultivation. M. hominis was detected in 8 (8%) samples by Multiplex PCR, while there was no evidence for M. genitalium. The mean age scores of all infertile and infected men were obtained at 31 and 30 years, respectively. The study could not show any statistical correlation between mycoplasma infection and abnormal semen parameters. The heterogeneity of mycoplasma prevalence in the reports can be ascribed to differences in geographic areas, the sensitivity of the identification method, condition of the group (fertile/infertile), sample size, and operator proficiency.

32750107,Urethral microbiota in men: Association of Haemophilus influenzae and Mycoplasma penetrans with nongonococcal urethritis.,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,"Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) is a common syndrome with no known etiology in up to 50% of cases. We estimated associations between urethral bacteria and NGU in men who have sex with men (MSM) and men who have sex with women (MSW).
Urine was collected from NGU cases (129 MSM; 121 MSW) and controls (70 MSM; 114 MSW) attending a Seattle STD clinic. Cases had ≥5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Gram stain plus symptoms or discharge; controls had <5 PMNs, no symptoms, no discharge. NGU was considered idiopathic when Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis, adenovirus, and herpes simplex virus were absent. The urethral microbiota was characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Compositional lasso analysis was conducted to identify associations between bacterial taxa and NGU, and to select bacteria for targeted quantitative PCR (qPCR).
Among NGU cases, 45.2% were idiopathic. Based on compositional lasso analysis, we selected Haemophilus influenzae (HI) and Mycoplasma penetrans (MP) for targeted qPCR. Compared to 182 men without NGU, the 249 men with NGU were more likely to have HI (14% vs. 2%) and MP (21% vs. 1%) (both p≤0.001). In stratified analyses, detection of HI was associated with NGU among MSM (12% vs. 3%, p=0.036) and MSW (17% vs. 1%, p<0.001), but MP was associated with NGU only among MSM (13% vs. 1%, p=0.004). Associations were stronger in men with idiopathic NGU.
HI and MP are potential causes of male urethritis.

31900105,Mycoplasma penetrans bacteremia in an immunocompromised patient detected by metagenomic sequencing: a case report.,BMC infectious diseases,"Mycoplasma sp. are well recognized as etiological agents of respiratory and sexually transmitted disease. Mycoplasma penetrans, a species of Mycoplasma sp., has been frequently detected in HIV-positive patients and associated with the progression of HIV-associated disease. To date, there is only a single case report describing M. penetrans as the causative agent of a severe respiratory tract infection in a HIV-negative patient.
In this report, we describe the case of M. penetrans bacteremia in a HIV-negative, 38-year-old, female, immunocompromised, solid organ transplant patient (combined kidney and pancreas transplantation in 2016), who was admitted to our hospital with anemic uterine bleeding and fever of 38.3 °C. Several hours before her admission at our university hospital, a latex bladder catheter was inserted into her uterus and she complained about fatigue, dizziness and ongoing vaginal bleeding. Laboratory examination showed severe anemia, but microbiological examination was inconspicuous (culture negative vaginal and cervical smears, negative urine culture). Bacterial blood cultures showed a growth signal after 4 h, but microscopic examination with Gram staining and subcultures on different agar media did not identify bacterial pathogens. To identify the bacterial cause of malignancy in the patient, metagenomic sequencing of the blood culture was performed that identified M. penetrans.
Metagenomic sequencing identified M. penetrans in an immunosuppressed patient with culture-negative bacteremia. Clinicians should be aware of the opportunistic potential of M. penetrans that may cause severe infections in certain vulnerable patient populations and the limitations of culture and Gram staining for confirming the presence of fastidious bacterial pathogens like Mycoplasma spp.",10.1186/s12879-019-4723-7,"[{'lastname': 'Preiswerk', 'firstname': 'Benjamin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\nPresent Address: Triemli Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Imkamp', 'firstname': 'Frank', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Vorburger', 'firstname': 'Denise', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynecology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hömke', 'firstname': 'Rico V', 'initials': 'RV', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Keller', 'firstname': 'Peter M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\nPresent Address: Institute for Infectious Diseases, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wagner', 'firstname': 'Karoline', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. karoline.wagner@usb.ch.\nLaboratory Medicine, University Hospital of Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031, Basel, Switzerland. karoline.wagner@usb.ch.'}]"

In the Australian Capital Territory, there is limited information on how seasonal patterns for positive infections and testing may vary, a gap that has implications for control strategies.
We examined seasonal patterns of immunoassay results of patients from Canberra Hospital, Australia, who were tested for Cp and/or Myco. Pathology data, collected from August 1997 to March 2007 from 7,275 patients, were analysed with time series additive decomposition and time series regression.
The proportion of positive Cp infections was highest in March and April (autumn) and lowest in June and August (winter). The proportion of positive Myco infections was highest in December and January (summer) and lowest in August (winter), even though testing for the pathogen peaked in winter with a low in summer. Models with a long-term trend and a variable for month were a better fit for the data than the null models for both infections.
We found differences in seasonal patterns of testing and in the proportion of positive infections.

These patients were divided into three groups based on disease severity: mild or moderate, severe, or critically ill. Microbiological pathogens in blood, urine, and respiratory tract specimens were detected by the combination of culture, serology, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). The median age of participants was 48 years (IQR 34-60 years). 52 patients (12.7%) had at least one additional pathogen, 8.1% were co-infected, and 5.1% had a secondary infection.

PG is synthesized by class A/B penicillin-binding proteins (a/bPBPs) and shape, elongation, division, and sporulation (SEDS) proteins like RodA (as part of the Rod system cell elongation machinery) and degraded by ""autolytic"" enzymes to accommodate growth processes. It is thought that autolysins (particularly endopeptidases [EPs]) are required for PG synthesis and incorporation by creating gaps that are patched and paved by PG synthases, but the exact relationship between autolysins and PG synthesis remains incompletely understood.

33815376,CD169+ Subcapsular Macrophage Role in Antigen Adjuvant Activity.,Frontiers in immunology,"Vaccines have played a pivotal role in improving public health, however, many infectious diseases lack an effective vaccine. Controlling the spread of infectious diseases requires continuing studies to develop new and improved vaccines. Our laboratory has been investigating the immune enhancing mechanisms of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-based adjuvants, including the TLR2 ligand Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein, PorB. Adjuvant use of PorB increases costimulatory factors on antigen presenting cells (APC), increases antigen specific antibody production, and cytokine producing T cells. We have demonstrated that macrophage expression of MyD88 (required for TLR2 signaling) is an absolute requirement for the improved antibody response induced by PorB. Here-in, we specifically investigated the role of subcapsular CD169+ marginal zone macrophages in antibody production induced by the use of TLR-ligand based adjuvants (PorB and CpG) and non-TLR-ligand adjuvants (aluminum salts). CD169 knockout mice and mice treated with low dose clodronate treated animals (which only remove marginal zone macrophages), were used to investigate the role of these macrophages in adjuvant-dependent antibody production. In both sets of mice, total antigen specific immunoglobulins (IgGs) were diminished regardless of adjuvant used. However, the greatest reduction was seen with the use of TLR ligands as adjuvants. In addition, the effect of the absence of CD169+ macrophages on adjuvant induced antigen and antigen presenting cell trafficking to the lymph nodes was examined using immunofluorescence by determining the relative extent of antigen loading on dendritic cells (DCs) and antigen deposition on follicular dendritic cells (FDC). Interestingly, only vaccine preparations containing PorB had significant decreases in antigen deposition in lymphoid follicles and germinal centers in CD169 knockout mice or mice treated with low dose clodronate as compared to wildtype controls. Mice immunized with CpG containing preparations demonstrated decreased FDC networks in the mice treated with low dose clodronate. Conversely, alum containing preparations only demonstrated significant decreases in IgG in CD169 knockout mice. These studies stress that importance of subcapsular macrophages and their unique role in adjuvant-mediated antibody production, potentially due to an effect of these adjuvants on antigen trafficking to the lymph node and deposition on follicular dendritic cells.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.624197,"[{'lastname': 'Lisk', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuen', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuniholm', 'firstname': 'Jeff', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Antos', 'firstname': 'Danielle', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Reiser', 'firstname': 'Michael L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'DRK-Blutspendedienst, BaWü-Hessen gGmbH, Frankfurt, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wetzler', 'firstname': 'Lee M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States.\nDepartment of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States.'}]"

Two species of on-host chiggers were identified, the one, Leptotrombidium deliense, much more dominant (94.8%) than the other, Ascoshoengastia sp. (5.2%). The pathogen was detected in two pools (12.5%) of L. deliense recovered from Rattus rattus and Tupaia sp. The 56-kDa TSA gene sequence analysis revealed the O. tsutsugamushi harboured in those chiggers were Karp prototype strain with high similarity (99.3%). Findings of this study strongly supported the existence of scrub typhus infections in certain parts of Malaysia which agrees with previous local reports. Moreover, this study highlighted the pressing need of a large-scale close observation of O. tsutsugamushi DNA sequences from chiggers that can probably be collected from other positive scrub typhus localities to precisely provide the distribution and prevalence of this zoonotic pathogen.","10.1007/s10493-021-00609-3

33784301,"Misdiagnosis of scrub typhus as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and potential co-infection of both diseases in patients in Shandong Province, China, 2013-2014.",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, an obligate intracellular gram-negative bacterium, along with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by hantaviruses, are natural-focus infectious diseases prevalent in Shandong Province, China. Both diseases have similar clinical manifestations in certain disease stages and similar epidemic seasons, which has caused difficulties for physicians in distinguishing them. The aim of this study was to investigate whether misdiagnosis of scrub typhus as HFRS occurred in patients in Shandong Province.
Serum samples (N = 112) of clinically suspected HFRS patients from 2013 to 2014 in Shandong Province were analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for antibodies to both hantavirus and Orientia tsutsugamushi.
ELISA showed that 56.3% (63/112) and 8.0% (9/112) of clinically suspected HFRS patients were IgM antibody positive to hantavirus and O. tsutsugamushi, respectively. Among the hantavirus IgM antibody positive patients, 7.9% (5/63) were also IgM antibody positive to O. tsutsugamushi. Among the hantavirus IgM antibody negative sera, 8.2% (4/49) of sera were positive to O. tsutsugamushi.
We concluded that some scrub typhus patients were misdiagnosed as HFRS and co-infection of scrub typhus and HFRS might exist in China. Due to the different treatments for scrub typhus and HFRS, physicians should carefully differentiate between scrub typhus and HFRS and consider administering anti-rickettsia antibiotics if treatment for HFRS alone does not work.",10.1371/journal.pntd.0009270,"[{'lastname': 'Gu', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Lan', 'initials': 'XL', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qi', 'firstname': 'Rui', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Wen-Qian', 'initials': 'WQ', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiao', 'firstname': 'Yong-Jun', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pathogenic Microbiology, Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Key Laboratory of Enteric Pathogenic Microbiology, Ministry Health, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Xue-Jie', 'initials': 'XJ', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Virology, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.'}]"

This study used bioinformatic approaches to explore the genomic diversity of 656 P. multocida isolates and epidemiological associations between host factors and specific genotypes. Isolates included in this study originated from a variety of hosts, including poultry, cattle, swine, rabbits, rodents, and humans, from five different continents. Multi-locus sequence typing identified 69 different sequence types. In-silico methodology for determining capsular serogroup was developed, validated, and applied to all genome sequences, whereby capsular serogroups A, B, D, and F were found. Whole genome phylogeny was constructed from 237,670 core single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and demonstrated an overall lack of host or capsular serogroup specificity, with the exception of isolates from bovine sources. Specific SNVs within the srlB gene were identified in P. multocida subsp. septica genomes, representing specific mutations that may be useful for differentiating one of the three known subspecies. Significant associations were identified between capsular serogroup and virulence factors, including capsular serogroup A and OmpH1, OmpH3, PlpE, and PfhB1; capsular serogroup B and HgbA and PtfA; and capsular serogroup F and PtfA and PlpP. Various mobile genetic elements were identified including those similar to ICEPmu1, ICEhin1056, and IncQ1 plasmids, all of which harbored multiple antimicrobial resistance-encoding genes. Additional analyses were performed on a subset of 99 isolates obtained from turkeys during fowl cholera outbreaks from a single company which revealed that multiple strains of P. multocida were circulating during the outbreak, instead of a single, highly virulent clone. This study further demonstrates the extensive genomic diversity of P. multocida, provides epidemiological context to the various genotyping schemes that have traditionally been used for differentiating isolates, and introduces additional tools for P. multocida molecular typing.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249138,"[{'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Aguayo', 'firstname': 'Jeannette Munoz', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Mid-Central Research and Outreach Center, University of Minnesota, Willmar, Minnesota, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Figueroa', 'firstname': 'Cristian Flores', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': 'Mid-Central Research and Outreach Center, University of Minnesota, Willmar, Minnesota, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Nezworski', 'firstname': 'Jill', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Blue House Veterinary LLC, Buffalo Lake, Minnesota, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Studniski', 'firstname': 'Marissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Select Genetics, Willmar, MN, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Wileman', 'firstname': 'Ben', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Select Genetics, Willmar, MN, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Timothy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, United States of America.\nMid-Central Research and Outreach Center, University of Minnesota, Willmar, Minnesota, United States of America.'}]"
33794048,Melting corneal ulcers (keratomalacia) in dogs: A 5-year clinical and microbiological study (2014-2018).,Veterinary ophthalmology,"To identify bacterial microorganisms associated with canine keratomalacia, review their antimicrobial sensitivity, and evaluate clinical outcomes compared to results of microbial culture.
Retrospective analysis of clinical records of dogs diagnosed with a melting corneal ulcer presented to a referral hospital in Hertfordshire, UK between 2014 and 2018.
One hundred and ten melting corneal ulcers were sampled in 106 dogs. The most common pure bacterial isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 26) followed by β-hemolytic Streptococcus (n = 12). Melting corneal ulcers that cultured coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, coliform bacteria, Pasteurella multocida, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus viridans presented in smaller numbers and were analyzed together (n = 16). Multiple cultures were identified in nine cases (n = 9). Forty-seven cultures yielded no bacterial growth (n = 47). The susceptibility to fluoroquinolones remained high with the exception of β-hemolytic Streptococci. There was no significant difference in the ulcer severity at presentation in regard to the cultured bacteria. Overall, 63 eyes (57%) received surgical grafting in addition to medical treatment. In 14 cases (13%), the progression of corneal melting despite medical ± surgical treatment resulted in enucleation. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of the enucleated eyes cultured pure Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. In contrast, all β-hemolytic Streptococcus-associated ulcers healed.
The most common bacterial species associated with canine keratomalacia were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and β-hemolytic Streptococcus. Because of the variation in antibacterial sensitivity between these two species, bacterial culture and sensitivity testing should be performed in all dogs presenting with keratomalacia. Melting corneal ulcers associated with pure Pseudomonas infection were significantly more likely to result in globe loss than melting corneal ulcers associated with other cultures.",10.1111/vop.12885,"[{'lastname': 'Tsvetanova', 'firstname': 'Agata', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Davies Veterinary Specialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Hertfordshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Powell', 'firstname': 'Roger M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Veterinary Pathology Group, Hitchin, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsvetanov', 'firstname': 'Kamen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Kerry M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Davies Veterinary Specialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Hertfordshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gould', 'firstname': 'David J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Davies Veterinary Specialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Hertfordshire, UK.'}]"
33784980,Diversity and characterization of temperate bacteriophages induced in Pasteurella multocida from different host species.,BMC microbiology,"Bacteriophages play important roles in the evolution of bacteria and in the emergence of new pathogenic strains by mediating the horizontal transfer of virulence genes. Pasteurella multocida is responsible for different disease syndromes in a wide range of domesticated animal species. However, very little is known about the influence of bacteriophages on disease pathogenesis in this species.
Temperate bacteriophage diversity was assessed in 47 P. multocida isolates of avian (9), bovine (8), ovine (10) and porcine (20) origin. Induction of phage particles with mitomycin C identified a diverse range of morphological types representing both Siphoviridae and Myoviridae family-types in 29 isolates. Phage of both morphological types were identified in three isolates indicating that a single bacterial host may harbour multiple prophages. DNA was isolated from bacteriophages recovered from 18 P. multocida isolates and its characterization by restriction endonuclease (RE) analysis identified 10 different RE types. Phage of identical RE types were identified in certain closely-related strains but phage having different RE types were present in other closely-related isolates suggesting possible recent acquisition. The host range of the induced phage particles was explored using plaque assay but only 11 (38%) phage lysates produced signs of infection in a panel of indicator strains comprising all 47 isolates. Notably, the majority (9/11) of phage lysates which caused infection originated from two groups of phylogenetically unrelated ovine and porcine strains that uniquely possessed the toxA gene.
Pasteurella multocida possesses a wide range of Siphoviridae- and Myoviridae-type bacteriophages which likely play key roles in the evolution and virulence of this pathogen.",10.1186/s12866-021-02155-9,"[{'lastname': 'Abdulrahman', 'firstname': 'Rezheen F', 'initials': 'RF', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Sir Graeme Davies Building, University of Glasgow, 120 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.\nPathology and Microbiology Department, Collage of Veterinary Medicine, University of Duhok, Kurdistan Region, Iraq.'}, {'lastname': 'Davies', 'firstname': 'Robert L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Sir Graeme Davies Building, University of Glasgow, 120 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.

33764631,"Influenza D virus in respiratory disease in Canadian, province of Québec, cattle: relative importance and evidence of new reassortment between different clades.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,"Influenza D virus (IDV), a segmented single stranded negative sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus belongs to the new Delta influenza virus genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Cattle was proposed as the natural reservoir of IDV in which infection was associated with mild to moderate respiratory clinical signs (i.e. cough, nasal discharge, and dyspnoea).
In order to investigate the role of IDV in bovine respiratory disease, during the period 2017-2020, 883 nasal or naso-pharyngeal swabs from Canadian cattle with respiratory signs (cough and/or dyspnoea) were tested by (RT-)qPCR for IDV and other major bovine viral (bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, and bovine coronavirus) and bacterial (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis) respiratory pathogens. In addition, whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were carried out on five IDV positive samples. The prevalence of IDV RT-qPCR (with cut-off: Cq < 38) at animal level was estimated at 5.32% (95% confidence interval: 3.94-7.02). Positive result of IDV was significantly associated with (RT-)qPCR positive results for bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Mycoplasma bovis. While phylogenetic analyses indicate that most segments belonged to clade D/660, reassortment between clades D/660 and D/OK were evidenced in four samples collected in 2018-2020.
Relative importance of influenza D virus and associated pathogens in bovine respiratory disease of Canadian dairy cattle was established.

In-silico methodology for determining capsular serogroup was developed, validated, and applied to all genome sequences, whereby capsular serogroups A, B, D, and F were found. Whole genome phylogeny was constructed from 237,670 core single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and demonstrated an overall lack of host or capsular serogroup specificity, with the exception of isolates from bovine sources. Specific SNVs within the srlB gene were identified in P. multocida subsp. septica genomes, representing specific mutations that may be useful for differentiating one of the three known subspecies. Significant associations were identified between capsular serogroup and virulence factors, including capsular serogroup A and OmpH1, OmpH3, PlpE, and PfhB1; capsular serogroup B and HgbA and PtfA; and capsular serogroup F and PtfA and PlpP. Various mobile genetic elements were identified including those similar to ICEPmu1, ICEhin1056, and IncQ1 plasmids, all of which harbored multiple antimicrobial resistance-encoding genes. Additional analyses were performed on a subset of 99 isolates obtained from turkeys during fowl cholera outbreaks from a single company which revealed that multiple strains of P. multocida were circulating during the outbreak, instead of a single, highly virulent clone. This study further demonstrates the extensive genomic diversity of P. multocida, provides epidemiological context to the various genotyping schemes that have traditionally been used for differentiating isolates, and introduces additional tools for P. multocida molecular typing.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249138,"[{'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Aguayo', 'firstname': 'Jeannette Munoz', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Mid-Central Research and Outreach Center, University of Minnesota, Willmar, Minnesota, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Figueroa', 'firstname': 'Cristian Flores', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': 'Mid-Central Research and Outreach Center, University of Minnesota, Willmar, Minnesota, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Nezworski', 'firstname': 'Jill', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Blue House Veterinary LLC, Buffalo Lake, Minnesota, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Studniski', 'firstname': 'Marissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Select Genetics, Willmar, MN, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Wileman', 'firstname': 'Ben', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Select Genetics, Willmar, MN, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Timothy', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, MN, United States of America.\nMid-Central Research and Outreach Center, University of Minnesota, Willmar, Minnesota, United States of America.'}]"
33794048,Melting corneal ulcers (keratomalacia) in dogs: A 5-year clinical and microbiological study (2014-2018).,Veterinary ophthalmology,"To identify bacterial microorganisms associated with canine keratomalacia, review their antimicrobial sensitivity, and evaluate clinical outcomes compared to results of microbial culture.
Retrospective analysis of clinical records of dogs diagnosed with a melting corneal ulcer presented to a referral hospital in Hertfordshire, UK between 2014 and 2018.
One hundred and ten melting corneal ulcers were sampled in 106 dogs. The most common pure bacterial isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 26) followed by β-hemolytic Streptococcus (n = 12). Melting corneal ulcers that cultured coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, coliform bacteria, Pasteurella multocida, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus viridans presented in smaller numbers and were analyzed together (n = 16). Multiple cultures were identified in nine cases (n = 9). Forty-seven cultures yielded no bacterial growth (n = 47). The susceptibility to fluoroquinolones remained high with the exception of β-hemolytic Streptococci. There was no significant difference in the ulcer severity at presentation in regard to the cultured bacteria. Overall, 63 eyes (57%) received surgical grafting in addition to medical treatment. In 14 cases (13%), the progression of corneal melting despite medical ± surgical treatment resulted in enucleation. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of the enucleated eyes cultured pure Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. In contrast, all β-hemolytic Streptococcus-associated ulcers healed.
The most common bacterial species associated with canine keratomalacia were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and β-hemolytic Streptococcus. Because of the variation in antibacterial sensitivity between these two species, bacterial culture and sensitivity testing should be performed in all dogs presenting with keratomalacia. Melting corneal ulcers associated with pure Pseudomonas infection were significantly more likely to result in globe loss than melting corneal ulcers associated with other cultures.",10.1111/vop.12885,"[{'lastname': 'Tsvetanova', 'firstname': 'Agata', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Davies Veterinary Specialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Hertfordshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Powell', 'firstname': 'Roger M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Veterinary Pathology Group, Hitchin, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsvetanov', 'firstname': 'Kamen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Kerry M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Davies Veterinary Specialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Hertfordshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gould', 'firstname': 'David J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Davies Veterinary Specialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Hertfordshire, UK.'}]"
33784980,Diversity and characterization of temperate bacteriophages induced in Pasteurella multocida from different host species.,BMC microbiology,"Bacteriophages play important roles in the evolution of bacteria and in the emergence of new pathogenic strains by mediating the horizontal transfer of virulence genes. Pasteurella multocida is responsible for different disease syndromes in a wide range of domesticated animal species. However, very little is known about the influence of bacteriophages on disease pathogenesis in this species.
Temperate bacteriophage diversity was assessed in 47 P. multocida isolates of avian (9), bovine (8), ovine (10) and porcine (20) origin. Induction of phage particles with mitomycin C identified a diverse range of morphological types representing both Siphoviridae and Myoviridae family-types in 29 isolates. Phage of both morphological types were identified in three isolates indicating that a single bacterial host may harbour multiple prophages. DNA was isolated from bacteriophages recovered from 18 P. multocida isolates and its characterization by restriction endonuclease (RE) analysis identified 10 different RE types. Phage of identical RE types were identified in certain closely-related strains but phage having different RE types were present in other closely-related isolates suggesting possible recent acquisition. The host range of the induced phage particles was explored using plaque assay but only 11 (38%) phage lysates produced signs of infection in a panel of indicator strains comprising all 47 isolates. Notably, the majority (9/11) of phage lysates which caused infection originated from two groups of phylogenetically unrelated ovine and porcine strains that uniquely possessed the toxA gene.
Pasteurella multocida possesses a wide range of Siphoviridae- and Myoviridae-type bacteriophages which likely play key roles in the evolution and virulence of this pathogen.",10.1186/s12866-021-02155-9,"[{'lastname': 'Abdulrahman', 'firstname': 'Rezheen F', 'initials': 'RF', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Sir Graeme Davies Building, University of Glasgow, 120 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.\nPathology and Microbiology Department, Collage of Veterinary Medicine, University of Duhok, Kurdistan Region, Iraq.'}, {'lastname': 'Davies', 'firstname': 'Robert L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Sir Graeme Davies Building, University of Glasgow, 120 University Place, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.

33764631,"Influenza D virus in respiratory disease in Canadian, province of Québec, cattle: relative importance and evidence of new reassortment between different clades.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,"Influenza D virus (IDV), a segmented single stranded negative sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus belongs to the new Delta influenza virus genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. Cattle was proposed as the natural reservoir of IDV in which infection was associated with mild to moderate respiratory clinical signs (i.e. cough, nasal discharge, and dyspnoea).
In order to investigate the role of IDV in bovine respiratory disease, during the period 2017-2020, 883 nasal or naso-pharyngeal swabs from Canadian cattle with respiratory signs (cough and/or dyspnoea) were tested by (RT-)qPCR for IDV and other major bovine viral (bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, and bovine coronavirus) and bacterial (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma bovis) respiratory pathogens. In addition, whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were carried out on five IDV positive samples. The prevalence of IDV RT-qPCR (with cut-off: Cq < 38) at animal level was estimated at 5.32% (95% confidence interval: 3.94-7.02). Positive result of IDV was significantly associated with (RT-)qPCR positive results for bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Mycoplasma bovis. While phylogenetic analyses indicate that most segments belonged to clade D/660, reassortment between clades D/660 and D/OK were evidenced in four samples collected in 2018-2020.
Relative importance of influenza D virus and associated pathogens in bovine respiratory disease of Canadian dairy cattle was established. Whole genome sequencing demonstrated evidence of reassortment between clades D/660 and D/OK.

33828158,Discovery of uncompetitive inhibitors of SapM that compromise intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,Scientific reports,"SapM is a secreted virulence factor from Mycobacterium tuberculosis critical for pathogen survival and persistence inside the host. Its full potential as a target for tuberculosis treatment has not yet been exploited because of the lack of potent inhibitors available. By screening over 1500 small molecules, we have identified new potent and selective inhibitors of SapM with an uncompetitive mechanism of inhibition. The best inhibitors share a trihydroxy-benzene moiety essential for activity. Importantly, the inhibitors significantly reduce mycobacterial burden in infected human macrophages at 1 µM, and they are selective with respect to other mycobacterial and human phosphatases. The best inhibitor also reduces intracellular burden of Francisella tularensis, which secretes the virulence factor AcpA, a homologue of SapM, with the same mechanism of catalysis and inhibition. Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of SapM with small molecule inhibitors is efficient in reducing intracellular mycobacterial survival in host macrophages and confirm SapM as a potential therapeutic target. These initial compounds have favourable physico-chemical properties and provide a basis for exploration towards the development of new tuberculosis treatments. The efficacy of a SapM inhibitor in reducing Francisella tularensis intracellular burden suggests the potential for developing broad-spectrum antivirulence agents to treat microbial infections.","10.1038/s41598-021-87117-x

Despite an encouraging start, numbers of ferrets at the site have declined. In an effort to determine possible causes of the population decline, we undertook a pathogen survey in 2012 to detect exposure to West Nile virus (WNV), canine distemper virus (CDV), plague (Yersinia pestis), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) using coyotes (Canis latrans) as a sentinel animal. The highest seroprevalence was for WNV with 71% (20/28) of coyotes testing antibody-positive. Seroprevalence of CDV and plague were lower, 27% and 13%, respectively. No evidence of active infection with tularemia or heartworm was seen in the coyotes sampled. As this study did not sample black-footed ferrets themselves, the definitive cause for the decline of this population cannot be determined. However, the presence of coyotes seropositive for two diseases, plague and CDV, lethal to black-footed ferrets, indicated the potential for exposure and infection. The high seroprevalence of WNV in the coyotes indicated a wide exposure to the virus; therefore, exposure of black-footed ferrets to the virus is also likely. Due to the ability of WNV to cause fatal disease in other species, studies may be useful to elucidate the impact that WNV could have on the success of reintroduced black-footed ferrets as well as factors influencing the spread and incidence of the disease in a prairie ecosystem.",10.7589/JWD-D-20-00015,"[{'lastname': 'Schuler', 'firstname': 'Krysten', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Claymore', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Prairie Management Program, PO Box 590, Eagle Butte, South Dakota 57625, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schnitzler', 'firstname': 'Hannah', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dubovi', 'firstname': 'Edward', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Cornell University, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rocke', 'firstname': 'Tonie', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, 6006 Schroeder Rd., Madison, Wisconsin 53711, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Perry', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center Biodefense Laboratory, 120 New Scotland Ave., Albany, New York 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bowman', 'firstname': 'Dwight', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, C4 119 Veterinary Medical Center, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abbott', 'firstname': 'Rachel C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, 6006 Schroeder Rd., Madison, Wisconsin 53711, USA.'}]"

33789598,Francisella tularensis human infections in a village of northwest Iran.,BMC infectious diseases,"Recent seroepidemiological studies have suggested that tularemia could be an endemic bacterial zoonosis in Iran.
From January 2016 to June 2018, disease cases characterized by fever, cervical lymphadenopathy and ocular involvement were reported in Youzband Village of Kaleybar County, in the East Azerbaijan Province, northwestern Iran. Diagnostic tests included Francisella tularensis serology (including tube agglutination test and ELISA), PCR, and culture.
Among 11 examined case-patients, the tularemia tube agglutination test was positive in ten and borderline in one. PCR detected the F. tularensis ISFtu2 elements and fopA gene in one rodent and a spring water sample from the same geographic area.
Based on the clinical manifestations of the disease suggesting an oropharyngeal form of tularemia, serology results in case patients, and F. tularensis detection in the local fauna and aquatic environment, the water supply of the village was the likely source of the tularemia outbreak.

33789570,Bacterial community structure alterations within the colorectal cancer gut microbiome.,BMC microbiology,"Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The human gut microbiome has become an active area of research for understanding the initiation, progression, and treatment of colorectal cancer. Despite multiple studies having found significant alterations in the carriage of specific bacteria within the gut microbiome of colorectal cancer patients, no single bacterium has been unequivocally connected to all cases. Whether alterations in species carriages are the cause or outcome of cancer formation is still unclear, but what is clear is that focus should be placed on understanding changes to the bacterial community structure within the cancer-associated gut microbiome.
By applying a novel set of analyses on 252 previously published whole-genome shotgun sequenced fecal samples from healthy and late-stage colorectal cancer subjects, we identify taxonomic, functional, and structural changes within the cancer-associated human gut microbiome. Bacterial association networks constructed from these data exhibited widespread differences in the underlying bacterial community structure between healthy and colorectal cancer associated gut microbiomes. Within the cancer-associated ecosystem, bacterial species were found to form associations with other species that are taxonomically and functionally dissimilar to themselves, as well as form modules functionally geared towards potential changes in the tumor-associated ecosystem. Bacterial community profiling of these samples revealed a significant increase in species diversity within the cancer-associated gut microbiome, and an elevated relative abundance of species classified as originating from the oral microbiome including, but not limited to, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Gemella morbillorum, and Parvimonas micra. Differential abundance analyses of community functional capabilities revealed an elevation in functions linked to virulence factors and peptide degradation, and a reduction in functions involved in amino-acid biosynthesis within the colorectal cancer gut microbiome.
We utilize whole-genome shotgun sequenced fecal samples provided from a large cohort of late-stage colorectal cancer and healthy subjects to identify a number of potentially important taxonomic, functional, and structural alterations occurring within the colorectal cancer associated gut microbiome. Our analyses indicate that the cancer-associated ecosystem influences bacterial partner selection in the native microbiota, and we highlight specific oral bacteria and their associations as potentially relevant towards aiding tumor progression.",10.1186/s12866-021-02153-x,"[{'lastname': 'Loftus', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, Genomics and Bioinformatics Cluster, University of Central Florida, Orlando, 32816, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hassouneh', 'firstname': 'Sayf Al-Deen', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, Genomics and Bioinformatics Cluster, University of Central Florida, Orlando, 32816, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yooseph', 'firstname': 'Shibu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Genomics and Bioinformatics Cluster, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, 32816, USA.

33765142,Bacteriophage manipulation of the microbiome associated with tumour microenvironments-can this improve cancer therapeutic response?,FEMS microbiology reviews,"Some cancer treatment failures have been attributed to the tumour microbiota, with implications that microbiota manipulation may improve treatment efficacy. While antibiotics have been used to control bacterial growth, their dysbiotic effects on the microbiome, failure to penetrate biofilms and decreased efficacy due to increasing antimicrobial resistance by bacteria, suggest alternatives are needed. Bacteriophages may provide a precise means for targeting oncobacteria whose relative abundance is increased in tumour tissue microbiomes. Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Parvimonas, and Treponema species are prevalent in tumour tissue microbiomes of some cancers. They may promote cancer growth by dampening immunity, stimulating release of proinflammatory cytokines, and directly interacting with cancer cells to stimulate proliferation. Lytic bacteriophages against some of these oncobacteria have been isolated and characterised. The search continues for others. The possibility exists for their testing as adjuncts to complement existing therapies. In this review, we highlight the role of oncobacteria, specifically those whose relative abundance in the intra-tumour microbiome is increased, and discuss the potential for bacteriophages against these micro-organisms to augment existing cancer therapies. The capacity for bacteriophages to modulate immunity and kill specific bacteria makes them suitable candidates to manipulate the tumour microbiome and negate the effects of these oncobacteria.",10.1093/femsre/fuab017,"[{'lastname': 'Kabwe', 'firstname': 'Mwila', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dashper', 'firstname': 'Stuart', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Melbourne Dental School, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bachrach', 'firstname': 'Gilad', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'The Institute of Dental Sciences, The Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Dental Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Tucci', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia.'}]"

33830141,A Preliminary Study on the Evaluation of In-vitro Inhibition Potential of Antimicrobial Efficacy of Raw and Commercial Honey on Escherichia coli: An Emerging Periodontal Pathogen.,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,"Periodontitis, a multiple pathogen disease has the latest addition to the family i.e. Escherichia coli as a potential and emerging periodontal pathogen owing to its lipopolysaccharide more potent than Porphyromonas gingivalis, which makes it an emerging threat in periodontal disease. The role of antimicrobial agents in the management of periodontal diseases is of utmost importance. However, in the present scenario, antibiotic resistance is a public health concern now and there are very few options left for treatment. So, honey, a pioneer in traditional medicine was tried in the treatment against Escherichia coli to evaluate and compare the ""in-vitro"" antibacterial activity and efficacy of raw and commercial honey at different concentrations in comparison to tetracycline as a control on patient-isolated Escherichia coli and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Escherichia coli 25922 strain from 5th Aug 2018 to 15th Feb 2019 at the Department of Microbiology, Rama Medical College, Kanpur (UP), India. In the in-vitro study different concentrations (100%, 75%, 50% and 25% v/v) of raw and commercial honey were studied and sensitivity tests were used to evaluate their antibacterial effect on patient-isolated Escherichia coli and the ATCC Escherichia coli 25922 strain. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were also determined for raw honey, and commercial honey in comparison to tetracycline. In case of raw honey, zone of inhibition was seen at 100%, 75% and 50% concentration, with maximum inhibition being 27±1.154mm and 23±0.666mm for patient-isolated Escherichia coli and ATCC Escherichia coli 25922 strain respectively at 100% concentration, whereas, the commercial honey was effective only at 100% and 75% concentration, with maximum inhibition zone of 13±1.054mm and 17±0.942mm at 100% concentration on patient-isolated Escherichia coli and ATCC Escherichia coli 25922 strain respectively. However, no effect was observed at 25% concentration for both raw and commercial honey. The MIC and MBC of raw and commercial honey were determined by the broth dilution method, where raw honey exhibited both MIC and MBC at 512 mg/ml whereas, and commercial honey exhibited MIC at 512mg/ml and MBC at 1024 mg/ml respectively. While comparing the zone of inhibition of raw and commercial honey, it was observed that the raw honey showed almost equivalent potency and efficacy as compared to a positive control tetracycline (2.5%). There was statistically significant difference (p≤0.01) in zone of inhibition of raw and commercial honey at 100% concentration on patient-isolated Escherichia coli and ATCC Escherichia coli 25922 strain.

33826149,Variations in IgG antibody subclass responses to oral bacteria: Effects of periodontal disease and modifying factors.,Journal of periodontal research,"Local and systemic IgG antibodies or oral bacteria have been described with periodontitis. We extended these observations by assessing the impact of a range of intrinsic factors on serum IgG subclass antibodies to both commensal and pathogenic oral bacteria that would contribute to variations in immune protection or disease susceptibility in periodontitis have not been described.
Subjects (n = 278) were classified as healthy, gingivitis, or periodontitis and categorized as mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis. Demographic stratification included sex, age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and obesity. Whole formalin-fixed bacteria were used as antigens to detect serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass antibody levels using an ELISA.
The greatest differences in variations in IgG subclasses occurred in periodontitis versus health or gingivitis to bacteria considered oral pathogens (eg, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola) with IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 increased by three- to sevenfold with Pg. Differences in subclass levels and distribution were also observed related to disease severity, particularly related to individual subclass responses to Pg. Examination of the overall population showed that females had elevated antibody, reflected by elevated IgG2 amounts/proportions. The older group of subjects demonstrated elevated antibody to multiple oral bacteria, lacking any particular subclass pattern. IgG2 antibody to Aa and Pg was increased in smokers. Multiple IgG subclass antibody levels to oral pathogens were significantly decreased in the obese subset within this population.
This investigation identified patterns of IgG subclass antibody responses to oral bacteria and demonstrated substantial effects of disease impacting the level and subclass distribution of antibody to an array of oral bacteria.

33830114,Quick Identification and Differentiation of Proteus spp. by PCR and RFLP Along with Their Antibiotic Resistance Pattern.,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,"Different Proteus species are encountered in human infections and may vary with the type of infections they cause. So, the present study was conducted to detect species of Proteus by PCR and RFLP along with their antibiotic resistance pattern. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Microbiology of Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh, from July 2018 to June 2019. A total of 500 wound swab and pus, urine and blood samples were tested for bacterial pathogens. Proteus spp. were identified and differentiated by biochemical test, PCR and RFLP. Antibiotic susceptibility was performed by disc-diffusion technique. Fourty Proteus spp. was isolated from 300 culture positive samples, giving 13.33% prevalence of Proteus infections. Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were identified by culture, biochemical test, PCR and RFLP. The results were similar by both methods (biochemical tests and PCR). RFLP of 16S rRNA fragments digested with HaeIII revealed that P. mirabilis consisted of two bands at approximately 110 and 190 bp and P. vulgaris consisted of three bands at approximately 100, 180 and 220 bp. The proportion (80%) of P. mirabilis was more than P. vulgaris. Highest proportion (77.5%) of Proteus spp. was isolated from wound swab and pus followed by urine samples. A significant proportion of Proteus spp. was multidrug resistant (90%) and extensively drug resistant (37.5%). Fosfomycin was found the most sensitive drug followed by imipenem. This study provided an insight into antibiotic resistance pattern of Proteus spp. and showed high level resistance towards commonly used antimicrobial agents. PCR and RFLP may be suitable method to identify and differentiate species of Proteus and to treat them accordingly.",,"[{'lastname': 'Jannat', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Dr Hasnatul Jannat, Assistant Surgeon, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh; E-mail: hasnatuljannatszmc17@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Shamsuzzaman', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Faisal', 'firstname': 'M A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Khanam', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]"

33827527,Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: a focus on microbiological and antibiotic resistance profiles.,BMC urology,"Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is an inflammatory condition of the kidney and its treatment most often involves a combination of antibiotics and nephrectomy. This study aimed to define the clinical features and management of XGP, focusing on microbiological aspects and antibiotic therapy.
We performed a retrospective study of 27 cases of XGP diagnosed between January 2001 and January 2020 to analyse their clinical and management characteristics. In addition, a literature review was conducted of XGP case series covering the period from 2000-2020. We searched PubMed for case series through April 2020 without language restrictions. Studies reporting case series of XGP (more than ten cases) were included if they were relevant to this study.
Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed with XGP, and 26 of them were histologically proven to have XGP. A total of 81.5% of the patients were female and the mean age was 59.6 years (SD 19.2). The most frequent symptoms were flank pain (70.4%) and fever (59.3%), while 77.8% of patients had renal stones. Proteus mirabilis was detected in the urine culture in 18.5% of patients, followed by detection of Escherichia coli in 14.8% of patients. The computed tomography (CT) findings included perirenal (29.6%) or pararenal (29.6%) involvement in the majority of patients. Twenty-six patients underwent nephrectomy. Piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for treatment. The reported piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone resistance rates were 14.3% and 16.6%, respectively. Twenty-six case series were included in the literature review, reporting 693 cases in total.
We found well-established characteristics of XGP patients among series in terms of previous history, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings, and operative and postoperative outcomes. It is important to know the clinical presentation and potential severity of XGP, as well as the most frequently involved microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles, to select the most appropriate antibiotic therapy.","10.1186/s12894-021-00800-z

33797716,Sunlight-induced photocatalytic degradation of various dyes and bacterial inactivation using CuO-MgO-ZnO nanocomposite.,Environmental science and pollution research international,"Novel tri-phase CuO-MgO-ZnO nanocomposite was prepared using the co-precipitation technique and investigated its physical properties using characterization techniques including XRD, FTIR, Raman, IV, UV-vis, PL, and SEM. The application of grown CuO-MgO-ZnO nanocomposite for the degradation of various dyes under sunlight and antibacterial activity against different bacteria were studied. The XRD confirmed the existence of diffraction peaks related to CuO (monoclinic), MgO (cubic), and ZnO (hexagonal) with CuO phase 40%, MgO 24%, and ZnO 36%. The optical energy gap of nanocomposite was 2.9 eV, which made it an efficient catalyst under sunlight. Raman and FTIR spectra have further confirmed the formation of the nanocomposite. SEM images revealed agglomerated rod-shaped morphology. EDX results showed the atomic percentage of a constituent element in this order Cu>Zn>Mg. PL results demonstrate the presence of intrinsic defects. The photocatalytic activity against methylene blue (MB), methyl orange (MO), rhodamine-B (RhB), cresol red (CR), and P-nitroaniline (P-Nitro) dyes has shown the excellent degradation efficiencies 88.5%, 93.5%, 75.9%, 98.8%, and 98.6% at 5 ppm dye concentration and 82.6%, 83.6%, 64.3%, 93.1%, and 94.3% at 10 ppm dye concentration in 100 min, respectively, under sunlight illumination. The higher degradation is due to the generation of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. The recyclability test showed the reusability of catalyst up to the 5th cycle. The antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus Vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria with the zone of inhibition 30, 31, 30, 30, and 30 mm, respectively, was achieved.","10.1007/s11356-021-13572-8

33787713,Use of MALDI-TOF for identification and surveillance of gram-negative bacteria in captive wild psittacines.,Brazilian journal of biology = Revista brasleira de biologia,"Microbiological studies of the sanitary and health status of psittacine birds that will be reintroduced is important in evaluating whether these animals act as carriers of pathogenic agents to other animals and humans. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a faster and more accurate method to identify bacteria than conventional microbiology methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the health status of psittacines housed in captivity, by assessment of Gram-negative bacteria from fecal microbiota through MALDI- TOF MS identification. The results indicate high frequency of Gram-negative bacteria in feces (96.5%), especially from the Enterobacteriaceae family (88.7%). The most prevalent bacteria were Escherichia coli (39.0%), Proteus vulgaris (12.2%), Klebsiella spp. (12.1%) and Raoultella ornithinolytica (8.7%). Proteus hauseri, Citrobacter spp., Morganella morgannii, Providencia rettgeri, Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia hermannii were isolated with lower frequency. . All these agents are potentially pathogenic for parrots and can cause systemic infections in other animals and humans. These findings reinforce that MALDI- TOF MS proved to be a rapid and accurate method of identification of the microorganism and evaluation of the health status of psittacines, providing relevant data to assist decision-making regarding the sanitary protocols in wildlife centers, and possible future reintroduction of wild birds.",10.1590/1519-6984.233523,"[{'lastname': 'Davies', 'firstname': 'Y M', 'initials': 'YM', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo - USP, Departamento de Patologia da Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Franco', 'firstname': 'L S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo - USP, Departamento de Patologia da Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Barbosa', 'firstname': 'F B', 'initials': 'FB', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo - USP, Departamento de Patologia da Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Vanin', 'firstname': 'C L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Fauna da Secretaria de Infraestrutura e Meio Ambiente do estado de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Gomes', 'firstname': 'V T M', 'initials': 'VTM', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo - USP, Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal da Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Moreno', 'firstname': 'L Z', 'initials': 'LZ', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo - USP, Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal da Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Barbosa', 'firstname': 'M R F', 'initials': 'MRF', 'affiliation': 'Companhia Ambiental do Estado de São Paulo - CETESB, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Sato', 'firstname': 'M I Z', 'initials': 'MIZ', 'affiliation': 'Companhia Ambiental do Estado de São Paulo - CETESB, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Moreno', 'firstname': 'A M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo - USP, Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal da Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Knöbl', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo - USP, Departamento de Patologia da Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}]"

33264954,Enhancement of dicarboximide fungicide degradation by two bacterial cocultures of Providencia stuartii JD and Brevundimonas naejangsanensis J3.,Journal of hazardous materials,"Bioremediation is commonly conducted by microbial consortia rather than individual species in natural environments. Biodegradation of dicarboximide fungicides in brunisolic soil were significantly enhanced by two bacterial cocultures of Providencia stuartii JD and Brevundimonas naejangsanensis J3. The cocultures degraded 98.42 %, 95.44 %, and 96.81 % of 50 mg/L dimethachlon, iprodione, and procymidone in liquid culture within 6 d respectively, whose efficiency was 1.23 and 1.26, 1.25 and 1.23, and 1.24 and 1.24 times of strains JD and J3, respectively. The cocultures could effectively degrade dimethachlon, iprodione and procymidone to simple products. Moreover, the cocultures immobilized in a charcoal-alginate-chitosan carrier obviously surpassed free cocultures in terms of degradability, stability and reusability. In the field brunisolic soils treated by immobilized cocultures, 96.74 % of 20.25 kg a.i./ha dimethachlon, 95.02 % of 7.50 kg a.i./ha iprodione and 96.27 % of 7.50 kg a.i./ha procymidone were degraded after 7 d, respectively. Moreover, the lower half-lifes (1.53, 1.59 and 1.57 d) by immobilized cocultures were observed, as compared to free cocultures (3.60, 4.03 and 3.92 d) and natural dissipation (21.33, 20.51 and 20.09 d).

33230628,The effect of oropharyngeal aspiration before position change on reducing the incidence of ventilator- associated pneumonia.,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of oropharyngeal aspiration on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence just prior to changing patient position. This randomized controlled experimental study was conducted between July 2015 and April 2019 in anesthesiology and reanimation of intensive care unit (ICU). The patients of experimental group underwent oropharyngeal aspiration under surgical aseptic conditions before each position change. Patients of the control group received oropharyngeal aspiration only as needed. The mean age of the patients was 62.87 ± 17.33 years. The mean and median duration of stay in the ICU were 27.28 ± 30.69 and 18.00 days respectively. The mean and median of duration of the mechanical ventilation support were 26.72 ± 30.65 and 18.00 (min 4; max 168) days respectively. Thirty percent of the patients were VAP. The mean duration of VAP development was 7.50 ± 5.07 days. The rate of VAP development was 11.23/1000 mechanical ventilator days. Only 8.3% of the experimental group patients developed VAP; 91.7% of the control group patients developed VAP. The VAP rate in the control group was 16.82/1000 mechanical ventilator days and the VAP rate in the experimental group was 2.41/1000 mechanical ventilator days. Most VAP agents were multidrug resistant. Distribution of isolated microorganisms was as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Corynebacterium striatum, Staphylococcus aureus, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Aspergillus flavus. In our study, it was concluded that oropharyngeal aspiration performed prior to patient position change prevented the development of VAP.","10.1007/s10096-019-03789-4

This cross-sectional study evaluated 103 Polish adults with CF the following: • The occurrence of PA and the level of bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics; • Type of mutation in the CFTR gene; • Nutritional status assessed by body mass index (BMI), and • Lung function measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%).
The absence or presence of PA and the level of bacterial resistance were significantly related to the type of gene mutation (P < 0.001). In patients with a severe mutation, PA more often was extensively drug resistant or pandrug resistant compared with Pseudomonas culture-negative patients or patients with mild or unclassified mutations on both alleles. Associations were found between the presence of PA and lower values of BMI (P < 0.001), and FEV1% (P < 0.001).

This study aimed to explore the anti-biofilm efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) using nano-emodin (N-EMO) against multi-species bacterial biofilms containing Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii.
Following synthesis and confirmation of N-EMO as a sonosensitizer, the anti-biofilm efficacy of SDT against multi-species bacterial biofilms was determined using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC), and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of N-EMO. The reduction of multi-species bacterial biofilms was then evaluated following the treatments using Log reduction and crystal violet (CV) assays. In addition, the expression profiling of abaI, agrA, and lasI genes using SDT with sub-MIC, sub-MBIC, and sub-MBEC of N-EMO was assessed.
Successful synthesis of N-EMO was confirmed through several characterization tests. As the results demonstrated, the MIC value of N-EMO for the multi-species bacterial suspension was 0.15 × 10

In this retrospective study, demographics, clinical characteristics and relevant laboratory parameters were compared among adult Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2012 and 2017.
A total of 388 adults had radiology-confirmed bronchiectasis and 258 (66%) were Aboriginal. Compared to non-Aboriginal patients, Aboriginal patients were significantly younger (mean age 54 v 67 years), the majority lived in rural and remote communities (80% v 9 %), had higher rates of self-reported smoking (52% v 19%), alcohol consumption (29% v 12%) and co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (65% v 38%) and other chronic co-morbidities. Sputum microbiology was also different between the groups with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis being more common in Aboriginal patients, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus species and non-tuberculous mycobacteria were higher in non-Aboriginal patients. Further, Aboriginal patients had poorer lung function compared to non-Aboriginal patients (forced expiratory volume after 1 second predicted 33% v 53%, forced vital capacity predicted 49% v 60% respectively), higher exacerbation rates (29% v 18%) and poorer overall outcomes (age at death 60 v 76 years).

This study aims to investigate the antimicrobial effects of biochar whose beneficial effects on agricultural productivity has been proven by different studies. Scientific literature concerning the antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral effects of the apricot seed and olive seed biochar is limited. Biochar applications may help to alter the microbial diversity by modifying biological environment either in agriculture or in animal husbandry. Moreover, biochar has been used in animal husbandry to improve animal health especially by regulating the intestinal flora and inflammation in the intestines. Hence, in our study, we investigated the effect of biochar on the growth of Aspergillus niger, Cryphonectria parasitica, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Plenodomus tracheiphilus, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and two different bacteriophage strains. Biochar did not have a direct effect on the growth of neither Gram positive nor Gram negative bacteria, bacteriophages and fungi.

33835234,Complete Genome Sequence of a Novel Bacteriophage RpY1 Infecting Ralstonia solanacearum Strains.,Current microbiology,"Ralstonia solanacearum species complex is deleterious plant pathogenic bacteria causing bacterial wilt in the members of solanaceous crops and the bacterial wilt is difficult to control. Bacteriophages-based biocontrol is an environmentally friendly and promising strategy to control bacterial plant diseases. In this study, we isolated 72 phages from the various crop cultivated soils in Korea using five different strains of R. solanacearum. Among 72 phages, phage RpY1 was selected for further study based on the specificity of the targeted host. This phage was identified as a member of Podoviridae with a head measuring 60-70 nm in length and short tail according to the morphology of transmission electron microscopy images. The genome size of phage RpY1 is 43,284 bp with G + C content of 61.4% and 53 open reading frames (ORFs), including 18 annotated ORFs and 35 hypothetical proteins. This phage genome showed no homology to the genome of known phages except for the DU_RP_II phage infecting R. solanacearum; however, the host range of phage RpY1 is much narrower than that of DU_RP_II.","10.1007/s00284-021-02466-0

33830599,"D-canavanine affects peptidoglycan structure, morphogenesis and fitness in Rhizobiales.",Environmental microbiology,"The bacterial cell wall is made of peptidoglycan (PG), a polymer that is essential for maintenance of cell shape and survival. Many bacteria alter their PG chemistry as a strategy to adapt their cell wall to external challenges. Therefore, identifying these environmental cues is important to better understand the interplay between microbes and their habitat. Here we used the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida to uncover cell wall modulators from plant extracts and found canavanine (CAN), a non-proteinogenic amino acid. We demonstrated that cell wall chemical editing by CAN is licensed by P. putida BSAR, a broad-spectrum racemase which catalyzes production of DL-CAN from L-CAN, which is produced by many legumes. Importantly, D-CAN diffuses to the extracellular milieu thereby having a potential impact on other organisms inhabiting the same niche. Our results show that D-CAN alters dramatically the PG structure of Rhizobiales (e.g. Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti), impairing PG crosslinkage and cell division. Using A. tumefaciens we demonstrated that the detrimental effect of D-CAN is suppressed by a single amino acid substitution in the cell division PG transpeptidase penicillin binding protein 3a. Collectively, this work highlights the role of amino acid racemization in cell wall chemical editing and fitness. This article is protected by copyright.

33824341,Biochemical and structural characterization of the BioZ enzyme engaged in bacterial biotin synthesis pathway.,Nature communications,"Biotin is an essential micro-nutrient across the three domains of life. The paradigm earlier step of biotin synthesis denotes ""BioC-BioH"" pathway in Escherichia coli. Here we report that BioZ bypasses the canonical route to begin biotin synthesis. In addition to its origin of Rhizobiales, protein phylogeny infers that BioZ is domesticated to gain an atypical role of β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III. Genetic and biochemical characterization demonstrates that BioZ catalyzes the condensation of glutaryl-CoA (or ACP) with malonyl-ACP to give 5'-keto-pimeloyl ACP. This intermediate proceeds via type II fatty acid synthesis (FAS II) pathway, to initiate the formation of pimeloyl-ACP, a precursor of biotin synthesis. To further explore molecular basis of BioZ activity, we determine the crystal structure of Agrobacterium tumefaciens BioZ at 1.99 Å, of which the catalytic triad and the substrate-loading tunnel are functionally defined. In particular, we localize that three residues (S84, R147, and S287) at the distant bottom of the tunnel might neutralize the charge of free C-carboxyl group of the primer glutaryl-CoA. Taken together, this study provides molecular insights into the BioZ biotin synthesis pathway.","10.1038/s41467-021-22360-4

33827669,First report of the molecular detection of human pathogen Rickettsia raoultii in ticks from the Republic of Korea.,Parasites & vectors,"Rickettsial diseases associated with the spotted fever group constitute a growing number of newly identified Rickettsia pathogens and their tick vectors in various parts of the world. At least 15 distinct tick species belonging to six genera have shown the presence of Rickettsia raoultii. Herein, we report the detection of R. raoultii in ticks from the Republic of Korea (ROK).
Thirty-five ticks were collected from 29 patients with tick bites in Gwangju Metropolitan City, Jeollanam Province, ROK. The ticks were identified using molecular, morphological, and taxonomic characteristics. All samples were screened for presence of Rickettsia species using nested polymerase chain reactions of their outer membrane protein (ompA) and citrate synthase (gltA) genes. The amplified products were sequenced for subsequent phylogenetic analyses.
Sequencing data showed the DNA sequences of R. raoultii in three Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks. All three tick samples were 99.4-100% similar to previously reported partial sequences of ompA of R. raoultii strains CP019435 and MF002523, which formed a single clade with the reference strains.
We provide the first description and molecular identification of R. raoultii detected in H. longicornis ticks in the ROK. This observation extends the geographical distribution of R. raoultii. Screening of human samples for this pathogen will provide information about the prevalence of rickettsial infections in this region.","10.1186/s13071-021-04695-5

Horses are the primary hosts of the main vector, Amblyomma sculptum, and are considered efficient sentinels for circulation of Rickettsia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect antibodies reactive to R. rickettsii antigens in horses from a non-endemic area in the north-central region of Bahia state, Brazil. Blood samples and ticks were collected from 70 horses from the municipalities of Senhor do Bonfim, Antônio Gonçalves, Pindobaçu, and Campo Formoso. The sera obtained were tested by an indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-Rickettsia antibodies. Overall, 5.7% (4/70) of the horses reacted to R. rickettsii antigens. Ticks were collected from 18.6% (13/70) of the horses and were identified as A. sculptum and Dermacentor nitens. Despite being a non-endemic area, seropositive animals were identified in our study, suggesting circulation of rickettsial agents in the region. This is the first serological survey of this agent in horses from the north-central region of Bahia, and further studies are needed to understand the epidemiology of BSF in these locations.",10.1590/S1984-29612021011,"[{'lastname': 'Farias', 'firstname': 'Ila Ferreira', 'initials': 'IF', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Doenças Parasitárias, Universidade Federal do Vale do São Francisco - UNIVASF, Petrolina, PE, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Souza', 'firstname': 'Eline Almeida Rodrigues de', 'initials': 'EAR', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Doenças Parasitárias, Universidade Federal do Vale do São Francisco - UNIVASF, Petrolina, PE, Brasil.\nPrograma de Pós-graduação em Biociência Animal, Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco - UFRPE, Recife, PE, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Serpa', 'firstname': 'Maria Carolina de Azevedo', 'initials': 'MCA', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Palha', 'firstname': 'Flávio Silva', 'initials': 'FS', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Doenças Parasitárias, Universidade Federal do Vale do São Francisco - UNIVASF, Petrolina, PE, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Oliveira', 'firstname': 'Glauber Meneses Barboza de', 'initials': 'GMB', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Labruna', 'firstname': 'Marcelo Bahia', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, São Paulo, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Horta', 'firstname': 'Mauricio Claudio', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Doenças Parasitárias, Universidade Federal do Vale do São Francisco - UNIVASF, Petrolina, PE, Brasil.'}]"

Some of these pathogens can cause severe diseases in humans, including anaplasmosis, rickettsioses, and ehrlichiosis. Previous studies in South Korea have investigated tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) residing in ticks found on grassy vegetation and animals. However, there is limited phylogenetic information on TBPs in ticks parasitizing Korean water deer (KWD; Hydropotes inermis argyropus). This study evaluated the prevalence, risk factors (regions, tick stages, and tick species), and coinfections of TBPs in ticks parasitizing KWD. Were collected a total of 283 hard ticks, including Haemaphysalis longicornis, Haemaphysalis flava, and Ixodes nipponensis from KWD in South Korea from 2013 to 2017. In 173 tested tick pools, genes for seven TBPs, namely Rickettsia raoultii (20 %), Rickettsia tamurae (1 %), Candidatus Rickettsia longicornii (31 %), Ehrlichia canis (3 %), Anaplasma capra (3 %), Anaplasma bovis (2 %), and Anaplasma sp. (1 %), were detected. The unidentified Anaplasma sp. isolates revealed a 98.4 %-99.3 % sequence identity with Anaplasma sp. in GenBank sequences obtained from ticks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the presence of the emerging human pathogen R. tamurae in South Korea.

33035476,The role of louse-transmitted diseases in historical plague pandemics.,The Lancet. Infectious diseases,"The rodent-murine ectoparasite-human model of plague transmission does not correspond with historical details around plague pandemics in Europe. New analysis of ancient genomes reveal that Yersinia pestis was unable to be transmitted by rat fleas until around 4000 Before Present, which challenges the rodent-murine ectoparasite-human model of plague transmission and historical details around plague pandemics in Europe. In this Review, we summarise data regarding Y pestis transmission by human lice in the context of genomic evolution and co-transmission of other major epidemic deadly pathogens throughout human history, with the aim of broadening our view of plague transmission. Experimental models support the efficiency of human lice as plague vectors through infected faeces, which suggest that Y pestis could be a louse-borne disease, similar to Borrelia recurrentis, Rickettsia prowazekii, and Bartonella quintana. Studies have shown that louse-borne outbreaks often involve multiple pathogens, and several cases of co-transmission of Y pestis and B quintana have been reported. Furthermore, an exclusive louse-borne bacterium, namely B recurrentis, was found to be circulating in northern Europe during the second plague pandemic (14th-18th century). Current data make it possible to attribute large historical pandemics to multiple bacteria, and suggests that human lice probably played a preponderant role in the interhuman transmission of plague and pathogen co-transmission during previous large epidemics, including plague pandemics.",10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30487-4,"[{'lastname': 'Barbieri', 'firstname': 'Rémi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Université, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, Microbes, Evolution, Phylogénie et Infection, Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille Université, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Établissement Français du Sang, Anthropologie Bio-culturelle, Droit, Éthique et Santé, Marseille, France; Fondation Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Drancourt', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Université, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, Microbes, Evolution, Phylogénie et Infection, Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Raoult', 'firstname': 'Didier', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Université, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, Microbes, Evolution, Phylogénie et Infection, Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Fondation Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.

We used paleoserology as a complementary approach detecting specific antibodies under a mini line-blot format including positive and negative control antigens.
Mini line blot assay incorporated skim milk as negative control, Staphylococcus aureus as positive control, and antigens prepared from lice-borne pathogens Rickettsia prowazekii, Borrelia recurrentis, Bartonella quintana, and Yersinia pestis. Paleoserums were extracted from rehydrated dental pulp recovered from buried individuals. Mini line blots observed with the naked eye, were quantified using a scanner and appropriate software. Paleoserology was applied to the indirect detection of lice-borne pathogens in seven skeletons exhumed from a 16th-17th century suspected military burial site (Auxi-le-Château); and 14 civils exhumed from a 5th-13th century burial site (Saint-Mont). Direct detection of pathogens was performed using quantitative real-time PCR.
In Auxi-le-Château, paleoserology yielded 7/7 interpretable paleoserums including 7/7 positives for B. recurrentis including one also positive for B. quintana. In Saint-Mont, paleoserology yielded 8/14 interpretable paleoserums and none reacted against any of the four pathogens. Antibodies against R. prowazekii and Y. pestis were not detected. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in the military burial site of Auxi-le-Château than in the civil burial site of Saint-Mont. Real-time PCR detection of B. quintana yielded 5/21 positive (3 at Saint-Mont and 2 at Auxi-le-Château) whereas B. recurrentis was not detected.

32782016,Molecular identification of head lice collected in Franceville (Gabon) and their associated bacteria.,Parasites & vectors,"Pediculus humanus, which includes two ecotypes (body and head lice), is an obligate bloodsucking parasite that co-evolved with their human hosts over thousands of years, thus providing a valuable source of information to reconstruct the human migration. Pediculosis due to head lice occurred each year throughout the world and several pathogenic bacteria, which are usually associated with body lice, are increasingly detected in them. In Gabon, where this pediculosis is still widespread, there is a lack of data on genetic diversity of head lice and their associated bacteria.
This study aimed to investigate the phylogeny of head lice collected in Gabon and their associated bacteria, using molecular tools. Between 26 March and 11 April 2018, 691 head lice were collected from 86 women in Franceville. We studied the genetic diversity of these lice based on the cytochrome b gene, then we screened them for DNA of Bartonella quintana, Borrelia spp., Acinetobacter spp., Yersinia pestis, Rickettsia spp., R. prowazekii, Anaplasma spp. and C. burnetii, using real time or standard PCR and sequencing.
Overall 74.6% of studied lice belonged to Clade A, 25.3% to Clade C and 0.1% to Clade E. The phylogenetic analysis of 344 head lice yielded 45 variable positions defining 13 different haplotypes from which 8 were novel. Bacterial screening revealed the presence of Borrelia spp. DNA in 3 (0.4%) of 691 head lice belonging to Clade A and infesting one individual. This Borrelia is close to B. theileri (GenBank: MN621894). Acinetobacter spp. DNA has been detected in 39 (25%) of the 156 screened lice; of these 13 (8.3%) corresponded to A. baumannii. Acinetobacter nosocomialis (n = 2) and A. pittii (n = 1) were also recorded.
To of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the genetic diversity of head lice from Gabon. It appears that Clade C is the second most important clade in Gabon, after Clade A which is known to have a global distribution. The detection of Borrelia spp. DNA in these lice highlight the potential circulation of these bacteria in Gabon.",10.1186/s13071-020-04293-x,"[{'lastname': 'Boumbanda-Koyo', 'firstname': 'Celia Scherelle', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': ""Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, SSA, VITROME, Marseille, France.\nIHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.\nUnité d'Evolution, Epidémiologie et Résistances Parasitaires (UNEEREP), Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF), B.P. 769, Franceville, Gabon.\nEcole Doctorale Régionale en Infectiologie Tropicale d'Afrique Centrale, B.P. 876, Franceville, Gabon.""}, {'lastname': 'Mediannikov', 'firstname': 'Oleg', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'IHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France. oleguss1@gmail.com.\nAix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, MEPHI, Marseille, France. oleguss1@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Amanzougaghene', 'firstname': 'Nadia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'IHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.\nAix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, MEPHI, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Oyegue-Liabagui', 'firstname': 'Sandrine Lydie', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': ""Ecole Doctorale Régionale en Infectiologie Tropicale d'Afrique Centrale, B.P. 876, Franceville, Gabon.""}, {'lastname': 'Imboumi-Limoukou', 'firstname': 'Roméo Karl', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': ""Unité d'Evolution, Epidémiologie et Résistances Parasitaires (UNEEREP), Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF), B.P. 769, Franceville, Gabon.""}, {'lastname': 'Raoult', 'firstname': 'Didier', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'IHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.\nAix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, MEPHI, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lekana-Douki', 'firstname': 'Jean Bernard', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': ""Unité d'Evolution, Epidémiologie et Résistances Parasitaires (UNEEREP), Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF), B.P. 769, Franceville, Gabon.\nEcole Doctorale Régionale en Infectiologie Tropicale d'Afrique Centrale, B.P. 876, Franceville, Gabon.\nDépartement de Parasitologie-Mycologie et Médecine Tropicale, Faculté de Médecine, Université des Sciences de la Santé (USS), B.P. 4009, Libreville, Gabon.""}, {'lastname': 'Fenollar', 'firstname': 'Florence', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, SSA, VITROME, Marseille, France.\nIHU-Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.'}]"

33830980,"Use of Real-Time PCR for Chlamydia psittaci Detection in Human Specimens During an Outbreak of Psittacosis - Georgia and Virginia, 2018.",MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,"Psittacosis is typically a mild febrile respiratory illness caused by infection with the bacterium Chlamydia psittaci and usually transmitted to humans by infected birds (1). On average, 11 psittacosis cases per year were reported in the United States during 2000-2017. During August-October 2018, the largest U.S. psittacosis outbreak in 30 years (82 cases identified*) occurred in two poultry slaughter plants, one each in Virginia and Georgia, that shared source farms (2). CDC used C. psittaci real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test 54 human specimens from this outbreak. This was the largest number of human specimens from a single outbreak ever tested for C. psittaci using real-time PCR, which is faster and more sensitive than commercially available serologic tests. This represented a rare opportunity to assess the utility of multiple specimen types for real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci. C. psittaci was detected more frequently in lower respiratory specimens (59% [10 of 17]) and stool (four of five) than in upper respiratory specimens (7% [two of 28]). Among six patients with sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs tested, C. psittaci was detected only in sputum in five patients. Cycle threshold (Ct) values suggested bacterial load was higher in lower respiratory specimens than in nasopharyngeal swabs. These findings support prioritizing lower respiratory specimens for real-time PCR detection of C. psittaci. Stool specimens might also have utility for diagnosis of psittacosis.",10.15585/mmwr.mm7014a1,"[{'lastname': 'McGovern', 'firstname': 'Olivia L', 'initials': 'OL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kobayashi', 'firstname': 'Miwako', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Shaw', 'firstname': 'Kelly A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Szablewski', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gabel', 'firstname': 'Julie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Holsinger', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Drenzek', 'firstname': 'Cherie', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Brennan', 'firstname': 'Skyler', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Milucky', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Farrar', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wolff', 'firstname': 'Bernard J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Benitez', 'firstname': 'Alvaro J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Thurman', 'firstname': 'Kathleen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Diaz', 'firstname': 'Maureen H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Winchell', 'firstname': 'Jonas M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Schrag', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]"
33774629,Mucosal Respiratory Syndrome: A Systematic Literature Review.,"Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)","Mycoplasma pneumoniae atypical pneumonia is frequently associated with erythema multiforme. Occasionally, a mycoplasma infection does not trigger any cutaneous but exclusively mucosal lesions. The term mucosal respiratory syndrome is employed to denote the latter condition. Available reviews do not address the possible association of mucosal respiratory syndrome with further atypical bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, or Legionella species. We therefore performed a systematic review of the literature addressing this issue in the National Library of Medicine, Excerpta Medica, and Web of Science databases.
We found 63 patients (≤18 years, n = 36; >18 years, n = 27; 54 males and 9 females) affected by a mucosal respiratory syndrome. Fifty-three cases were temporally associated with a M. pneumoniae and 5 with a C. pneumoniae infection.

33463503,[Clinical characteristics analysis of patients with pneumonia infected by Chlamydia psittaci].,Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,"To explore the clinical characteristics of pneumonia infected by Chlamydophila psittaci (C. psittaci).
A retrospective analysis was performed on 3 cases of C. psittaci pneumonia admitted to People's Hospital of Tongling City from July 2019 to January 2020. The patients' contact history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination, imaging characteristics and evolution, etiology, treatment process and outcome were analyzed, so as to provide experience for the diagnosis and prevention of C. psittaci pneumonia.
The 3 patients had been infected through pet or zoonotic exposures. All symptoms included high fever (body temperature > 39 centigrade), cough, sputum, chest tightness and dyspnea. The disease progressed rapidly, with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock as the main manifestations, but the damages to the heart, liver and kidney were mild. Laboratory tests showed that C-reactive protein (CRP, all > 200 mg/L) and neutrophil proportion (Neut%, > 0.90) were significantly increased, while white blood cell count (WBC) and procalcitonin (PCT) were not significantly increased. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed inflammatory infiltration with interstitial changes, either unilateral or bilateral. Chest X-ray showed large areas of inflammatory infiltrations, fan-shaped or wedge-shaped to the edge of pleura. After 7 days of treatment, the bedside computed X-ray (CR) showed absorption of infiltration. After 11-13 days, the CT reexamination indicated lung infection was basically absorbed. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) confirmed the presence of C. psittaci in patients' sputum. It was sensitive to quinolones and tetracyclines. The patients' body temperature dropped to normal after 2-3 days of antibiotics, and all patients were extubated and transferred to normal ward 10 days later. The total course of illness was 20-30 days.
The patients with C. psittaci pneumonia are critically ill, and clinical manifestations of moderate to severe ARDS and shock are common.

The Tygerberg Endocarditis Cohort (TEC) study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of patients with confirmed or suspected IE presenting to Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Current analysis includes patients that presented between November 2019 and August 2020. Forty four (44) patients have been included in this ongoing study. Fourteen of the 44 patients (31.8%) had BCNE. Further analysis of the patients with BCNE identified Bartonella species as the most common causative organism (n=6; 43%). Other causes included Mycoplasma species (n=2). No cause could be identified in 4 of the 44 patients (9%). Bartonella quintana was identified with PCR of valvular tissue as the causative organism in 4 of the 5 patients that underwent urgent surgery. The patients with Bartonella IE (n=6) had an average age of 39 years with equal gender distribution. The common clinical features were clubbing (n=5; 83%), anemia (n=4; 66.6%), haematuria (n=3; 50%), acute on chronic severe regurgitant lesion (n=3; 50%) and acute severe regurgitant lesion (n=2; 33.3%).The aortic valve was involved in 5 of 6 patients. During a mean follow-up period of 251 days after diagnosis, no major adverse events occurred. Bartonella-associated IE is an important cause of BCNE in the Western Cape of South Africa. Imaging findings (in patients with BCNE) of significant valvular destruction with large vegetations on the aortic valve not affected by congenital or rheumatic valve disease should raise the suspicion of Bartonella-associated IE.","10.1007/s10096-021-04239-w

33797675,Clinical profile and visual outcome of intraocular inflammation associated with cat-scratch disease in Japanese patients.,Japanese journal of ophthalmology,"To evaluate intraocular inflammation in Japanese patients with cat-scratch disease (CSD).
Retrospective clinical chart review.
The cases of 15 consecutive patients (19 affected eyes) in Kochi Prefecture, Japan who were serologically positive for Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana infection in association with intraocular inflammation were reviewed. The clinical manifestations, ocular complications, and treatment modalities were recorded. The clinical charts and photographic records were also reviewed for evidence of optic disc lesions, macular star, foci of chorioretinitis, and other findings.
Thirteen patients reported fever before or at the time of the initial presentation. Ten of 11 patients with decreased visual acuity manifested neuroretinitis, and the remaining patient showed retinochoroiditis with macular involvement. One patient with a visual field defect manifested branch retinal artery occlusion. Three patients without visual disturbance presented with fever of unknown cause. Discrete white retinal or retinochoroidal lesions were the most common findings (84% of eyes, 87% of patients), followed by retinal hemorrhage (63% of eyes, 80% of patients), optic disc lesions (63% of eyes, 73% of patients), serous retinal detachment (53% of eyes, 67% of patients), and macular star (47% of eyes, 60% of patients).
White retinal or retinochoroidal foci were the most common ocular posterior segment manifestations of CSD in this patient population. A diagnosis of CSD should be suspected in patients with fever and chorioretinal white spots, and the absence of neuroretinitis or macular star does not exclude the possibility of intraocular inflammation in CSD.","10.1007/s10384-021-00835-7

The cellular sanctuary of B. quintana in-between febrile relapses remains unknown but repeated detection of B. quintana in dental pulp specimens suggested long-term half-life dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) as candidates. As the capacity of DPSCs to internalize microscopic particles was unknown, we confirmed that DPSCs internalized B. quintana bacteria: Gimenez staining and fluorescence microscopy localized B. quintana bacteria inside DPSCs and this internalization did not affect the cellular multiplication of DPSCs during a one-month follow-up despite the increase in the bacterial load. B. quintana-infected DPSCs did not produce Tumor Necrosis Factor-α whereas an important production of Monocytes Chemoattractant Protein-1 was observed. These unprecedented observations suggest the possibility that DPSCs are shelters for the long-term persistence of B. quintana in the host, warranting further experimental and clinical investigations.",10.1016/j.micpath.2021.104797,"[{'lastname': 'Oumarou Hama', 'firstname': 'Hamadou', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamada', 'firstname': 'Attoumani', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Aboudharam', 'firstname': 'Gérard', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; UFR Odontologie, Aix-Marseille-Université, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghigo', 'firstname': 'Éric', 'initials': 'É', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, SSA, VITROME, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Drancourt', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.

Horses are the primary hosts of the main vector, Amblyomma sculptum, and are considered efficient sentinels for circulation of Rickettsia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect antibodies reactive to R. rickettsii antigens in horses from a non-endemic area in the north-central region of Bahia state, Brazil. Blood samples and ticks were collected from 70 horses from the municipalities of Senhor do Bonfim, Antônio Gonçalves, Pindobaçu, and Campo Formoso. The sera obtained were tested by an indirect immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-Rickettsia antibodies. Overall, 5.7% (4/70) of the horses reacted to R. rickettsii antigens. Ticks were collected from 18.6% (13/70) of the horses and were identified as A. sculptum and Dermacentor nitens. Despite being a non-endemic area, seropositive animals were identified in our study, suggesting circulation of rickettsial agents in the region.

Feeding primarily on dogs, members of the complex also feed incidentally on humans, potentially transmitting disease agents such as Rickettsia rickettsii, R. conorii, and Ehrlichia species. There are two genetic Rh. sanguineus lineages in North America, designated as the temperate and tropical lineages, which had occurred in discrete locations, although there is now range overlap in parts of California and Arizona. Rh. sanguineus in Europe are reportedly more aggressive toward humans during hot weather, increasing the risk of pathogen transmission to humans. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of hot weather on choice between humans and dog hosts among tropical and temperate lineage Rh. sanguineus individuals. Ticks in a two-choice olfactometer migrated toward a dog or human in trials at room (23.5°C) or high temperature (38°C). At 38°C, 2.5 times more tropical lineage adults chose humans compared with room temperature, whereas temperate lineage adults demonstrated a 66% reduction in preference for dogs and a slight increase in preference for humans. Fewer nymphs chose either host at 38°C than at room temperature in both lineages. These results demonstrate that risk of disease transmission to humans may be increased during periods of hot weather, where either lineage is present, and that hot weather events associated with climatic change may result in more frequent rickettsial disease outbreaks.",10.4269/ajtmh.20-1376,"[{'lastname': 'Backus', 'firstname': 'Laura H', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'López Pérez', 'firstname': 'Andrés M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Foley', 'firstname': 'Janet E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': None}]"

33834999,Unusual Clinical Presentation of Giant Extragenital Condyloma.,Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC,"Dear editor, Condylomata accuminatum (CA) is a human papillomavirus (HPV) related sexually transmitted infection (STI), clinically characterized by solitary or even clustered dark red or pink lesions solely affecting the anogenital area (1). CA involving the extragenital, non-mucosal skin has been sporadically reported (2-4). Diagnosis of CA is usually straightforward when the lesions are located on the anogenital area. However, involvement of extragenital skin may pose a diagnostic challenge. Herein, we report a rare case of giant linear extragenital CA without coexisting genital lesions, diagnosed with a synergic intervention of dermatoscopy and clinics. A 70-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our department for an atypical asymptomatic seborrheic keratosis presenting as a linear verrucous plaque (20 × 2 cm) with few solitary reddish satellite papules on the abdomen (Figure 1, a). No similar lesions were present in both cutaneous and mucosal districts. Medical history was unremarkable, and the patient denied having recent sexual intercourse or any history of condylomas. Remarkably, the patient underwent a diet in the last 8 months that resulted in a loss of 30 kg. We employed dermatoscopy to further assess the lesions, highlighting a finger-like pattern on the main lesion (Figure 1, c), while satellite lesions presented a mosaic pattern (Figure 1, b). The clinical appearance and these dermatoscopic findings were suggestive of condyloma acuminatum (CA), but due to its extraordinary presentation we also performed an incisional biopsy. Histopathological examination reviled features compatible with the diagnosis of CA (Figure 1, d, e). To better characterized the HPV genotype (high-risk and low-risk HPV) a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from lesional tissue sample was performed and found HPV type 6 positivity. The lesions were successfully removed by electrosurgery. Regular follow-up was scheduled. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were also screened, namely syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia trachomatis, and HIV status. In addition, laboratory tests and imaging examinations (radiography of the chest and ultrasound examination of the abdomen) revealed no pathological findings. CA involving the extragenital skin has been reported within intertriginous areas, including the inframammary fold, the groin, and the axillary vault, as well as mucosal surface such as intraoral and conjunctival mucosa (1-5). In most cases, extragenital CA coexisted with genital lesions. Staples et al. reported three obese patients with extragenital CA on the skin of the abdominal pannus (3). However, all of the patients had involvement of the inguinal folds, from where the CA had extended. Generally, CA is acquired by genital, oral, or anal sexual contact. Among the wide spectrum of HPV genotypes, types 6 and 11 are responsible of 90% of CA (1). Our paradigmatic case allows us reflect on the concept of transitory immune dysregulation due to a significant amount of weight loss, and the position of the lesions in particular seems to suggest that frictional triggers may disrupt the barrier integrity, leading to higher probability of infection. Dermoscopy is a noninvasive diagnostic tool with a significant role in the assessment of melanocytic and non-melanocytic skin tumors. Furthermore, the utility of dermatoscopy has expanded to the field of inflammatory and infectious skin disease, where dermoscopy enhances the differential diagnosis between them. Seborrheic keratosis, as the most common benign epithelial tumor, can occur anywhere in the skin excluding the palms, soles, and mucosa (6). In the anogenital area, seborrheic keratosis usually resembles CA. However, dermatoscopically, seborrheic keratosis can be immediately identified by the presence of milia-like cysts, comedo-like openings, fissures, finger-print structures, and sharply demarcated borders (6). In contrast, reports of CA dermoscopy suggested four different dermoscopic patterns: fingerlike, mosaic, knoblike, and the most commonly, an unspecific pattern (7). Our case showed that dermoscopy of extragenital CA presented a mosaic pattern in an early stage of CA, while fully developed lesions revealed a fingerlike pattern, as has previously been reported by Dong et al. (7), where two different stages of clinical development of CA exhibit distinctive dermoscopic patterns, which correlates with our case. We did not observe the typical dermoscopic features of seborrheic keratosis. CA arising in an extragenital area is very rare and perhaps also underestimated.

33833149,Expedited Partner Therapy in Adolescent Females: A Study of Acceptance and the Impact on Reinfection Rates.,Sexually transmitted diseases,"Given the high risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in adolescents and young adults (AYA), this study evaluated expedited partner therapy (EPT) acceptance and STI reinfection rates in AYA females before and after availability of EPT.
The pre-EPT cohort was a 3-year (11/2012-11/2015) retrospective chart review of AYA females positive for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and/or Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) prior to introduction of EPT. An EPT protocol for CT and TV infections was implemented following legalization in Ohio in 2016. The post-EPT cohort was a prospective review of patients positive for CT and TV for 2 years (5/2016-5/2018) after EPT introduction. We evaluated EPT acceptance and compared reinfection rates (positive test 1-6 months after initial infection) in the pre-EPT versus post-EPT cohorts and by EPT acceptance.
Among patients offered EPT, 28% (67/237) with CT and 25% (24/97) with TV accepted EPT. There were no significant differences in the reinfection rates for CT or TV in the pre- versus post-EPT cohorts (CT: 24% (57/240) vs. 20% (38/192), p=0.42; TV: 23% (22/97) versus 14% (12/87), p=0.11). Although lower, reinfections rates were not significantly different among patients who accepted versus did not accept EPT (CT: 13% (6/48) vs. 21% (23/110), p=0.50 and TV: 6% (1/18) vs. 18% (9/49), p=0.69).
Despite the implementation of an EPT protocol, STI reinfection rates among AYA females remained high, and many declined EPT. Further research is needed to identify barriers to the provision and acceptance of EPT and ways to address these factors.",10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001436,"[{'lastname': 'Gannon-Loew', 'firstname': 'Kathryn E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': ""University Health Services, University of Wisconsin-Madison Nationwide Children's Hospital The Ohio State University College of Medicine Columbus Health Department Center for Biostatistics at The Ohio State University Biostatistics Resource at Nationwide Children's Hospital The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital.""}, {'lastname': 'Holland-Hall', 'firstname': 'Cynthia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ebersole', 'firstname': 'Ashley M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Alexy', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jackson', 'firstname': 'Kenneth', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bonny', 'firstname': 'Andrea E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': None}]"

Materials and methods: All the collected samples were assayed for IgM and IgG antibodies to chlamydia trachomatis and chlamydial heat shock protein 60 (CHSP60) by using immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques, respectively.
Results: There were no substantial differences between antibodies to C. trachomatis in females with tubal infertility (67%) and non-tubal infertility (48%). However, women with tubal infertility (45%) have more anti-CHSP60 antibodies than non-tubal infertility (9%). Antibody screening for C. trachomatis has only (63%) sensitivity and (54%) specificity for detecting tubal infertility. On the other hand, the CHSP60 antibody testing has (44%) sensitivity and 92% specificity for diagnosing tubal infertility. A positive microimmunofluorescence (MIF) titer was observed in 12 of 18 (67%) females with the tubal problem, 31 of 64 (48%) with non-tubal infertility (P=0.3, OR=2.2, 95% CI=0.71 to 8.01). The CHSP60 antibodies were found in 8 of 18 (45%) females with tubal problem & 6 of 64 (9%) women with non-tubal infertility, power factor alpha α P=0.004, OR=9.3, 95% CI=2.1 to 43.2, power= 1.002 for n= 0.05). Incorporating CHSP60 and C. trachomatis antibodies testing gives an excellent positive probability proportion of 10 to diagnose C. trachomatis associated tubal infertility.
Conclusions: CHSP60 antibody testing is a more specific evaluation than antibody testing for C. trachomatis for predicting chlamydia-associated tubal infertility. Using these tests at the first infertility examination may help the immediate diagnosis for non-interceptive tubal infertility.",,"[{'lastname': 'Berestoviy', 'firstname': 'Vladyslav O', 'initials': 'VO', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}, {'lastname': 'Sokol', 'firstname': 'Inna V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahmood', 'firstname': 'Ahmad A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}, {'lastname': 'Ginzburg', 'firstname': 'Valentyna G', 'initials': 'VG', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY №3, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}, {'lastname': 'Govsieiev', 'firstname': 'Dmytro O', 'initials': 'DO', 'affiliation': 'DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE; DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, KYIV STATE MATERNITY HOSPITAL №5, KYIV, UKRAINEDEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY OF POSTGRADUATE DEPARTMENT, BOGOMOLETS NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, KYIV, UKRAINE.'}]"

A single case report documented with multimodal imaging.
A 18-year-old woman with a history of high-grade fever was initially diagnosed with typhoid fever and treated with fluoroquinolone. She presented with a 5-day history of diplopia and headaches. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Ocular motility examination showed left lateral gaze restriction. Lancaster test confirmed the presence of left abducens palsy. Fundus examination showed optic disc swelling in both eyes associated with superotemporal retinal hemorrhage and a small retinal infiltrate with retinal hemorrhage in the nasal periphery in the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits showed no abnormalities. A diagnosis of rickettsial disease was suspected and the serologic test for Richettsia Typhi was positive. The patient was treated with doxycycline (100 mg every 12 h) for 15 days with complete recovery of the left lateral rectus motility and resolution of optic disc swelling, retinal hemorrhages, and retinal infiltrate.
Rickettsial disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abducens nerve palsy in any patient with unexplained fever from endemic area. Fundus examination may help establish an early diagnosis and to start an appropriate rickettsial treatment.","10.1186/s12348-021-00239-1

Our objective was to conduct a large scale retrospective investigation to determine the clinical and epidemiological features of patients diagnosed with murine typhus in Greece.
From 2012 to 2019 serum samples from hospitalized patients and outpatients throughout Greece suspected for murine typhus infection were tested by immunofluorescence assay for Rickettsia typhi. Immunofluorescence positive samples obtained since 2016 were also tested by qPCR targeting R. typhi. Clinical and epidemiological data were retrospectively collected for the patients with confirmed murine typhus. Overall, we tested 5,365 different patients and, in total, 174 patients from all geographic regions of Greece were diagnosed with murine typhus. The most frequently reported sign or symptom was fever (89%), followed by headache (84%) and rash (81%). The classical triad of fever, headache, and rash was present in 72% of patients during their illness. Severe infections with complications including acute renal failure or septic shock were not recorded. The majority of cases (81%) occurred during May-October and peaked in June and September. Most of patients (81%) infected in Athens, recalled that their only activity the last weeks before symptoms onset was swimming on the beach and 59% of them also reported an insect bite while sunbathing.

Although cases are often attributed to Rickettsia rickettsii, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, multiple other Rickettsia pathogens are present in North America. We conducted multiple-host surveillance of domestic, synanthropic, and sylvatic mammals and their ectoparasites to investigate the ecology of Rickettsia species in this region. A total of 499 mammals, including 83 dogs, 23 wild carnivores, five lagomorphs, and 388 rodents were sampled, and 413 fleas and 447 ticks belonging to 15 and 4 species, respectively, were collected during 2017 and 2018. We detected Rickettsia spp. DNA in one blood sample of coyote (Canis latrans), 11 ear tissues of rodents (10.6%), and 79 ectoparasites (9.5%). Of the 64 Rickettsia-positive fleas, 54 were Echidnophaga gallinacea and 10 were Pulex simulans, while of the 15 ticks, 11 were Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. and four Ixodes pacificus. The DNA sequence alignment of gltA and ompB regions revealed one and ten genetic variants of Rickettsia spp., respectively. These variants were clustered in clades of zoonotic species (R. felis, R. massiliae, R. parkeri, R. rickettsii, and R. typhi) and organisms of unknown pathogenic significance (R. asembonensis and Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae). The finding of a coyote infected with R. rickettsii and the multiple zoonotic SFG rickettsial agents in the study area suggest that: 1) wild canids could serve as an amplifying host for RMSF, an alternate host for Rh. sanguineus s.l. ticks, and a means to spread infection and ticks over large areas; and 2) at least some of the human rickettsiosis cases attributed to R. rickettsii could be caused by other Rickettsia species.

33822791,Efficacy of a nanoparticle vaccine administered in-ovo against Salmonella in broilers.,PloS one,"Salmonella is a zoonotic pathogen that persists in poultry. Salmonella vaccines that can be delivered in-ovo can be cost-effective and can decrease Salmonella load in poultry. This study evaluates the efficacy of a Salmonella chitosan-nanoparticle (CNP) vaccine, administered in-ovo, in broilers. CNP vaccine was synthesized with Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) outer-membrane-proteins (OMPs) and flagellin proteins. At embryonic-d18, one-hundred-thirty-six eggs were injected with 200μl PBS or 1000μg CNP into the amniotic cavity. At d1-of-age, 132 chicks were allocated in 6 pens/treatment with 11 chicks/pen. At d7, birds were orally challenged with 1×109 CFU/bird SE. At d1, 8h-post-challenge, d14, and d21, serum anti-SE-OMPs IgY were analyzed. At d14 and d21, cloacal swabs and bile anti-SE-OMPs IgA, CD4+/CD8+-T-cell ratios, and ceca SE loads were analyzed. At d21, cecal tonsil IL-1β, IL-10, and iNOS mRNA were analyzed. Body-weight-gain (BWG) and feed-conversion-ratio (FCR) were recorded weekly. Data were analyzed by Student's t-test at P<0.05. There were no significant differences in BWG or FCR between vaccinated birds compared to control. At d1, CNP-vaccinated birds had 5.62% greater levels (P<0.05) of anti-SE-OMPs IgY, compared to control. At 8h-post-challenge, CNP-vaccinated birds had 6.39% greater levels (P<0.05) of anti-SE-OMPs IgY, compared to control. At 2wk-post-challenge, CNP-vaccinated birds had 7.34% lower levels (P<0.05) of anti-SE-OMPs IgY, compared to control. At 1wk-post-challenge, CNP-vaccinated birds had 15.30% greater levels (P<0.05) of bile anti-SE-OMPs IgA, compared to control. At d14 and d21, CNP-vaccinated birds had 0.62 and 0.85 Log10 CFU/g, decreased SE ceca load (P<0.05), respectively, compared to control. There were no significant differences in CD4+/CD8+-T-cell ratios between vaccinated birds compared to control. There were no significant differences in IL-1β, IL-10, iNOS mRNA between vaccinated birds compared to control.

Typhi) and Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) causing significant health problems in developing countries including Ethiopia. Thus present study aimed to determine prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profile of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi among EF suspected patients at Felege-Hiwot comprehensive specialized hospital, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted from March-to-May 2020. Totally, 150 patients were included conveniently. Data were collected using questionnaires by face-to-face interview. Concurrently, venous blood and stool specimens were collected and processed following standard bacteriological technique. Antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) was performed by disc diffusion method. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with EF infection. The study indicated 5.3% EF prevalence where S. Typhi accounted 75%. S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi isolates were 100% sensitive to cephalosporins but at least 83.3% showed resistance against chloramphenicol and tetracycline. At least 66.7% of isolates were multidrug resistance (MDR). Using well water for drinking (AOR = 6.22, CI 1.4-27.5) and previous EF history (AOR = 10.74, CI 2.01-55.9) were significantly associated with EF infection. Thus high bacterial prevalence and MDR isolates was observed. Therefore, health professionals should consider AST and use antibiotics with cautions for EF patient management.",10.1038/s41598-021-86743-9,"[{'lastname': 'Amsalu', 'firstname': 'Tadele', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic Medical Laboratory Unit, Dangila Primary Hospital, Dangila, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Genet', 'firstname': 'Chalachew', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science, College of Medicine and Health Science, Bahir Dar University, P.

33784974,Quinolone resistant Salmonella species isolated from pediatric patients with diarrhea in central Iran.,BMC gastroenterology,"This study aimed to investigate the frequency and the antibiotic resistance patterns of Salmonella species that were isolated from infectious diarrhea samples taken from pediatric patients in central Iran.
The study analyzed 230 stool specimens that were cultured on XLD, MacConkey agar and GN broth. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to identify the Salmonella genus. The antibiotic resistance profiles and the frequency of quinolone and integron genes were obtained.
Out of 230 samples of infectious diarrhea, 21 (9.1%) cases of Salmonella spp. were identified using culture methods. Another 28 (12.1%) samples had positive PCR results, with S. serovar Paratyphi B and C (9/21; 42.8%) and S. Typhi (3/21; 14.3%) being the most recognized. The highest antibiotic resistance rates were found for nalidixic acid (15/21; 71.4%), tetracycline (9/21; 42.8%). However, six (28.5%) of isolates were found resistant to cotrimoxazole, ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Among the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants, qnrS, qnrA, and qnrB were positive in (9/15; 60%), (6/15; 40%) and (3/15; 20%) of the isolates, respectively. Class 1 and 2 integrons were identified in 15 (71.4%) and 3 (14.3%) isolates, respectively.
High rates of quinolone resistant and low frequency of MDR Salmonella spp. isolates were identified in central Iran, similar to findings in other parts of Asia. To prevent the spread of these resistant strains, the antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella spp. isolates should be under constant surveillance, and empiric antibiotic therapy should be adapted appropriately.",10.1186/s12876-021-01719-3,"[{'lastname': 'Abbasi', 'firstname': 'Elnaz', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Islamic Republic of Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghaznavi-Rad', 'firstname': 'Ehsanollah', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Islamic Republic of Iran. ghaznaviehs@yahoo.com.\nMolecular and Medicine Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Islamic Republic of Iran. ghaznaviehs@yahoo.com.\nDepartment of Medical Laboratory Sciences, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran. ghaznaviehs@yahoo.com.'}]"
33830286,Cell surface and extracellular proteins of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri as an effective mediator to regulate intestinal epithelial barrier function.,Archives of microbiology,"The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of cell surface and extracellular proteins in regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) function. Eight potentially probiotic L. reuteri strains were evaluated for presence of mapA gene and its expression on co-culturing with the Caco-2 cells. The ability of untreated (Viable), heat-inactivated, 5 M LiCL treated L. reuteri strains as well as their cell-free supernatant (CFS) to modulate expression of IEB function genes (hBD-2, hBD-3, claudin-1 and occludin) was also evaluated. Caco-2 cells were treated with cell surface and extracellular protein extracts and investigated for change in expression of targeted IEB function genes. The results showed that mapA gene is present in all the tested L. reuteri strains and expression of mapA and its receptors (anxA13 and palm) increase significantly on co-culturing of L. reuteri and Caco-2 cells. Also, up-regulated expression of IEB function genes was observed on co-culturing of L. reuteri (viable, heat-inactivated and CFS) and their protein extracts with Caco-2 cells in contrast to down-regulation observed with the pathogenic strain of Salmonella typhi. Therefore, this study concludes that the cell surface and extracellular protein from L. reuteri act as an effective mediator molecules to regulate IEB function.","10.1007/s00203-021-02318-2

33824912,Engagement of ethics and regulatory authorities on human infection studies: Proceedings of an engagement workshop in Zambia.,Wellcome open research,"Human infection studies (HIS) have generally been used as a tool in the pathway for vaccine development in high income settings. Over the last decade, this model has been implemented in LMICs with the aim of accelerating development of next generation vaccines that would perform better in these settings. However, in most LMICs, the ethics and regulatory framework for the conduct of these studies are not in place. In Zambia, these studies are yet to be conducted and thus we conducted a stakeholder engagement workshop in October 2019. We engaged with bioethicists, regulatory authority, and scientists from within Zambia and other African countries to anticipate and address foreseeable ethical and regulatory issues when conducting HIS in Zambia for the first time. The workshop largely focused on sensitizing the stakeholders on the benefits of these studies with the following main points for consideration on the implementation of these studies in Zambia: need for in-country legal framework and guidelines; need for adequate informed consent based on comprehensive understanding of the concept of HIS and study requirements; and requirements for heightened vigilance to assure participant safety including good ethical and clinical practice with regulatory, ethical, data safety, and community oversight. Additionally, the workshop emphasized the need for rigorous health screening prior to enrolment; suitable infrastructure for containment; and personnel to provide appropriate treatment including emergency resuscitation and evacuation if indicated. Specific recommendations included compensation for burden of participation; access to care and provision for study related injury (e.g. no-fault insurance); and withdrawal and exit procedures to preserve individual and community safety. Finally, the meeting concluded that researchers should actively engage key gate keepers including civic leaders such as parliamentarians, universities, researchers, potential participants and laypersons to avoid circulation of misinformation.",10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16432.1,"[{'lastname': ""Kunda-Ng'andu"", 'firstname': 'Evelyn Muleba', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Simuyandi', 'firstname': 'Michelo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kapulu', 'firstname': 'Melissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Biosciences, KEMRI-Wellcome trust research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya.\nNuffield Department of Medicine, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Chirwa-Chobe', 'firstname': 'Masuzyo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mwanyungwi-Chinganya', 'firstname': 'Hope', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mwale', 'firstname': 'Stanley', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chilengi', 'firstname': 'Roma', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Anjali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}]"

33833292,"Thymol nanoemulsion promoted broiler chicken's growth, gastrointestinal barrier and bacterial community and conferred protection against Salmonella Typhimurium.",Scientific reports,"The present study involved in vivo evaluation of the growth promoting effects of thymol and thymol nanoemulsion and their protection against Salmonella Typhimurium infection in broilers. One-day old 2400 chicks were randomly divided into eight groups; negative and positive control groups fed basal diet without additives and thymol and thymol nanoemulsion groups (0.25, 0.5 and 1% each). At d 23, all chicks except negative control were challenged with S. Typhimurium. Over the total growing period, birds fed 1% thymol nanoemulsion showed better growth performance even after S. Typhimurium challenge, which came parallel with upregulation of digestive enzyme genes (AMY2A, PNLIP and CCK). Additionally, higher levels of thymol nanoemulsion upregulated the expression of MUC-2, FABP2, IL-10, IgA and tight junction proteins genes and downregulated IL-2 and IL-6 genes expression. Moreover, 1% thymol nanoemulsion, and to lesser extent 0.5% thymol nanoemulsion and 1% thymol, corrected the histological alterations of cecum and liver postinfection. Finally, supplementation of 1% thymol, 0.5 and 1% thymol nanoemulsion led to increased Lactobacilli counts and decreased S. Typhimurium populations and downregulated invA gene expression postinfection. This first report of supplying thymol nanoemulsion in broiler diets proved that 1% nano-thymol is a potential growth promoting and antibacterial agent.","10.1038/s41598-021-86990-w

33829377,Three challenging cases of infections by multidrug-resistant Serratia marcescens in patients admitted to intensive care units.,Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society for Microbiology],"The occurrence of multidrug-resistant Serratia marcescens strains represents a serious public health threat. The purpose here is to report three cases of carbapenem-resistant S. marcescens infections with unfavorable clinical outcomes and provide a molecular description of the antibiotic resistance determinants at a genomic level. We performed bacterial identification by VITEK 2 and MALDI-TOF. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobials were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, except for tigecycline, for which they were determined using Etest strips. Preliminary screening for the presence of carbapenemases was performed by ertapenem hydrolysis using MALDI-TOF MS. Whole-genome sequencing was provided to identify genes responsible for virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Here we report three challenging cases of S. marcescens that were resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics. Otherwise, we performed a genome description, which includes several genes involved in the resistance and virulence. These cases illustrate serious infection due to multidrug-resistant organisms and the complexity of treatment. Our results highlight the need to evaluate isolates regularly during long-term hospital stay to achieve optimal quality of clinical care and thus improve patient outcomes.","10.1007/s42770-021-00477-4

Among the 46 isolated strains, 25 presented positive results for lipase production in the agar plate screening assay. Two of these strains that expressed the highest diffusion halos, were genetically identified as Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas fluorescens and catalogued in the Tropical Cultures Collection from the André Tosello Foundation/Brazil as CCT 7796 and CCT 7797, respectively. The fermentation growth kinetics indicated that the maximum extracellular lipase activities were achieved between 96 and 120h of cultivation. The highest lipolytic activity for both strains was observed at an optimum temperature and pH of 37°C and 7.0, respectively. At these conditions, the lipase activity detected in the crude enzymatic extract of both strains was close to 15.0 U/mL. We consider that these species are promising lipase producers for industrial applications.",10.1590/0001-3765202120190672,"[{'lastname': 'Luz', 'firstname': 'Bárbara D DA Silva', 'initials': 'BDDS', 'affiliation': 'Programa de Pós-Graduação em Tecnologias para o Desenvolvimento Sustentável, Universidade Federal de São João Del-Rei (PPGTDS / UFSJ), Campus Alto Paraopeba, Rodovia MG 443, Km 07, 36420-000 Ouro Branco, MG, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Sarrouh', 'firstname': 'Boutros', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Federal de São João Del-Rei, Departamento de Química, Biotecnologia e Engenharia de Bioprocessos (UFSJ/ DQBIO), Campus Alto Paraopeba, Rodovia MG 443, Km 07, 36420-000 Ouro Branco, MG, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Bicas', 'firstname': 'Juliano L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Engenharia de Alimentos (FEA), Departamento de Ciência de Alimentos, Rua Monteiro Lobato, 80, Cidade Universitária ""Zeferino Vaz"" Barão Geraldo, 13083-862 Campinas, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lofrano', 'firstname': 'Renata C Z', 'initials': 'RCZ', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Federal de São João Del-Rei (UFSJ/ DEQUI), Departamento de Engenharia Química, Campus Alto Paraopeba, Rodovia MG 443, Km 07, 36420-000 Ouro Branco, MG, Brazil.'}]"

33738569,Review of Synthesiomyia nudiseta (Diptera: Muscidae) as a useful tool in forensic entomology.,International journal of legal medicine,"Synthesiomyia nudiseta (van der Wulp, 1883) is a synanthropic muscid found in tropical and subtropical zones around the world. The larvae of this species are a secondary agent of myiasis with necrophagous habits and play an important role in forensic entomology, as they are used as an indicator of post-mortem interval. Adults can be considered vectors of etiological agents such as Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae. Due to its ability to adapt to different environmental conditions, its high dispersal capacity (shown by its introduction to Europe), its predatory habits in the last larval stage and the difficulty of identifying it, a very important goal is to update our knowledge about this species. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to review the identification, geographical distribution and biology of this species in order to provide better support to investigations involving this fly.","10.1007/s00414-021-02543-w

33566277,Using next-generation sequencing to develop a Shigella species threshold and profile faecal samples from suspected diarrhoea cases.,Folia microbiologica,"Globally, it is estimated that there are 2 billion cases of diarrhoeal disease each year, with 525,000 children under the age of 5 years, dying from diarrhoea. This also affects 1 in 5 people in the UK each year. Rapid diagnosis, appropriate treatment and infection control measures are, therefore, particularly important. Currently, Public Health Wales and England Microbiology Division test for five key bacterial gastrointestinal pathogens, i.e. Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC), Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp. and Clostridioides difficile. There is, however, a poor success rate with identification of these pathogens, leaving the patient at risk from untreated infections. This study has developed effective and reliable tools with a high positive outcome for diagnosis of diarrhoeal infection. The study blindly analysed 592 samples, with the most abundant species being Shigella sonnei at 15%, and the top genus Bacteroides at 26%. Campylobacter spp. had an abundance of 4%, Clostridium difficile 3%, and Salmonella spp. 0.2%. There were also significant differences in abundance at genus level, between the Flemish Gut project and diarrhoea samples, with respect to Shigella (0.2%) and Campylobacter (0.1%). The project introduced a novel Shigella spp. (Escherichia) threshold of 5.32% to determine (Escherichia) a healthy or unhealthy community. A DMBiome model was developed to integrate the 5.32% threshold of Shigella spp., the Public Health laboratory tested pathogens, and two emerging enteropathogens. The overall positive outcome was that 89% of all samples were diagnosed with diarrhoea infections, leaving 11% unknown.","10.1007/s12223-020-00846-w

33796990,In vitro evaluation of the antibacterial effects of Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil against clinical multidrug-resistant Shigella isolates.,Molecular biology reports,"As there are little data about the antimicrobial effects of the cinnamon essential oils (EO) against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Shigella species, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activities of Cinnamomum zeylanicum EO against the clinical MDR Shigella isolates. Totally 50 MDR Shigella isolates including 17 (34%) S. flexneri, 20 (40%) S. sonnei, and 13 (26%) S. boydii were collected. The isolates were identified by standard phenotypic and molecular methods. The MDR phenotypes were determined as resistant to three antibiotic classes using disc diffusion. The C. zeylanicum EO was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cinnamon EO was evaluated by microtiter broth dilution. The most Shigella isolates 38% (n = 19) were resistant to six antibiotics. The ampicillin-amikacin-cefotaxime-erythromycin-ciprofloxacin-cotrimoxazole resistotype was the most prevalent pattern detected in five S. sonnei, four S. boydii, and three S. flexneri isolates. The result of GC/MS revealed the cinnamaldehyde (84.8%) as the main ingredient of C. zeylanycum EO. The most susceptible strain to the C. zeylanycum EO was S. boydii (MIC range = 0.15-0.62 μl/ml) followed by S. flexneri (MIC range = 0.07-1.25 μl/ml), and S. sonnei (MIC range = 0.15-1.25 μl/ml). The observed ranges of MIC and MBC values of cinnamon EO against Shigella spp. were 0.07-1.25 μl/ml and 0.31-1.25 μl/ml, respectively. The antibacterial effects of cinnamon EO in this study may increase the hope of finding suitable plant compounds to treat infections caused by MDR Shigella isolates.","10.1007/s11033-021-06309-w

33773687,Recognition of pathogens in food matrixes based on the untargeted in vivo microbial metabolite profiling via a novel SPME/GC × GC-QTOFMS approach.,"Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)","Foodborne diseases incurred by pathogenic bacteria are one of the major threats in food safety, and thus it is important to develop facile and effective recognition methodology of pathogens in food. Herein, a new automatic approach for detection of in vivo volatile metabolites emitted from foodborne pathogens was proposed by coupling solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique with a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-QTOFMS). A novel polymer composite based SPME probe which possessed high-coverage of microbial metabolites was utilized in this contribution to realize the sensitive extraction of untargeted metabolites. As a result, a total of 126 in vivo metabolites generated by the investigated pathogens were detected and identified, with 33, 29, 25, 21 and 18 volatile metabolites belonging to Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively.

33761190,"Laboratory-based surveillance of Shigella spp. from human clinical cases in Colombia, 1997-2018",Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,"Shigellosis is endemic in low-and middle-income countries, causing approximately 125 million episodes of diarrhea and leading to approximately 160 .000 deaths annually one-third of which is associated with children.
To describe the characteristics and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Shigella species recovered in Colombia from 1997 to 2018.
We received isolates from laboratories in 29 Colombian departments. We serotyped with specific antiserum and determined antimicrobial resistance and minimal inhibitory concentrations for ten antibiotics with Kirby-Bauer tests following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations.
We analyzed 5,251 isolates of Shigella spp., most of them obtained from stools (96.4%); 2,511 (47.8%) were from children under five years of age. The two most common species were S. sonnei (55.1%) and S. flexneri (41.7%). The highest resistance rate was that of tetracycline (88.1%) followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (79.3%) and ampicillin (65.5%); 50.8% of isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, 43.6% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and less than 1% to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin. In S. sonnei, the most common resistance profile corresponded to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (92%) whereas in S. flexneri the most common antibiotic profiles were multidrug resistance.
In Colombia, children under five years are affected by all Shigella species. These findings should guide funders and public health officials to make evidence based decisions for protection and prevention measures. The antimicrobial resistance characteristics found in this study underline the importance of combating the dissemination of the most frequently isolated species, S. sonnei and S. flexneri.
Introducción. La shigelosis es endémica en los países de ingresos bajos y medios y ocasiona aproximadamente 125 millones de episodios de diarrea y 160.000 muertes al año, un tercio de los cuales se presenta en niños.
Objetivo. Describir las características y los perfiles de resistencia antimicrobiana en aislamientos de Shigella spp. recuperados en Colombia entre 1997 y 2018.

The discovery of new antibiotics is of great significance to human health. In this study, the antibacterial mechanism of Sparassis crispa polysaccharides (SCPs) was explored. The SCPs isolated from Sparassis crispa was composed of fucose, glucose and galactose with a molar ratio of 0.043 : 0.652: 0.305. Bacteriostatic tests showed SCPs inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus better than Escherichia coli's, and damage to bacteria was observed under scanning electron microscopy. Metabolomic analysis based on HPLC-Q-TOF/MS indicated that SCPs disrupted metabolism of the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways in S. aureus. The variations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate, 1,3-diphosphoglycerol, succinate and oxaloacetate were significant, whose systematic changes accompanied with decrease of ATP in cells indicated that SCPs could exert antibacterial effects by inducing dysfunction of catabolism and energy metabolism.

Thus, development of novel functional coatings for infection prone surfaces with biofilm inhibiting characteristics is of prime significance considering the rapid emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria. Herein we present a novel nanocomposite derived from Graphene Oxide (GO) and a newly developed functional Ionic liquid (IL) obtained through a metathesis reaction between a triarylmethane dye hexamethyl pararosaniline chloride or crystal violet (CV) and sodium dodeceyl sulfate (SDS) to yield [CV][DS] (hexamethyl pararosaniline dodecyl sulfate). This highly biocompatible [CV][DS]-GO nanocomposite exhibit more than four times improved antibacterial activity in comparison to bare GO against both gram negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and gram positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). As suggested by XRD, FTIR and UV absorption and SEM results improved activity of [CV][DS]-GO nanocomposite is ascribed to the synergistic effect of reduced nanocomposite sheet thickness, enhanced amphiphilicity imparted by dodecylsulfate (DS), exposed active ArN",10.1016/j.colsurfb.2021.111729,"[{'lastname': 'Prusty', 'firstname': 'Susmita', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Amity Institute of Applied Sciences, Amity University Kolkata, Major Arterial Road, Action Area II, Kadampukur Village, Rajarhat, Newtown, West Bengal, 700135, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Pal', 'firstname': 'Kunal', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Life Science and Biotechnology, Jadavpur University, West Bengal, 700032, India; Division of Molecular Medicine and Centre for Translational Research, Bose Institute, Kolkata, 700056, West Bengal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Bera', 'firstname': 'Debbethi', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, West Bengal, 700032, India; Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Education, 404 B Jodhpur Park, Kolkata, West Bengal, 700068, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Paul', 'firstname': 'Anindita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Amity Institute of Applied Sciences, Amity University Kolkata, Major Arterial Road, Action Area II, Kadampukur Village, Rajarhat, Newtown, West Bengal, 700135, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mukherjee', 'firstname': 'Madhubroto', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Amity Institute of Applied Sciences, Amity University Kolkata, Major Arterial Road, Action Area II, Kadampukur Village, Rajarhat, Newtown, West Bengal, 700135, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Khan', 'firstname': 'Finaz', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Amity Institute of Applied Sciences, Amity University Kolkata, Major Arterial Road, Action Area II, Kadampukur Village, Rajarhat, Newtown, West Bengal, 700135, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Dey', 'firstname': 'Anindita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Botany, Asutosh College, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Das', 'firstname': 'Susmita', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, Amity Institute of Applied Sciences, Amity University Kolkata, Major Arterial Road, Action Area II, Kadampukur Village, Rajarhat, Newtown, West Bengal, 700135, India.

33836278,Photodynamic Therapy for Treating Staphylococcus aureus Infections.,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive spherical bacterium that causes various infections that can be superficial or become life-threatening. Besides, S. aureus represents a major producer of healthcare-associated infections. Hospital strains of S. aureus are exceptionally resistant to antibiotics, which has made their treatment difficult in recent decades. Other therapeutic alternatives have been postulated to overcome the drawbacks of multi-resistance. Of these, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising approach to address the notable shortage of new active antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. PDT combines the use of a photosensitizer agent, light, and oxygen to eradicate pathogenic microorganisms. Through a systematic analysis of published results, this work aims to verify the usefulness of applying PDT in treating multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
This review was based on a bibliographic search in various databases and the analysis of relevant publications.
There is currently a large body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of photodynamic therapy in eliminating Staphylococcus aureus strains. Both biofilm-producing strains, as well as multidrug-resistant strains.
We conclude that there is sufficient scientific evidence that PDT is a safe and useful adjunct to traditional antibiotic therapy for treating S. aureus infections.

This study aimed to explore the anti-biofilm efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) using nano-emodin (N-EMO) against multi-species bacterial biofilms containing Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii.
Following synthesis and confirmation of N-EMO as a sonosensitizer, the anti-biofilm efficacy of SDT against multi-species bacterial biofilms was determined using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC), and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of N-EMO. The reduction of multi-species bacterial biofilms was then evaluated following the treatments using Log reduction and crystal violet (CV) assays. In addition, the expression profiling of abaI, agrA, and lasI genes using SDT with sub-MIC, sub-MBIC, and sub-MBEC of N-EMO was assessed.
Successful synthesis of N-EMO was confirmed through several characterization tests. As the results demonstrated, the MIC value of N-EMO for the multi-species bacterial suspension was 0.15 × 10

Single-centre interventions, however, are likely to fail in the long term, as patients are commonly transferred between institutions given the economic integration across borders. A transnational approach targeting larger regions is needed to plan overarching sets of interventions. Here, we aim to describe differences in diagnostic and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in the fight against MDROs.
In 2019, we systematically assessed diagnostic algorithms and IPC measures implemented for detection and control of MDROs at three tertiary academic care centres (Freiburg; Strasbourg; Basel). Data were collected using a standardised data collection sheet to be filled in by every centre. Uncertainties were clarified by direct contact via telephone or email with the data supplier. Internal validity was checked by at least two researchers independently filling in the survey.
All centres have established a primarily culture-based, rather than a nucleic acid amplification-based approach for detection of MDROs (i.e., vancomycin-resistant Enterococci [VRE], methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae [ESBL], carbapenemase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negatives [CPGN/CRGN]). IPC measures differed greatly across all centres. High-risk patients are screened for most MDROs on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in all centres; only the French centre is screening all patients admitted to the ICU for VRE, MRSA and ESBL. Patients colonised/infected by MRSA, quinolone-resistant ESBL Klebsiella spp. and CPGN/CRGN are isolated everywhere, whereas patients colonised/infected by VRE and ESBL are usually not isolated in the German centre.
In contrast to the French and Swiss centres, the German centre no longer uses isolation measures to control VRE and quinolone-susceptible ESBL. Overall, the French centre is more focused on intercepting MDRO transmission from outside, whereas the German and Swiss centres are more focused on intercepting endemic MDRO transmission. These findings point to important challenges regarding future attempts to standardise IPC measures across borders. &nbsp; &nbsp.",10.4414/smw.2021.20454,"[{'lastname': 'Tschudin-Sutter', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, and Department of Clinical Research, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lavigne', 'firstname': 'Thierry', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Service d'hygiène hospitalière, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Grundmann', 'firstname': 'Hajo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Medical Centre - University of Freiburg, Institute for Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology, Freiburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rauch', 'firstname': 'Julia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Medical Centre - University of Freiburg, Institute for Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology, Freiburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Eichel', 'firstname': 'Vanessa M', 'initials': 'VM', 'affiliation': 'Heidelberg University Hospital, Centre for Infectious Diseases, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Deboscker', 'firstname': 'Stéphanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Service d'hygiène hospitalière, Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Jaulhac', 'firstname': 'Benoit', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'University of Strasbourg and CHRU Strasbourg, Laboratory of Bacteriology and UR 7290 ITI InnoVec, Fédération de Médecine Translationnelle de Strasbourg, Institute of Bacteriology, Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Mutters', 'firstname': 'Nico T', 'initials': 'NT', 'affiliation': 'Medical Centre - University of Freiburg, Institute for Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology, Freiburg, Germany / Bonn University Hospital, Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, Bonn, Germany.'}]"

33767207,Coagulase-negative staphylococci release a purine analog that inhibits Staphylococcus aureus virulence.,Nature communications,"Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus colonize similar niches in mammals and conceivably compete for space and nutrients. Here, we report that a coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus chromogenes ATCC43764, synthesizes and secretes 6-thioguanine (6-TG), a purine analog that suppresses S. aureus growth by inhibiting de novo purine biosynthesis. We identify a 6-TG biosynthetic gene cluster in S. chromogenes and other coagulase-negative staphylococci including S. epidermidis, S. pseudintermedius and S. capitis. Recombinant S. aureus strains harbouring this operon produce 6-TG and, when used in subcutaneous co-infections in mice with virulent S. aureus USA300, protect the host from necrotic lesion formation. Used prophylactically, 6-TG reduces necrotic skin lesions in mice infected with USA300, and this effect is mediated by abrogation of toxin production. RNAseq analyses reveal that 6-TG downregulates expression of genes coding for purine biosynthesis, the accessory gene regulator (agr) and ribosomal proteins in S. aureus, providing an explanation for its effect on toxin production.","10.1038/s41467-021-22175-3

33832100,Randomized clinical trial of preoperative skin preparation with 2% chlorhexidine versus conventional hair shaving in percutaneous coronary intervention.,Medicine,"Preoperative skin preparation is associated with surgical site infection (SSI). Traditional preoperative shaving fails to reduce the risk of SSI. The efficacy of 2% chlorhexidine for preoperative skin preparation in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is sketchy. The aim of this trial was to evaluate whether preoperative skin preparation performed with chlorhexidine was not inferior to a conventional hair removal method.
Seventy-eight patients undergoing PCI were randomized into 2 groups of 39 patients, receiving either single sterilization with 2% chlorhexidine or hair shaving respectively between July 2016 and October 2016. The primary endpoints were wound infection rate and bacterial counts. Secondary endpoints were rate of SSI and adverse effects of 2% chlorhexidine.
The results showed that 2% chlorhexidine significantly reduced the colonization of Staphylococcus aureus (P = .032), S epidermidis (P = .000), and miscellaneous bacteria (P = .244) in comparison with hair shaving, respectively.

We previously identified a compact SauriCas9 that displays high activity and requires a simple NNGG PAM, but the specificity is moderate. Here, we identified three compact Cas9 orthologs, Staphylococcus lugdunensis Cas9 (SlugCas9), Staphylococcus lutrae Cas9 (SlutrCas9) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus Cas9 (ShaCas9), for mammalian genome editing. Of these three Cas9 orthologs, SlugCas9 recognizes a simple NNGG PAM and displays comparable activity to SaCas9. Importantly, we generated a SlugCas9-SaCas9 chimeric nuclease, which has both high specificity and high activity. We finally engineered SlugCas9 with mutations to generate a high-fidelity variant that maintains high specificity without compromising on-target editing efficiency.

A retrospective review of the medical records of 49 eyes clinically diagnosed with infectious endophthalmitis between January 2009 and December 2018 was done. The subjects were recruited from a single tertiary referral center on Jeju Island. The baseline characteristics of all subjects were investigated, and a culture examination was performed. The isolated pathogens were analyzed to determine how their microbiological features differed from those in regions with different geographical conditions.
Of the 49 eyes, causative microorganisms were identified in 27 eyes (55.1%). Bacteria were found in 24 cases and fungi in 3 cases. Among the exogenous causes,

33789198,Diagnostic accuracy of the BJI InoPlex™ (Diaxonhit) immunoassay on blood samples for periprosthetic joint infection in complex microbiological situations. Preliminary results of 24 cases in a French Reference Center for Complex Bone and Joint Infection (CRIOAC).,"Orthopaedics & traumatology, surgery & research : OTSR","While joint aspiration is the benchmark for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infections (PJI), the results can be flawed because certain bacteria are difficult to culture, the patient is on concurrent antibiotic therapy or in some cases, repeated joint aspirations confer conflicting results. The BJI InoPlex; (Diaxonhit) is a multiplex ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) that measures the immune response (presence of specific IgG) to certain bacterial species from three families: Staphylococcus (8 antigens) epidermidis, aureus and lugdunensis, Streptococcus B (4 antigens) and Cutibacterium acnes (4 antigens). This assay is done with peripherally collected blood. However, there are few published studies about this assay, especially if the microbiological diagnosis is in doubt in cases of suspected chronic PJI. This led us to conduct a retrospective study in a French tertiary care center to determine 1) the sensitivity and specificity of the BJI InoPlex;, 2) its positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and 3) what causes diagnostic errors.
The BJI InoPlex has a sensitivity/specificity and PPV/NPV above 75%.
The BJI InoPlex was used 24 times on 24 patients between January 2016 and January 2017 in scenarios where the microbiological diagnosis was difficult: 1 with on-going antibiotic therapy, 13 conflicting repeat joint aspirations, 10 negative cultures with history of infection and/or clinical evidence of a PJI. The series consisted of 11 hip arthroplasty and 13 knee arthroplasty cases. The results of the BJI InoPlex test were compared to the MusculoSkeletal Infection Society (MSIS) the criteria for a joint infection.
For the bacterial species covered by the test, the sensitivity of the BJI InoPlex for diagnosing a chronic PJI based on the 2018 MSIS criteria was 50%, the specificity was 56%, the PPV was 36% and the NPV was 69%.
While innovative, minimally invasive, and rapid (results in a few hours), the BJI InoPlex does not provide an effective diagnosis of chronic PJI in complex microbiological situations. In this study, we used the test in the most difficult situations possible and on a small number of patients, which may explain why the results were not as good as in other studies. Its current performance and cost mean there is no role for it in our algorithm for treating patients with a suspected PJI, contrary to other biomarkers. Its spectrum must include other bacterial strains involved in chronic PJI. Knowledge of the specific infectious agent increases its diagnostic value, it could be used to monitor the outcome of a PJI, although other studies would be needed to support this use.

We previously identified a compact SauriCas9 that displays high activity and requires a simple NNGG PAM, but the specificity is moderate. Here, we identified three compact Cas9 orthologs, Staphylococcus lugdunensis Cas9 (SlugCas9), Staphylococcus lutrae Cas9 (SlutrCas9) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus Cas9 (ShaCas9), for mammalian genome editing. Of these three Cas9 orthologs, SlugCas9 recognizes a simple NNGG PAM and displays comparable activity to SaCas9. Importantly, we generated a SlugCas9-SaCas9 chimeric nuclease, which has both high specificity and high activity. We finally engineered SlugCas9 with mutations to generate a high-fidelity variant that maintains high specificity without compromising on-target editing efficiency.

Whether these fluid collections and also suture material used during the arthroscopic surgical processes show bacterial contamination over time during surgery remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine this contamination rate and to analyze its possible influence on postoperative infection.
In this study, 155 patients were included. Fifty-eight underwent reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), 63 meniscal surgery and 34 patients combined ACL reconstruction and meniscus repair. We collected pooled samples of irrigation fluid from the reservoir on the sterile drape every 15 min during the surgery. In addition, we evaluated suture material of ACL graft and meniscus repair for bacterial contamination. Samples were sent for microbiological analysis, incubation time was 14 days. All patients were seen in the outpatient department 6, 12 weeks and 12 months postoperatively and examined for clinical signs of infection.

33538555,A Retrospective Chart Review of Inflamed Epidermal Inclusion Cysts.,Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,"Epidermal inclusion cysts (EIC) are one of the most common forms of cysts found on and/or underneath the skin. Inflamed EICs typically show signs and symptoms such as pain and erythema, mimicking cutaneous abscess. However, prior studies have demonstrated at least 20% of lesions are culture negative.
To determine the rate of culture positivity in mild inflamed epidermal inclusion cysts, in particular to identify whether empiric antibiotics are warranted.
In a retrospective chart review 76 cases of inflamed EIC that were mild (lacking systemic symptoms) were analyzed who presented to the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai between 2016&ndash;2019.
Of cultures taken from inflamed cysts, 47% resulted in no bacterial growth or growth of normal flora, 38.4% resulted in growth of aerobic bacteria with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (8%), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (5%), and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (13%) predominating, and 9.3% resulting in growth of anaerobic bacteria with Finegoldia magna, Peptostreptococcus, and Cutibacterium acnes presenting. Review of prescribed treatment regimens often involved antibiotic medication, despite a high prevalence of negative culture.
Almost half of cases of mild inflamed EIC (lacking systemic symptoms) cultured will not grow pathogenic bacteria, therefore incision and drainage with culture and appropriate therapy is a viable therapeutic option in uncomplicated inflamed EIC lesions. In this way, over prescription of antibiotics can be minimized.

33822096,Immune Response and Hemolymph Microbiota of Apis mellifera and Apis cerana After the Challenge With Recombinant Varroa Toxic Protein.,Journal of economic entomology,"The honey bee is a significant crop pollinator and key model insect for understanding social behavior, disease transmission, and development. The ectoparasitic Varroa destructor mite put threats on the honey bee industry. A Varroa toxic protein (VTP) from the saliva of Varroa mites contributes to the toxicity toward Apis cerana and the deformed wing virus elevation in Apis mellifera. However, the immune response and hemolymph microbiota of honey bee species after the injection of recombinant VTP has not yet been reported. In this study, both A. cerana and A. mellifera worker larvae were injected with the recombinant VTP. Then the expressions of the honey bee immune genes abaecin, defensin, and domeless at three time points were determined by qRT-PCR, and hemolymph microbial community were analyzed by culture-dependent method, after recombinant VTP injection. The mortality rates of A. cerana larvae were much higher than those of A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. VTP injection induced the upregulation of defensin gene expression in A. mellifera larvae, and higher levels of abaecin and domeless mRNAs response in A. cerana larvae, compared with the control (without any injection). Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injection also upregulated the expression levels of abaecin, defensin, and domeless in A. mellifera and A. cerana larvae. Three bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus cohnii, and Bacillus cereus) were isolated from the hemolymph of A. cerana larvae after VTP injection and at 48 h after PBS injections. Two bacterial species (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. No bacterial colonies were detected from the larval hemolymph of both honey bee species treated by injection only and the control. The result indicates that abaecin, defensin, and domeless genes and hemolymph microbiota respond to the VTP challenge. VTP injection might induce the dramatic growth of different bacterial species in the hemolymph of the injected larvae of A. mellifera and A. cerana, which provide cues for further studying the interactions among the honey bee, VTP, and hemolymph bacteria.",10.1093/jee/toab047,"[{'lastname': 'Balakrishnan', 'firstname': 'Balachandar', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Hua', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Wenfeng', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Richou', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}]"

S. maltophilia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are often co-isolated from pneumonia patients. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that the pacIRA cluster present in some but not all clinical S. maltophilia isolates. Proteins encoded by pacIRA operon are an extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor, a transmembrane anti-sigma regulator, and a TonB-dependent receptor. This study aimed to elucidate PacIRA system function and its significance to S. maltophilia.
The pacI, pacR, and pacA genes were individually or totally deleted from the chromosome of KJΔEnt, a pacIRA-positive and siderophore-null strain. Growth promotion assay was performed to examine the implication of pacIRA system in iron utilization. Gene expression was quantified by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Growth competition assay was executed to investigate the significance of pacIRA operon to S. maltophilia.
PacIRA system contributed to utilize ferri-pyochelin of P. aeruginosa as iron sources for growth in an iron-depleted condition, but hardly utilized ferric citrate, hemin, ferri-stenobactin, and ferri-pyoverdine. PacIRA was founded to belong to Fur regulon and upregulated in response to iron-depleted stress. Growth competition assay demonstrated that pacIRA-positive S. maltophilia had a superiority over pacIRA-negative S. maltophilia in iron acquisition when they were co-cultured in P. aeruginosa ferri-pyochelin-supplemented medium.

We did a single-center retrospective analysis of 99 consecutive CF patients who underwent lung transplantation since the beginning of the Copenhagen Lung Transplant program in 1992 until October 2014. Two patients were excluded due to re-transplantation. From the time of CF diagnosis, patients had monthly sputum cultures. After transplantation, CF-patients had bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage at 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks and 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after transplantation, as well as sputum samples if relevant.

Bronchiectasis is a heterogenous disease that features among these chronic respiratory conditions in this population. However, there are sparse comparative data between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis from this region.
In this retrospective study, demographics, clinical characteristics and relevant laboratory parameters were compared among adult Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2012 and 2017.
A total of 388 adults had radiology-confirmed bronchiectasis and 258 (66%) were Aboriginal. Compared to non-Aboriginal patients, Aboriginal patients were significantly younger (mean age 54 v 67 years), the majority lived in rural and remote communities (80% v 9 %), had higher rates of self-reported smoking (52% v 19%), alcohol consumption (29% v 12%) and co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (65% v 38%) and other chronic co-morbidities. Sputum microbiology was also different between the groups with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis being more common in Aboriginal patients, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus species and non-tuberculous mycobacteria were higher in non-Aboriginal patients. Further, Aboriginal patients had poorer lung function compared to non-Aboriginal patients (forced expiratory volume after 1 second predicted 33% v 53%, forced vital capacity predicted 49% v 60% respectively), higher exacerbation rates (29% v 18%) and poorer overall outcomes (age at death 60 v 76 years).
Within a single health service, Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis have significantly poorer outcomes with differing manifestations and higher comorbidities than non-Aboriginal patients.

33836232,A case of Infective Native (Abdominal) Aortic Aneurysm caused by Streptococcus Agalactiae: An updated literature review based on new nomenclature.,Annals of vascular surgery,"The management of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has evolved significantly with the advent of endovascular strategies. Thus, there has been a decline in the number of open AAA repairs once an endovascular option is available. There have also been reports of successful endovascular management of infective native aortic aneurysms (INAA) [1], previously called mycotic aneurysms [2]. The rarity of this condition makes its management a challenging one as there are no standard guidelines. The European Society of Vascular Surgery has suggested that the nomenclature be changed from mycotic aneurysms as this can be misleading to standardise reporting [1]. The authors' present a case of a 67-year old male who presented during the peak of the Corona Virus pandemic with constitutional gastrointestinal symptoms. He was subsequently diagnosed with an INAA and successfully managed with open Neo-Aorto Iliac System reconstruction with a homograft [3]. The report highlights various strategies used in the surgical approach and their benefits in the management of INAA.

33826939,Dietary cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsion boosts growth and transcriptomes of antioxidant and immune related genes to fight Streptococcus agalactiae infection in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).,Fish & shellfish immunology,"The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary cinnamaldehyde nanoemulsion (CNE) on growth, digestive activity, antioxidant and immune responses and resistance against Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) in Nile tilapia. Four experimental diets were formulated containing CNE at levels of 0, 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg diet for 12 weeks. At the end of the experiment, all fish were challenged by S. agalactiae. The results showed that the final body weight was increased in fish groups fed 200 and 300 mg CNE/kg diet by 18.4 and 17.2 % with respect to the control group. Moreover, feed conversion ratio and digestive enzymes` activities were improved in groups fed 200 and 300 then 100 mg of dietary CNE/kg diet. Groups fed CNE exhibited a significant increase in serum immune-related parameters when compared with control group. Additionally, the hypocholesterolemic effects was achieved after CNE feeding unlike the control group in a dose dependent manner. With increasing dietary CNE levels, genes expression of cytokines and antioxidant enzymes were upregulated. Less severe adverse clinical symptoms and respectable cumulative mortalities associated with S. agalactiae infection were observed in fish fed CNE. To our knowledge, this study was the first offering a protective effect of CNE against S. agalactiae infection in Nile tilapia with a maximum down-regulation of cylE and hylB virulence genes expression noticed in group fed 300 mg of CNE/kg diet (up to 0.10 and 0.19- fold, respectively). Therefore, the present study recommended that an incorporation of CNE at level of 300 mg/kg diet for Nile tilapia could promote their growth, enhance their immunity and antioxidant status and provide protection against virulent S. agalactiae.",10.1016/j.fsi.2021.03.021,"[{'lastname': 'Abd El-Hamid', 'firstname': 'Marwa I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Ibrahim', 'firstname': 'Seham M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Clinical Nutrition, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Eldemery', 'firstname': 'Fatma', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Hygiene and Zoonoses, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, 35516, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'El-Mandrawy', 'firstname': 'Shefaa A M', 'initials': 'SAM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Metwally', 'firstname': 'Aya Sh', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Aswan University, Aswan, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Khalifa', 'firstname': 'Eman', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Matrouh University, Matrouh, 51511, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Elnahriry', 'firstname': 'Shimaa S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bacteriology, Mycology and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Sadat City, Menofia, 32897, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Ibrahim', 'firstname': 'Doaa', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Clinical Nutrition, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt.

33789637,Antimicrobial and antibiofilm potentials of cinnamon oil and silver nanoparticles against Streptococcus agalactiae isolated from bovine mastitis: new avenues for countering resistance.,BMC veterinary research,"Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae) is a contagious pathogen of bovine mastitis. It has financial implications for the dairy cattle industry in certain areas of the world. Since antimicrobial resistance increases in dairy farms, natural antimicrobials from herbal origins and nanoparticles have been given more attention as an alternative therapy. Hence, this study reported the antimicrobial and antibiofilm potentials of cinnamon oil, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and their combination against multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. agalactiae recovered from clinical bovine mastitis in Egypt.
Our findings revealed that 73% (146/200) of the examined milk samples collected from dairy cows with clinical mastitis were infected with Streptococci species. Of these, 9.59% (14/146) were identified as S. agalactiae and categorized as MDR. S. agalactiae isolates expressed four virulence genes (Hyl, cylE, scpB, and lmb) and demonstrated an ability to produce biofilms. Cinnamon oil showed high antimicrobial (MICs ≤0.063 μg /mL) and antibiofilm (MBIC
This is an in vitro preliminary approach that documented the antibiofilm potential of cinnamon oil and the inhibitory activity of cinnamon oil and its combination with AgNPs against MDR S. agalactiae recovered from clinical mastitis. Further in vivo studies should be carried out in animal models to provide evidence of concept for implementing these alternative candidates in the treatment of dairy farms infected by streptococcal mastitis in the future.",10.1186/s12917-021-02842-9,"[{'lastname': 'Abd El-Aziz', 'firstname': 'Norhan K', 'initials': 'NK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Sharkia, 44511, Egypt. norhan_vet@hotmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Ammar', 'firstname': 'Ahmed M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Sharkia, 44511, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'El-Naenaeey', 'firstname': 'El-Sayed Y M', 'initials': 'EYM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Sharkia, 44511, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'El Damaty', 'firstname': 'Hend M', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Sharkia, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Elazazy', 'firstname': 'Asmaa A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Abou Hamad Veterinary Organizations, Ministry of Agriculture, Abou Hamad, Sharkia, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Hefny', 'firstname': 'Ahmed A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Veterinary Hospital, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Sharkia, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Shaker', 'firstname': 'Asmaa', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Veterinary Hospital, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Sadat City, Sadat City, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Eldesoukey', 'firstname': 'Ibrahim E', 'initials': 'IE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bacteriology, Mycology and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kafrelsheikh University, Kafrelsheikh, Egypt.'}]"
33786585,Efficient production of glutathione with multi-pathway engineering in Corynebacterium glutamicum.,Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,"Glutathione is a bioactive tripeptide composed of glycine, l-cysteine, and l-glutamate, and has been widely used in pharmaceutical, food, and healthy products. The current metabolic studies of glutathione were mainly focused on the native producing strains with precursor amino acid supplementation. In the present work, Corynebacterium glutamicum, a workhorse for industrial production of a series of amino acids, was engineered to produce glutathione. First, the introduction of glutathione synthetase gene gshF from Streptococcus agalactiae fulfilled the ability of glutathione production in C. glutamicum and revealed that l-cysteine was the limiting factor. Then, considering the inherent capability of l-glutamate synthesis and the availability of external addition of low-cost glycine, l-cysteine biosynthesis was enhanced using a varieties of pathway engineering methods, such as disrupting the degradation pathways of l-cysteine and l-serine, and removing the repressor responsible for sulfur metabolism. Finally, the simultaneously introduction of gshF and enhancement of cysteine formation enabled C. glutamicum strain to produce glutathione greatly. Without external addition of l-cysteine and l-glutamate, 756 mg/L glutathione was produced. This is first time to demonstrate the potential of the glutathione non-producing strain C. glutamicum for glutathione production and provide a novel strategy to construct glutathione-producing strains.",10.1007/s10295-019-02220-3,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'grid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering (Education Ministry), College of Chemical and Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.\ngrid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Xiangcheng', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'grid.216417.7 0000 0001 0379 7164 Xiangya International Academy of Translational Medicine Central South University 410013 Changsha Hunan China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lian', 'firstname': 'Jiazhang', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'grid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering (Education Ministry), College of Chemical and Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.\ngrid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.\ngrid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X Center for Synthetic Biology, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'grid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering (Education Ministry), College of Chemical and Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.\ngrid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Zhinan', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'grid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X Key Laboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering (Education Ministry), College of Chemical and Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.\ngrid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X College of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Institute of Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.\ngrid.13402.34 0000 0004 1759 700X Center for Synthetic Biology, College of Chemical and Biological Engineering Zhejiang University 310027 Hangzhou China.'}]"

We report a case of hepatic infarction, abscess, and death following gastroenteritis in a 63-year-old Aboriginal man who initially presented to a rural hospital with suspected food poisoning. The patient had persistent fever and was commenced on empirical antibiotics. His blood culture results were positive for Clostridium perfringens and Enterococcus avium.

33616238,Assessing the inactivation capabilities of two commercially available platelet component pathogen inactivation systems: effectiveness at end of shelf life.,Vox sanguinis,"The inactivation capabilities of the two current commercially available pathogen inactivation (PI) systems for platelet components (PC), Mirasol and Intercept, were investigated by determination of the absence of viable bacteria at the end of shelf life by testing the entire contents of the PC by enrichment culture (terminal sterility).
A pool-and-split method was used, with two treated units and one untreated control per inoculum concentration. Pairs of PC bags were inoculated with a single bacterial species. Three concentrations (n = 2 per concentration), which incremented tenfold, were tested initially based on published data from the manufacturer. Dependent on these results, the concentrations subsequently tested were either increased or decreased until the inactivation capability of the system was derived. Bacterial count was determined post-spiking, immediately prior to treatment (2 h from spiking), immediately after treatment and at the end of shelf life (day seven). Enrichment culture was performed immediately prior to treatment, after treatment and at the end of shelf life.
The inactivation capabilities, in CFU/ml, of Intercept and Mirasol, respectively, at the end of PC shelf life were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus ≥ 10

Case report and review of the literature.,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,"The purpose of this paper is to contextualize the case of a patient with a synchronous diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and endocarditis from S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteuranus (former S. Bovis) within the current evidence, in order to determine if this condition is indicative of an underlying CRC and if it has any pathophysiologic significance.
First, we describe the clinical case. Then, we review the literature focused on the association between infections from the former S. Bovis group and CRC and on the possible role of certain microbiota species on the occurrence of CRC. At last, we discuss the implications of this case considering the current evidence.
There is a strong association between all the species of the former S. Bovis group and CRC. There is initial evidence that these bacteria may contribute to CRC by a genomic passenger mechanism.
There are two main conclusions for this paper. The first one is that CRC neoplasms and endocarditis from all species of the former S. bovis group have a strong association. Any case of infection by these subspecies should prompt to a diagnostic completion by colonoscopy. The second one is that there is an increased need for detailed reports/series and original articles based on the evaluation of gut microbiota in patients with CRC, with the aim to clarify if the association between bacteria and CRC is causative or sporadic and to better understand the possible causative mechanism of specific bacteria in initiating and promoting CRC.",10.26355/eurrev_202101_24417,"[{'lastname': 'Agnes', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical and Surgical Studies, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

However, in cell lines it remains labor intensive and time consuming to obtain desirable mutant clones due to the difficulties in isolating the mutated clones and sophisticated genotyping. In this study, we have validated fluorescent protein reporter aided cell sorting which enables the isolation of maximal diversity in mutant cells. We further applied two spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins DsRed2 and ECFP as reporters for independent CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeting, which allows for one-cell-one-well sorting of the mutant cells. Because of ultra-high efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system with dual reporters and large DNA fragment deletion resulting from independent loci cleavage, monoclonal mutant cells could be easily identified by conventional PCR. In the speed genome editing method presented here, sophisticated genotyping methods are not necessary to identify loss of function mutations after CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and desirable loss of function mutant clones could be obtained in less than one month following transfection.",10.1016/j.jbiotec.2018.06.308,"[{'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Jing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Liaoxun', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Laboratory of Mouse Genetics, Institute of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province, 453003, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gu', 'firstname': 'Yanrong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Rong', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gui', 'firstname': 'Lin', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Saichao', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qi', 'firstname': 'Xinhui', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Wenping', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chao', 'firstname': 'Tianzhu', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Mouse Genetics, Institute of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province, 453003, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Qianqian', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Yinming', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Genetic Regulators in the Immune System, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province 453003, China; Laboratory of Mouse Genetics, Institute of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan Province, 453003, China; Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, China.

29852249,Smokeless tobacco impacts oral microbiota in a Syrian Golden hamster cheek pouch carcinogenesis model.,Anaerobe,"The use of smokeless tobacco products (STPs) can cause many serious health problems. The oral microbiota plays important roles in oral and systemic health, and the disruption in the oral microbial population is linked to periodontal disease and other health problems. To assess the impact of smokeless tobacco on oral microbiota in vivo, high-throughput sequencing was used to examine the oral microbiota present in Syrian Golden hamster cheek pouches. Sixteen hamsters were divided into four groups and treated with the STP Grizzly snuff (0, 2.5, 25, or 250 mg) twice daily for 4 weeks. After 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks of treatment, bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from oral swabs sampled from the cheek pouches of the hamsters. The oral bacterial communities present in different hamster groups were characterized by sequencing the hypervariable regions V1-V2 and V4 of 16S rRNA using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Fifteen phyla, 27 classes, 59 orders, 123 families, and 250 genera were identified from 4,962,673 sequence reads from the cheek pouch samples. The bacterial diversity and taxonomic abundances for the different treatment groups were compared to the non-treated hamsters. Bacterial diversity was significantly decreased after 4 weeks of exposure to 2.5 mg, and significantly increased by exposure to 250 mg STP. Treatment with 250 mg STP significantly increased Firmicutes, transiently increased Cyanobacteria and TM7, and decreased Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria compared to the control group. At the genus level, 4 weeks of administration of 250 mg STP significantly increased Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Oribacterium, Anaerococcus, Acidaminococcus, Actinomyces, Eubacterium, Negativicoccus, and Staphylococcus, and decreased Bacteroides, Buleidia, Dialister, and Leptotrichia, and transiently decreased Arcanobacterium compared to the control group. For the first time, an animal model was used for evaluating the effects of STP on oral microbiota by metagenomic sequencing. Our results provide a view of the shift of the oral microbiota in response to STP exposure in Syrian Golden hamster. Our findings indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco significantly disrupts the oral microbiota.",10.1016/j.anaerobe.2018.05.010,"[{'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Jinshan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Microbiology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 3900 NCTR Rd, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biochemical Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 3900 NCTR Rd, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'VonTungeln', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biochemical Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 3900 NCTR Rd, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vanlandingham', 'firstname': 'Michelle', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biochemical Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 3900 NCTR Rd, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cerniglia', 'firstname': 'Carl E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': 'Division of Microbiology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 3900 NCTR Rd, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Huizhong', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Division of Microbiology, National Center for Toxicological Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 3900 NCTR Rd, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.

33835078,Influence of Proton Pump Inhibitors and Histamine Receptor 2 Antagonists on Blastocystis ST3 and Selected Microorganisms of Intestinal Microbiota In Vitro.,Clinical and translational gastroenterology,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine receptor 2 (H2) antagonists are commonly prescribed medications. Association between PPIs and alteration of the gut microbiota has been reported. Blastocystis, the most common intestinal protozoan worldwide, occurs in both healthy and symptomatic people with gastrointestinal or cutaneous disorders, with controversial pathogenicity. The current study was aimed to investigate the influence of PPIs and H2 blockers on the in vitro proliferation of selected intestinal bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.
Cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Candida albicans, and Blastocystis subtype 3 were treated with different concentrations of respective medications in vitro, and the numbers of microorganisms were quantified and compared.
Pantoprazole and esomeprazole exerted a significant inhibition on Blastocystis and C. albicans, especially at higher concentrations, which were even more effective than metronidazole. On the other hand, treatment with pantoprazole caused an increase in proliferation of L. rhamnosus and E. coli. There was no influence of H2 blockers on the examined microorganisms.
PPIs, such as pantoprazole, can be a potential treatment in the prophylaxis or eradication of Blastocystis and C. albicans.",10.14309/ctg.0000000000000325,"[{'lastname': 'Lepczyńska', 'firstname': 'Małgorzata', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dzika', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'WenChieh', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Chien-Yu', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}]"
33831063,"ddcP, pstB, and excess D-lactate impact synergism between vancomycin and chlorhexidine against Enterococcus faecium 1,231,410.",PloS one,"Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are important nosocomial pathogens that cause life-threatening infections. To control hospital-associated infections, skin antisepsis and bathing utilizing chlorhexidine is recommended for VRE patients in acute care hospitals. Previously, we reported that exposure to inhibitory chlorhexidine levels induced the expression of vancomycin resistance genes in VanA-type Enterococcus faecium. However, vancomycin susceptibility actually increased for VanA-type E. faecium in the presence of chlorhexidine. Hence, a synergistic effect of the two antimicrobials was observed. In this study, we used multiple approaches to investigate the mechanism of synergism between chlorhexidine and vancomycin in the VanA-type VRE strain E. faecium 1,231,410. We generated clean deletions of 7 of 11 pbp, transpeptidase, and carboxypeptidase genes in this strain (ponA, pbpF, pbpZ, pbpA, ddcP, ldtfm, and vanY). Deletion of ddcP, encoding a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase, altered the synergism phenotype. Furthermore, using in vitro evolution, we isolated a spontaneous synergy escaper mutant and utilized whole genome sequencing to determine that a mutation in pstB, encoding an ATPase of phosphate-specific transporters, also altered synergism. Finally, addition of excess D-lactate, but not D-alanine, enhanced synergism to reduce vancomycin MIC levels. Overall, our work identified factors that alter chlorhexidine and vancomycin synergism in a model VanA-type VRE strain.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249631,"[{'lastname': 'Bhardwaj', 'firstname': 'Pooja', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Islam', 'firstname': 'Moutusee Z', 'initials': 'MZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Christi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Uyen Thy', 'initials': 'UT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Palmer', 'firstname': 'Kelli L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, United States of America.'}]"
33822062,Emergence of aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia-positive enterococci with non-high-level gentamicin resistance mediated by IS1216V: adaptation to decreased aminoglycoside usage in Taiwan.,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,"To explore the mechanisms mediating the different levels of gentamicin resistance in enterococci.
Susceptibility testing with gentamicin and PCR of resistance determinants were performed in 149 enterococcal isolates. Genetic relatedness was characterized by MLST and PFGE analysis. Sequences of the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia gene and its surrounding environment were determined by Illumina sequencing. Stability assays of gentamicin resistance were carried out to evaluate the probability of loss of the high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) phenotype.
A total of 17 (11.4%) aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia-positive enterococcal isolates (2 Enterococcus faecalis and 15 Enterococcus faecium) with non-HLGR phenotype were found. MLST analysis revealed that the 2 E. faecalis belonged to ST116 and ST618, while all the 15 E. faecium belonged to clonal complex 17. Sequence analysis demonstrated that IS1216V was inserted into the 5'-end of aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, leading to loss of HLGR phenotype. Three IS1216V insertion types were found, and type II and III were frequently found in E. faecium. Interestingly, a total of 38 aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia-positive E. faecium with HLGR phenotype also had type II or type III IS1216V insertion. Sequencing of the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia-positive HLGR E. faecium E37 revealed that an intact aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia was located adjacent to IS1216V-disrupted aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia. In a non-antibiotic environment, E37 tended to lose HLGR phenotype with a probability of 1.57 × 10-4, which was largely attributed to homologous recombination between the intact and disrupted aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia.
This is first study to elucidate that the E. faecium is capable of changing its HLGR phenotype, which may contribute to adaptation to hospital environments with decreased usage of gentamicin.",10.1093/jac/dkab071,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'You-Han', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Shang-Yi', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Yu-Tzu', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tseng', 'firstname': 'Sung-Pin', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nDrug Development and Value Creation Research Center, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Chen-Chia', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Song-Yih', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hung', 'firstname': 'Wei-Wen', 'initials': 'WW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrine and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Jao', 'firstname': 'Ya-Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Infection Control Center, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Chun-Yu', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nInfection Control Center, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yen-Hsu', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nSchool of Medicine, Graduate Institute of Medicine, Sepsis Research Center, Center of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Biological Science and Technology, College of Biological Science and Technology, National Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan.\nInstitute of Medical Science and Technology, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hung', 'firstname': 'Wei-Chun', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}]"
33818964,Identification of Dairy Fungal Contamination and Reduction of Aflatoxin M1 Amount by Three Acid and Bile Resistant Probiotic Bacteria.,Archives of Razi Institute,"Aflatoxins (AFs) released by fungi are observed in the cow&amp;rsquo;s milk even after pasteurization. Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) has particularly an incredible clinical significance, as a critical carcinogenic agent for humans. Several strategies have been implemented for lowering the AFM1 amount, such as the employment of probiotics, particularly lactobacilli or lactic acid bacteria (LAB). However, this strategy has not been applied routinely until today. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of three LABs on the reduction of AFM1 in traditional milk and cheese samples. In total, 85 milk (n=45) and cheese (n=40) samples were obtained from the open markets of Shiraz, Iran, from February to June 2018. Additionally, the AFM1 levels were evaluated, compared to those of the National Iranian Standard. The data were then analyzed in SPSS software (version 20) through the Chi-square test. Statistical analysis was performed at a 95% confidence level (p-value of &amp;lt;0.00001). Out of 50 purchased LABs, the efficient antifungal property and resistance to bile salts were observed in five strains. The mean value of these five strains was calculated after adding 5 ppm AFM1, compared to natamycin. The strains with a reduction in AFM1 level were sequenced and registered in the NCBI database.In total, 15 samples with contamination higher than the allowed limit included Penicillium spp, Aspergillus niger, Saccharomyces cerevisia, Saccharomyces paradoxus, and Yarrowia lipolytica.The results also showed reduced AFM1 levels in three LAB-treated strains. Lactobacillus fermentum CECT562 (T), Lactobacillus brevis ATCC14869 (T), and Enterococcus faecium LMG 11423 (T) had this capability to 0.05, 0.03, and 0.03 respectively. The National Iranian Standard should be implemented to have control over traditional dairy products with more care.

33830615,"Temperature Regulation of Membrane Composition in the Firmicute, Enterococcus faecalis, Parallels That of Escherichia coli.",Environmental microbiology,"Both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli can undergo abrupt temperature transitions in nature. E. coli changes the composition of its phospholipid acyl chains in response to shifts growth temperature. This is mediated by a naturally temperature sensitive enzyme, FabF (3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase II), that elongates the 16 carbon unsaturated acyl chain palmitoleate to the 18 carbon unsaturated acyl chain, cis-vaccenate. FabF is more active at low temperatures resulting in increased incorporation of cis-vaccenoyl acyl chains into the membrane phospholipids. This response to temperature is an intrinsic property of FabF and does not require increased synthesis of the enzyme. We report that the FabF of the very divergent bacterium, E. faecalis, has properties very similar to E. coli FabF and is responsible for changing E. faecalis membrane phospholipid acyl chain composition in response to temperature. Moreover, expression E. faecalis FabF in an E. coli ∆fabF strain restores temperature regulation to the E. coli strain. This article is protected by copyright.

The potential bactericidal rates for SDF, PI and SDF + PI against E. faecalis, A. naeslundii and P. micra were calculated as reduction of bacteria colony forming units.
The bactericidal potential of SDF was at 99.97-100% against E. faecalis and 100% against A. naeslundii and P. micra. SDF + PI showed a 100% bactericidal effect against P. micra, 99.89-99.98% against E. faecalis and 99.98-100% against A. naeslundii. The bactericidal effect of PI was 99.51-99.98% against E. faecalis, 99.27-99.95% against A. naeslundii and 99.93-100% against P. micra. The differences between controls and bacteria exposed to the antibacterial agents were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
SDF had an effective bactericidal effect against the examined bacteria. However, the limitations of this in vitro study do not allow a recommendation of the employment of these solutions as root canal irrigants. Additional investigations are necessary to assess their endodontic clinical applicability.","10.1186/s12903-021-01531-1

33822096,Immune Response and Hemolymph Microbiota of Apis mellifera and Apis cerana After the Challenge With Recombinant Varroa Toxic Protein.,Journal of economic entomology,"The honey bee is a significant crop pollinator and key model insect for understanding social behavior, disease transmission, and development. The ectoparasitic Varroa destructor mite put threats on the honey bee industry. A Varroa toxic protein (VTP) from the saliva of Varroa mites contributes to the toxicity toward Apis cerana and the deformed wing virus elevation in Apis mellifera. However, the immune response and hemolymph microbiota of honey bee species after the injection of recombinant VTP has not yet been reported. In this study, both A. cerana and A. mellifera worker larvae were injected with the recombinant VTP. Then the expressions of the honey bee immune genes abaecin, defensin, and domeless at three time points were determined by qRT-PCR, and hemolymph microbial community were analyzed by culture-dependent method, after recombinant VTP injection. The mortality rates of A. cerana larvae were much higher than those of A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. VTP injection induced the upregulation of defensin gene expression in A. mellifera larvae, and higher levels of abaecin and domeless mRNAs response in A. cerana larvae, compared with the control (without any injection). Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injection also upregulated the expression levels of abaecin, defensin, and domeless in A. mellifera and A. cerana larvae. Three bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus cohnii, and Bacillus cereus) were isolated from the hemolymph of A. cerana larvae after VTP injection and at 48 h after PBS injections. Two bacterial species (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. No bacterial colonies were detected from the larval hemolymph of both honey bee species treated by injection only and the control. The result indicates that abaecin, defensin, and domeless genes and hemolymph microbiota respond to the VTP challenge.

16696682,Comparison of culture media and chairside assays for enumerating mutans streptococci.,Journal of applied microbiology,"This study compared several traditional culture-based media and chairside cultural assays for ability to recover mutans streptococci (MS) from pure cultures and from saliva samples.
When pure cultures were used with traditional culture-based media, mitis-salivarius bacitracin (MSB) agar demonstrated less support for bacterial recovery than trypticase-yeast extract-cysteine sucrose-bacitracin (TYCSB) agar and the modified medium of Ritz (HLR-S). One species of MS, Streptococcus ferus (c), was not recovered on MSB medium. Chairside cultural tests displayed considerable disparity between tests in recovering bacteria from pure cultures. On the glass adherence assay (Mucount), S. ferus was not detected and Streptococcus criceti was not detected on the dipslide assay (Cariescreen SM) or on the plastic adherence assay (Dentocult SM Strip mutans). The frequency of isolation of pure strains of bacteria other than MS was common. From saliva samples, the frequency of isolation of MS on HLR-S and TYCSB media and the glass adherence assay was 91-97%. The frequency of isolation on MSB medium and on the dip-slide and plastic adherence assays was significantly decreased (37, 47 and 69%, respectively). Recovery scores varied considerably among the culture methods studied and tended to be highest on the HLR-S medium and on the glass adherence assay.
Growth and recovery profiles of pure bacterial cultures and of saliva samples for the MS varied according to different media.
Caution should be exercised in comparing results between studies that employ different cultural methods for MS enumeration.",10.1111/j.1365-2672.2006.02877.x,"[{'lastname': 'Hildebrandt', 'firstname': 'G H', 'initials': 'GH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Restorative Sciences, The University of Minnesota School of Dentistry, Minneapolis, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bretz', 'firstname': 'W A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': None}]"

SDS PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins and comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated the four strains were highly related to each other but that they did not correspond to any recognised species of the genus Streptococcus. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed the unidentified organisms form a hitherto unknown sub-line within the Streptococcus genus, displaying a close affinity with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus ferus and related organisms. Sequence divergence values of > 5% with these and other reference streptococcal species however demonstrated the organisms from equine sources represent a novel species. Based on the phenotypic distinctiveness of the new bacterium and molecular chemical and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown species be classified as Streptococcus devriesei sp. nov.

33823920,Stimulation of regulatory T cells with Lactococcus lactis expressing enterotoxigenic E. coli colonization factor antigen 1 retains salivary flow in a genetic model of Sjögren's syndrome.,Arthritis research & therapy,"Sjögren's syndrome (SjS), one of the most common autoimmune diseases, impacts millions of people annually. SjS results from autoimmune attack on exocrine (salivary and lacrimal) glands, and women are nine times more likely to be affected than men. To date, no vaccine or therapeutic exists to treat SjS, and patients must rely on lifelong therapies to alleviate symptoms.
Oral treatment with the adhesin from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) fimbriae protects against several autoimmune diseases in an antigen (Ag)-independent manner. Lactococcus lactis, which was recently adapted to express CFA/I fimbriae (LL-CFA/I), effectively suppresses inflammation by the induction of infectious tolerance via Ag-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs), that produce IL-10 and TGF-β. To test the hypothesis that CFA/I fimbriae can offset the development of inflammatory T cells via Treg induction, oral treatments with LL-CFA/I were performed on the spontaneous, genetically defined model for SjS, C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice to maintain salivary flow.
Six-week (wk)-old C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice were orally dosed with LL-CFA/I and treated every 3 wks; control groups were given L. lactis vector or PBS. LL-CFA/I-treated mice retained salivary flow up to 28 wks of age and showed significantly reduced incidence of inflammatory infiltration into the submandibular and lacrimal glands relative to PBS-treated mice. A significant increase in Foxp3
These data demonstrate that oral LL-CFA/I reduce or halts SjS progression, and these studies will provide the basis for future testing in SjS patients.","10.1186/s13075-021-02475-1

33821549,Proteome constraints reveal targets for improving microbial fitness in nutrient-rich environments.,Molecular systems biology,"Cells adapt to different conditions via gene expression that tunes metabolism for maximal fitness. Constraints on cellular proteome may limit such expression strategies and introduce trade-offs. Resource allocation under proteome constraints has explained regulatory strategies in bacteria. It is unclear, however, to what extent these constraints can predict evolutionary changes, especially for microorganisms that evolved under nutrient-rich conditions, i.e., multiple available nitrogen sources, such as Lactococcus lactis. Here, we present a proteome-constrained genome-scale metabolic model of L. lactis (pcLactis) to interpret growth on multiple nutrients. Through integration of proteomics and flux data, in glucose-limited chemostats, the model predicted glucose and arginine uptake as dominant constraints at low growth rates. Indeed, glucose and arginine catabolism were found upregulated in evolved mutants. At high growth rates, pcLactis correctly predicted the observed shutdown of arginine catabolism because limited proteome availability favored lactate for ATP production. Thus, our model-based analysis is able to identify and explain the proteome constraints that limit growth rate in nutrient-rich environments and thus form targets of fitness improvement.",10.15252/msb.202010093,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nNovo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'van Pelt-KleinJan', 'firstname': 'Eunice', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Olst', 'firstname': 'Berdien', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nHost-Microbe Interactomics, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands.\nLaboratory of Biochemistry, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Douwenga', 'firstname': 'Sieze', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Boeren', 'firstname': 'Sjef', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nLaboratory of Biochemistry, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Bachmann', 'firstname': 'Herwig', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\nNIZO Food Research, Ede, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Molenaar', 'firstname': 'Douwe', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Nielsen', 'firstname': 'Jens', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nNovo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.\nNovo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark.\nBioInnovation Institute, Copenhagen N, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Teusink', 'firstname': 'Bas', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'TiFN, Wageningen, the Netherlands.\nSystems Biology Lab, Amsterdam Institute of Molecular and Life Sciences (AIMMS), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}]"
33818712,Heat-Killed Lactic Acid Bacteria Inhibit Nitric Oxide Production via Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase and Cyclooxygenase-2 in RAW 264.7 Cells.,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,"Heat-killed lactic acid bacteria perform immunomodulatory functions and are advantageous as probiotics, considering their long product shelf-life, easy storage, and convenient transportation. In this study, we aimed to develop appropriate heat treatments for industrial preparation of probiotics with antioxidant activity. Among 75 heat-killed strains, Lactococcus lactis MG5125 revealed the highest nitric oxide inhibition (86.2%), followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus MG4559 (86.0%), Lactobacillus plantarum MG5270 (85.7%), Lactobacillus fermentum MG4510 (85.3%), L. plantarum MG5239 (83.9%), L. plantarum MG5289 (83.2%), and L. plantarum MG5203 (81.8%). Moreover, the heat-killed selected strains markedly inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression. The use of heat-killed bacteria with intact bio-functionality can elongate the shelf-life and simplify the food processing steps of probiotic foods, given their high stability. The antioxidant and immune-modulatory activities of the heat-killed strains selected in this study indicate a strong potential for their utilization probiotic products manufacturing.","10.1007/s12602-021-09781-9

The present study investigated the role of macrophages in stimulating tissue coverage overgrowth of contaminating oral bacteria on polished titanium (Ti-P) and acid-etched zirconium dioxide (ZrO2-MA) dental implant materials. Different co-culture models were employed to determine phagocytosis rates of Streptococcus mitis or Staphylococcus aureus contaminating a dental implant surface and the influence of contaminating bacteria and osteoblasts (U2OS) on macrophage polarisation. S. aureus was phagocytized in higher numbers than S. mitis in bi-cultures on smooth Ti-P surfaces. Contaminating S. mitis stimulated near full polarisation of macrophages from a non-Ym1-expressing- to a Ym1-expressing-phenotype on smooth Ti-P, but on ZrO2-MA both phenotypes occurred. In tri-cultures with U2OS-cells on smooth Ti-P, a larger percentage of macrophages remained in their non-Ym1-expressing, ""fighting"" M1-like phenotype to clear Ti-P surfaces from contaminating bacteria. On ZrO2-MA surfaces, more macrophages tended towards their ""fix- and-repair"" M2-like phenotype than on Ti-P surfaces. Surface coverage of smooth, bacterially contaminated Ti-P surfaces by U2OS-cells was more effectively stimulated by fighting, M1-like macrophages than on ZrO2-MA surfaces.

33827534,Analysis of oral microbial dysbiosis associated with early childhood caries.,BMC oral health,"""Core microbes"" play a key role in the development of caries and lead to microbial disorders. Our goal was to detect the core microbes associated with the microbiota imbalance in early childhood caries (ECC).
Fifteen caries-free children and fifteen high-caries (DMFT ≥ 10) children aged 4-6 years old were recruited according to the diagnostic criteria of caries suggested by the WHO. The 16S rRNA genes from samples of plaque in saliva were amplified by PCR, and the PCR products were sequenced by the Illumina Miseq platform. The sequencing results were analyzed by professional software to determine the composition and structure of the saliva microorganisms.
There were statistically significant differences between the groups regarding the relative abundance of Streptococcus mutans (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding other species or functional genes.
S. mutans, together with other pathogens, may play a prominent role and act as ""core microbes"" in the occurrence and development of early childhood caries.","10.1186/s12903-021-01543-x

33825326,Streptococcus mutans in atherosclerotic plaque: molecular and immunohistochemical evaluations.,Oral diseases,"To verify the presence of Streptococcus mutans (SM) in atherosclerotic plaque (AP) using techniques with different sensitivities, correlating with histological changes in plaque and immunoexpression of inflammatory markers.
Thirteen AP samples were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), histopathological analyses, histochemical analysis by Giemsa staining (GS), and immunohistochemical analysis for SM, IL-1β, and TNF-α (streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method). Ten necropsy samples of healthy vessels were used as controls.
All AP samples showed histopathological characteristics of severe atherosclerosis and were positive for SM (100.0%) in qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses. GS showed that Streptococcus sp. colonized the lipid-rich core regions and fibrous tissue, while the control group was negative for Streptococcus sp. IL-1β and TNF-α were expressed in 100% and 92.3% of the AP tested, respectively. The control samples were positive for SM in qRT-PCR analysis, but negative for SM, IL-1β, and TNF-α in immunohistochemical analyses.
The detection of SM in AP and the visualization of Streptococcus sp. suggested a possible association between SM and atherosclerosis. The results obtained from the control samples suggested the presence of DNA fragments or innocuous bacteria that were not associated with tissue alteration.

31182038,In vitro activities of Eravacycline against 336 isolates collected from 2012 to 2016 from 11 teaching hospitals in China.,BMC infectious diseases,"In China multidrug-resistant bacteria pose a considerable threat to public health. Antimicrobial resistance has weakened the effectiveness of many medicines widely used today. Thus, discovering new antibacterial drugs is paramount in the effort to treat emerging drug-resistant bacteria.
Eravacycline, tigecycline and other clinical routine antibiotics were tested by reference broth micro-dilution method against 336 different strains collected from 11 teaching hospitals in China between 2012 and 2016. These isolates included Enterobacteriaceae, non-fermentative, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus, and a number of fastidious organisms. The strains involved in this study possess the most important drug resistance characteristics currently known in China. Drug resistant bacteria such as those producing extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases (KPC-2 and NDM-1), and those exhibiting colistin resistance (mcr-1) and tigecycline were included in this study. Additionally, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), β-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae, and penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) were also included.
Eravacycline exhibited good efficacy against all the strains tested, especially for organisms with ESBLs, carbapenemases, and mcr-1 gene compared with tigecycline and other antibiotics tested. The MIC values of eravacycline against carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae and OXA-23-producing A. baumannii were much lower than the MIC values of other antibiotics. MRSA, VRE, β-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenza, and PRSP were sensitive to eravacycline in every strain tested.

32409068,Incorporation of lysozyme into a mucoadhesive electrospun patch for rapid protein delivery to the oral mucosa.,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications","The delivery of biopharmaceuticals to the oral mucosa offers a range of potential applications including antimicrobial peptides to treat resistant infections, growth factors for tissue regeneration, or as an alternative to injections for systemic delivery. Existing formulations targeting this site are typically non-specific and provide little control over dose. To address this, an electrospun dual-layer mucoadhesive patch was investigated for protein delivery to the oral mucosa. Lysozyme was used as a model antimicrobial protein and incorporated into poly(vinylpyrrolidone)/Eudragit RS100 polymer nanofibers using electrospinning from an ethanol/water mixture. The resulting fibrous membranes released the protein at a clinically desirable rate, reaching 90 ± 13% cumulative release after 2 h. Dual fluorescent fibre labelling and confocal microscopy demonstrated the homogeneity of lysozyme and polymer distribution. High encapsulation efficiency and preservation of enzyme activity were achieved (93.4 ± 7.0% and 96.1 ± 3.3% respectively). The released lysozyme inhibited the growth of the oral bacterium Streptococcus ratti, providing further evidence of retention of biological activity and illustrating a potential application for treating and preventing oral infections. An additional protective poly(caprolactone) backing layer was introduced to promote unidirectional delivery, without loss of enzyme activity, and the resulting dual-layer patches displayed long residence times using an in vitro test, showing that the adhesive properties were maintained. This study demonstrates that the drug delivery system has great potential for the delivery of therapeutic proteins to the oral mucosa.",10.1016/j.msec.2020.110917,"[{'lastname': 'Edmans', 'firstname': 'Jake G', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': 'School of Clinical Dentistry, 19 Claremont Crescent, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TA, UK; Department of Chemistry, Brook Hill, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S3 7HF, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Murdoch', 'firstname': 'Craig', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Clinical Dentistry, 19 Claremont Crescent, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TA, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Santocildes-Romero', 'firstname': 'Martin E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'AFYX Therapeutics, Lergravsej 57, 2. tv, 2300 Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Hatton', 'firstname': 'Paul V', 'initials': 'PV', 'affiliation': 'School of Clinical Dentistry, 19 Claremont Crescent, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TA, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Colley', 'firstname': 'Helen E', 'initials': 'HE', 'affiliation': 'School of Clinical Dentistry, 19 Claremont Crescent, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TA, UK.

Forty-eight periodontitis patients were included in this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. After root planing, patients used either a placebo or a probiotic tablet twice a day for 12 weeks. The pocket probing depth (primary outcome measure), bleeding on probing and relative attachment levels were measured at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. At baseline, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks, microbiological sampling was performed and plaque and gingival indices were recorded.
The primary and secondary outcome measures were significantly (p < 0.05) improved at the 12- and the 24-week evaluation in both groups. However, no significant inter-group differences could be detected at any time point, except from the % of sites with plaque that were significantly lower in the probiotic group than in the control group at the 24-week evaluation. In addition, at the 12-week time point, the salivary Prevotella intermedia counts were significantly lower in the probiotic group.

Sixty subjects 6 to 12 years old with a caries risk assessment (CAMBRA) of moderate to high (caries prone) were evaluated by an analysis of the difference in the salivary levels of pathogenic bacteria (mutans streptococci and Lactobacilli). The subjects were randomly selected by randomizing software and assigned to two diferent Groups. Group A used PerioBalance (Lactobacilli reuteri-CFU of 200 million) lozenges for 28 days. Group B used the EvoraKids (Streptococcus uberis KJ2, Streptococcus oralis KJ3, Streptococcus rattus JH1 45, > or = 100 million) probiotics chewable tablets for 30 days. Salivary samples were collected then incubated for 48 hours for colony counting and ranking. Follow up testing with the CRT was performed after 60 days at a follow up visit.
There was a statistically significant diference in the CRT results between the pre and post use of the probiotics. PerioBalance; SM results t= -6. 78, p< .0001, Lactobacilli results t= -5.762, p< .0001, EvoraKids SMresults t= -7.33, p< .0001, Lactobacilli results t= -2.952, p= .0068.
The CRT values obtained with caries prone children may be significantly affected by probiotic use.

To evaluate a combination of hydroxyapatite and lysozyme, lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase for the treatment of dentinal caries by measuring viable Streptococcus mutans.
Laboratory study with experimental groups.
Carious lesions in 20 permanent third molars were treated with a combination of hydroxyapatite and the enzymes lysozyme, lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase. Carious dentin was collected and homogenized in a vortex shaker. After homogenization, five decimal dilutions were performed. Three aliquots of 25 μL of each dilution were seeded onto the surface of mitis salivarius bacitracin (MSB) medium. All plates were incubated in anaerobic jars. After incubation, the viable bacterial count was determined. S. mutans counts were obtained before and 24 h, 1 month, and 6 months after treatment.
Descriptive statistical analysis and the Kruskal-Wallis test, supplemented by the Student-Newman-Keuls test.
A significant reduction in S. mutans counts was observed 24 h after sealing with a combination of hydroxyapatite, lysozyme, lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase as compared to counts after 1 month and after 6 months (P < 0.05).

33718431,Prevention and Control of Pathogens Based on Big-Data Mining and Visualization Analysis.,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,"Morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases rank first among all human illnesses. Many pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear, while misuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Infectious diseases spread rapidly and pathogens mutate quickly, posing new threats to human health. However, with the increasing use of high-throughput screening of pathogen genomes, research based on big data mining and visualization analysis has gradually become a hot topic for studies of infectious disease prevention and control. In this paper, the framework was performed on four infectious pathogens (Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Neisseria, and Streptococcus salivarius) through five functions: 1) genome annotation, 2) phylogeny analysis based on core genome, 3) analysis of structure differences between genomes, 4) prediction of virulence genes/factors with their pathogenic mechanisms, and 5) prediction of resistance genes/factors with their signaling pathways. The experiments were carried out from three angles: phylogeny (macro perspective), structure differences of genomes (micro perspective), and virulence and drug-resistance characteristics (prediction perspective). Therefore, the framework can not only provide evidence to support the rapid identification of new or unknown pathogens and thus plays a role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, but also help to recommend the most appropriate strains for clinical and scientific research. This paper presented a new genome information visualization analysis process framework based on big data mining technology with the accommodation of the depth and breadth of pathogens in molecular level research.",10.3389/fmolb.2020.626595,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Cui-Xia', 'initials': 'CX', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Li-Na', 'initials': 'LN', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hou', 'firstname': 'Xue-Xin', 'initials': 'XX', 'affiliation': 'National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'Peng-Cheng', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': 'Bejing Ditan Hospital, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Long', 'initials': 'XL', 'affiliation': 'Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'Xiao-Chen', 'initials': 'XC', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Yu-Fei', 'initials': 'YF', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Rui-Kun', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Tian-Jun', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Min-Na', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Yue', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Chao', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Qian', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Chuan', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Hua-Fang', 'initials': 'HF', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Xu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Center for Informational Biology, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Zong-Fu', 'initials': 'ZF', 'affiliation': 'National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.\nNational Center of Human Genetic Resources, Beijing, China.'}]"

33734346,Regulatory T cell/Th17 balance in the pathogenesis of pediatric Behçet disease.,"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)","Behçet disease (BD) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology. The aim of this study was to determine the orientation of T cell subpopulations in pediatric BD and more precisely to look for a regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs)/Th17 imbalance.
T cell subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of pediatric patients with acute (aBD, n = 24), remitting (rBD, n = 12) BD, and in healthy controls (HC, n = 24). Tregs (CD4+CD25hiCD127-/loFoxp3+), activated Tregs (GITR, LAP, CTLA-4, and HLA-DR expression), CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing interferon-g (Th1 and Tc1) or interleukin (IL)-17 (Th17 and Tc17) under polyclonal (OKT3/IL-2) or antigenic (Streptococcus sanguis KTH-1 peptides and HSP-60) stimulation, were numerated.
Th17 (1.9 and 5.1 fold) and Tc17 (4.0 and 2.0 fold) frequency under mitogenic stimulation was significantly increased in aBD and rBD patients as compared with HC. Th17 frequency under antigenic stimulation was also higher in patients than in HC. The percentage and number of Tregs and activated Tregs in patients and in HC were similar. However, when Tregs were removed, antigen-driven differentiation into Th1 and Th17 was significantly boosted in BD but not in HC CD4+T cells.
There is a bias toward a Th17 polarization in acute and remitting BD children. Although we did not observe an increase in the number of Tregs in these patients, their Tregs limit CD4+T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells. Thus, in pediatric BD, Tregs seem to incompletely counterbalance a Th17 orientation of the helper T cell response.",10.1093/rheumatology/keab253,"[{'lastname': 'Filleron', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'INSERM U 1183, Université Montpellier-Nîmes, France.\nService de pédiatrie, Centre hospitalier universitaire de Nîmes, Université Montpellier-Nîmes, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Tran', 'firstname': 'Tu Anh', 'initials': 'TA', 'affiliation': 'INSERM U 1183, Université Montpellier-Nîmes, France.\nService de pédiatrie, Centre hospitalier universitaire de Nîmes, Université Montpellier-Nîmes, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Hubert', 'firstname': 'Audrey', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Département de Biothérapies (CIC-BTi) et Inflammation-Immunopathologie-Biothérapie (I2B), AP-HP, Hôpital La Pitié-Salpêtrière, Paris, F-75651, France.\nSorbonne Université, INSERM, UMR_S 959, Immunologie-Immunopathologie- Immunothérapie (I3); F-75561, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Letierce', 'firstname': 'Alexia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Unité de Recherche Clinique Paris Sud.

33478576,Whole microbial community viability is not quantitatively reflected by propidium monoazide sequencing approach.,Microbiome,"High-throughput sequencing provides a powerful window into the structural and functional profiling of microbial communities, but it is unable to characterize only the viable portion of microbial communities at scale. There is as yet not one best solution to this problem. Previous studies have established viability assessments using propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment coupled with downstream molecular profiling (e.g., qPCR or sequencing). While these studies have met with moderate success, most of them focused on the resulting ""viable"" communities without systematic evaluations of the technique. Here, we present our work to rigorously benchmark ""PMA-seq"" (PMA treatment followed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) for viability assessment in synthetic and realistic microbial communities.
PMA-seq was able to successfully reconstruct simple synthetic communities comprising viable/heat-killed Escherichia coli and Streptococcus sanguinis. However, in realistically complex communities (computer screens, computer mice, soil, and human saliva) with E. coli spike-in controls, PMA-seq did not accurately quantify viability (even relative to variability in amplicon sequencing), with its performance largely affected by community properties such as initial biomass, sample types, and compositional diversity. We then applied this technique to environmental swabs from the Boston subway system. Several taxa differed significantly after PMA treatment, while not all microorganisms responded consistently. To elucidate the ""PMA-responsive"" microbes, we compared our results with previous PMA-based studies and found that PMA responsiveness varied widely when microbes were sourced from different ecosystems but were reproducible within similar environments across studies.
This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of PMA-seq exploring its quantitative potential in synthetic and complex microbial communities, where the technique was effective for semi-quantitative purposes in simple synthetic communities but provided only qualitative assessments in realistically complex community samples.

A 5% dilution of L. fermentum OK culture supernatant showed that 60% inhibition against the growth of S. mutans and L. fermentum OK displayed significant inhibitory effects against the growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus sanguinis. However, proliferation of L. fermentum OK, when co-cultured with harmful oral bacteria, was retarded. L. fermentum OK was shown to produce 1130 μmol/L hydrogen peroxide, aggregate efficiently with Streptococcus sobrinus, S. gordonii, S. mutans, S. sanguinis, and P. gingivalis, and reduce S. mutans that produced artificial dental plaque by 97.9%. The in vitro cell adhesion capacity of L. fermentum OK to an oral epithelial cell line was 3.1 cells per cell and the cell adhesion of F. nucleatum and S. mutans decreased strongly in protection and displacement assays. L. fermentum OK was evaluated for safety using ammonia production, biogenic amine production, hemolytic property, mucin degradation testing, antibiotic susceptibility, and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Based on this study, L. fermentum OK appears to be a safe and bioactive lactobacterial food ingredient, starter culture, and/or probiotic microorganism for human oral health.","10.1007/s12602-021-09761-z

33826149,Variations in IgG antibody subclass responses to oral bacteria: Effects of periodontal disease and modifying factors.,Journal of periodontal research,"Local and systemic IgG antibodies or oral bacteria have been described with periodontitis. We extended these observations by assessing the impact of a range of intrinsic factors on serum IgG subclass antibodies to both commensal and pathogenic oral bacteria that would contribute to variations in immune protection or disease susceptibility in periodontitis have not been described.
Subjects (n = 278) were classified as healthy, gingivitis, or periodontitis and categorized as mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis. Demographic stratification included sex, age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and obesity. Whole formalin-fixed bacteria were used as antigens to detect serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass antibody levels using an ELISA.
The greatest differences in variations in IgG subclasses occurred in periodontitis versus health or gingivitis to bacteria considered oral pathogens (eg, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola) with IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 increased by three- to sevenfold with Pg. Differences in subclass levels and distribution were also observed related to disease severity, particularly related to individual subclass responses to Pg. Examination of the overall population showed that females had elevated antibody, reflected by elevated IgG2 amounts/proportions. The older group of subjects demonstrated elevated antibody to multiple oral bacteria, lacking any particular subclass pattern. IgG2 antibody to Aa and Pg was increased in smokers. Multiple IgG subclass antibody levels to oral pathogens were significantly decreased in the obese subset within this population.
This investigation identified patterns of IgG subclass antibody responses to oral bacteria and demonstrated substantial effects of disease impacting the level and subclass distribution of antibody to an array of oral bacteria. Altered subclass antibody profiles most often in IgG2 levels and for antibody to P. gingivalis were found related to sex, age, disease severity, race/ethnicity, smoking, and obesity to both pathogens and commensal bacteria.",10.1111/jre.12882,"[{'lastname': 'Ebersole', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Science, School of Dental Medicine, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.\nCenter for Oral Health Research, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamzeh', 'firstname': 'Razan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Oral Health Research, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.\nDivision of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Linh', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Science, School of Dental Medicine, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Sabbagh', 'firstname': 'Mohanad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dawson', 'firstname': 'Dolph', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Center for Oral Health Research, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.\nDivision of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}]"

33817178,"A Case of Syphilis with High Bone Arsenic Concentration from Early Modern Cemetery (Wroclaw, Poland).",Open life sciences,"Venereal syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by Treponema pallidum - Gram-negative, slowly growing bacteria. The spread of the disease in the Old World was due to increased birth rate, urban population growth, migration and lack of knowledge concerning the epidemiology. In the past, the treatment was mainly symptomatic and included application of mercury compounds. The goal of the study was to present the case of advanced venereal syphilis found in early modern (16th-18thc) graveyard localized in Wroclaw, Poland. The object of the study is a cranium of a male whose age at death has been estimated to be over 55. In order to observe the morphological and paleopathological characteristics of the examined material, anthropometrics, computed tomography, spectrometry and microscopic methods were incorporated. Microscopic analysis revealed the presence of the extensive inflammatory lesions. Analyses indicate tertiary stage of venereal syphilis as the most probable cause of the observed lesions. Concentration of arsenic (16.17±0.58 μg/g) in examined bone samples was about hundred times bigger than average arsenic concentration in bones reported in other studies.

However, recent reports have described MS in immunocompetent individuals. To describe the characteristics of individuals with MS and associated risk factors, a review of case reports published from 2014 to 2018 was conducted. Out of 45 published case reports, 33 cases (73%) occurred in HIV-positive individuals with majority having CD4 counts <500 cells/mm3. Of the 12 cases (27%) in HIV-negative individuals, half had comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, drug abuse, psoriasis, and hepatitis. The most frequent manifestation of MS was ulceronodular cutaneous lesions with central adherent crust, which affected the face, trunk, and limbs. Given the increasing number of MS regardless of the immune status, dermatologists and general practitioners should be vigilant to allow early diagnosis and treatment, hence reducing their morbidity.",10.1016/j.ad.2021.02.011,"[{'lastname': 'Wibisono', 'firstname': 'O', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Dermatología y Venereología, Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Hasanuddin, 90245, Makassar, Indonesia; Hospital Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo, 90245, Makassar, Indonesia.

33793630,"A qualitative assessment of structural barriers to prenatal care and congenital syphilis prevention in Kern County, California.",PloS one,"Congenital syphilis is the result of placental transmission from mother to fetus of Treponema pallidum. Although congenital syphilis is preventable through timely treatment, the rate of new infections in the United States (US) has increased each year since 2013, and is increasing at a noticeably greater pace in California (CA). Most research into congenital syphilis has focused on individual psychosocial and behavioral factors that contribute to maternal vulnerability for syphilis. The aim of this study was to evaluate structural barriers to prenatal care access and utilization and congenital syphilis prevention in Kern County, CA. Transcripts from 8 in-depth interviews with prenatal care providers and 5 focus group discussions with 42 pregnant and postpartum persons were examined using thematic analysis. Structural barriers experienced by pregnant and postpartum persons to prenatal care access and utilization included (1) burdens of poverty; (2) stigma around substance use in pregnancy; (3) citizenship status; (4) lack of healthcare coverage; (5) low sexual health literacy; and (6) gender inequality Structural barriers experienced by prenatal care providers in congenital syphilis prevention included (1) limited guidance on clinical management of syphilis in pregnancy; (2) decay in public health infrastructure; and (3) inadequate support for managing patients' social comorbidities. The response to congenital syphilis prevention will require an examination of the complex context of social determinants of health in which persons diagnosed with syphilis live in.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249419,"[{'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Elaine Y L', 'initials': 'EYL', 'affiliation': 'David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Smullin', 'firstname': 'Carolyn', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Clavijo', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.\nDepartment of Community Health Sciences, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.\nCharles R Drew University of Medicine and Science, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Papp-Green', 'firstname': 'Melissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Eunhee', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Health Sciences, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Nelson', 'firstname': 'Marlene', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Social Sciences and Education, California State University-Bakersfield, Bakersfield, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Giarratano', 'firstname': 'Gloria', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Wagman', 'firstname': 'Jennifer A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Health Sciences, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}]"

33826149,Variations in IgG antibody subclass responses to oral bacteria: Effects of periodontal disease and modifying factors.,Journal of periodontal research,"Local and systemic IgG antibodies or oral bacteria have been described with periodontitis. We extended these observations by assessing the impact of a range of intrinsic factors on serum IgG subclass antibodies to both commensal and pathogenic oral bacteria that would contribute to variations in immune protection or disease susceptibility in periodontitis have not been described.
Subjects (n = 278) were classified as healthy, gingivitis, or periodontitis and categorized as mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis. Demographic stratification included sex, age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and obesity. Whole formalin-fixed bacteria were used as antigens to detect serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass antibody levels using an ELISA.
The greatest differences in variations in IgG subclasses occurred in periodontitis versus health or gingivitis to bacteria considered oral pathogens (eg, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola) with IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 increased by three- to sevenfold with Pg. Differences in subclass levels and distribution were also observed related to disease severity, particularly related to individual subclass responses to Pg. Examination of the overall population showed that females had elevated antibody, reflected by elevated IgG2 amounts/proportions. The older group of subjects demonstrated elevated antibody to multiple oral bacteria, lacking any particular subclass pattern. IgG2 antibody to Aa and Pg was increased in smokers. Multiple IgG subclass antibody levels to oral pathogens were significantly decreased in the obese subset within this population.
This investigation identified patterns of IgG subclass antibody responses to oral bacteria and demonstrated substantial effects of disease impacting the level and subclass distribution of antibody to an array of oral bacteria. Altered subclass antibody profiles most often in IgG2 levels and for antibody to P. gingivalis were found related to sex, age, disease severity, race/ethnicity, smoking, and obesity to both pathogens and commensal bacteria.",10.1111/jre.12882,"[{'lastname': 'Ebersole', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Science, School of Dental Medicine, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.\nCenter for Oral Health Research, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamzeh', 'firstname': 'Razan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Oral Health Research, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.\nDivision of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Linh', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Science, School of Dental Medicine, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Sabbagh', 'firstname': 'Mohanad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dawson', 'firstname': 'Dolph', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Center for Oral Health Research, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.\nDivision of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}]"

Bacterial counts were enumerated by plate counting. Hemolysin production was evaluated by blood agar and hemolytic titer tests. The two V.   alginolyticus  strains displayed similar growth and hemolysin production patterns in the foods. Based on the goodness of fit primary model statistics (R 2 , MSE, BF, AF), the modified Gompertz model was a better fit to V.   alginolyticus  growth in foods than the logistic model. Growth kinetic parameters of V.   alginolyticus  displayed a higher μ max and shorter λ in briny tilapia > shrimp > freshwater fish > egg fried rice > scallop > oyster > chicken > pork.

33836064,Crystal structure and functional implication of a bacterial cyclic AMP-AMP-GMP synthetase.,Nucleic acids research,"Mammalian cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its homologue dinucleotide cyclase in Vibrio cholerae (VcDncV) produce cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) that participate in the defense against viral infection. Recently, scores of new cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases (CD-NTases) were discovered, which produce various CDNs and cyclic trinucleotides (CTNs) as second messengers. Here, we present the crystal structures of EcCdnD, a CD-NTase from Enterobacter cloacae that produces cyclic AMP-AMP-GMP, in its apo-form and in complex with ATP, ADP and AMPcPP, an ATP analogue. Despite the similar overall architecture, the protein shows significant structural variations from other CD-NTases. Adjacent to the donor substrate, another nucleotide is bound to the acceptor binding site by a non-productive mode. Isothermal titration calorimetry results also suggest the presence of two ATP binding sites. GTP alone does not bind to EcCdnD, which however binds to pppApG, a possible intermediate.

33835156,Metabolic engineering of Vibrio natriegens.,Essays in biochemistry,"Vibrio natriegens is emerging as a promising host for biotechnology which is basically due to the remarkable intrinsic properties such as the exceptionally high growth and substrate consumption rates. The facultatively anaerobic marine bacterium possesses a versatile metabolism, is able to utilize a variety of substrates as carbon and energy sources and is easy to handle in the lab. These features initiated the rapid development of genetic tools and resulted in extensive engineering of production strains in the past years. Although recent examples illustrate the potential of V. natriegens for biotechnology, a comprehensive understanding of the metabolism and its regulation is still lacking but essential to exploit the full potential of this bacterium. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the physiological traits and the genomic organization, provide an overview of the available genetic engineering tools and recent advances in metabolic engineering of V. natriegens. Finally, we discuss the obstacles which have to be overcome in order to establish V. natriegens as industrial production host.",10.1042/EBC20200135,"[{'lastname': 'Thoma', 'firstname': 'Felix', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Microbial Biotechnology, Campus Straubing for Biotechnology and Sustainability, Technical University of Munich, Schulgasse 22, 94315 Straubing, Germany.\nSynBiofoundry@TUM, Technical University of Munich, Schulgasse 22, 94315 Straubing, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Blombach', 'firstname': 'Bastian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Microbial Biotechnology, Campus Straubing for Biotechnology and Sustainability, Technical University of Munich, Schulgasse 22, 94315 Straubing, Germany.\nSynBiofoundry@TUM, Technical University of Munich, Schulgasse 22, 94315 Straubing, Germany.'}]"

Additionally, the workshop emphasized the need for rigorous health screening prior to enrolment; suitable infrastructure for containment; and personnel to provide appropriate treatment including emergency resuscitation and evacuation if indicated. Specific recommendations included compensation for burden of participation; access to care and provision for study related injury (e.g. no-fault insurance); and withdrawal and exit procedures to preserve individual and community safety.

33831221,Vibrio parahaemolyticus CadC regulates acid tolerance response to enhance bacterial motility and cytotoxicity.,Journal of fish diseases,"Pathogens adapted to sub-lethal acidic conditions could increase the virulence and survival ability under lethal conditions. In the aquaculture industry, feed acidifiers have been used to increase the growth of aquatic animals. However, there is limited study on the effects of acidic condition on the virulence and survival of pathogens in aquaculture. In this study, we investigated the survival ability of Vibrio parahaemolyticus at lethal acidic pH (4.0) after adapted the bacteria to sub-lethal acidic pH (5.5) for 1 hr. Our results indicated that the adapted strain increased the survival ability at lethal acidic pH invoked by an inorganic (HCl) or organic (citric) acid. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) results revealed that 321 genes were differentially expressed at the sub-lethal acidic pH including cadC, cadBA and groES/groEL relating to acid tolerance response (ATR), as well as genes relating to outer membrane, heat-shock proteins, phosphotransferase system and flagella system. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed that cadC and cadBA were upregulated under sub-lethal acidic conditions. The CadC protein could directly regulate the expression of cadBA to modulate the ATR in V. parahaemolyticus. RNA-seq data also indicated that 113 genes in the CadC-dependent way and 208 genes in the CadC-independent way were differentially expressed, which were related to the regulation of ATR. Finally, the motility and cytotoxicity of the sub-lethal acidic adapted wild type (WT) were significantly increased compared with the unadapted strain. Our results demonstrated that the dietary acidifiers may increase the virulence and survival of V. parahaemolyticus in aquaculture.",10.1111/jfd.13376,"[{'lastname': 'Gu', 'firstname': 'Dan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Zoonosis/Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, China.\nKey Laboratory of Prevention and Control of Biological Hazard Factors (Animal Origin) for Agrifood Safety and Quality, Ministry of Agriculture of China, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.\nJoint International Research Laboratory of Agriculture and Agri-product Safety of the Ministry of Education, Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Kangru', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Zoonosis/Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Tianyu', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Zoonosis/Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Lingzhi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Zoonosis/Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiao', 'firstname': 'Xinan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Zoonosis/Jiangsu Co-innovation Center for Prevention and Control of Important Animal Infectious Diseases and Zoonoses, Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, China.\nKey Laboratory of Prevention and Control of Biological Hazard Factors (Animal Origin) for Agrifood Safety and Quality, Ministry of Agriculture of China, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.\nJoint International Research Laboratory of Agriculture and Agri-product Safety of the Ministry of Education, Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, China.'}]"

33813704,Occurrence and antibiogram signatures of some Vibrio species recovered from selected rivers in South West Nigeria.,Environmental science and pollution research international,"Vibrio species, widely distributed in water environments, has emerged as a prominent cause of water and food-related disease outbreaks posing significant risk to human and animal health worldwide. About 40% of presumptive isolates recovered from four selected rivers in Southwest Nigeria and, established as Vibrio species genus through polymerase chain reaction techniques., were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing against a panel of 18 commonly used antibiotics. The relative prevalence of key Vibrio species (V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, V. mimicus, V. harveyi, and V. cholerae) was in the order 17%, 13.3%, 4.4%, 2.2%, and 2.2% respectively. Antibiotic resistance by all Vibrio species was mostly observed against doxycycline (71-89%), erythromycin (86-100%), tetracycline (71-89%), rifampicin (86-100%), and sulfamethoxazole (87-100%), though susceptibility to meropenem (86-100%), cephalothin (60-100%), norfloxacin (93-100%), ciprofloxacin (88-100%), amikacin (64-100%), gentamicin (57-74%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (57-81%) was equally observed in all species. Vibrio mimicus expressed highest resistance against streptomycin and chloramphenicol (64%), while V. vulnificus (52%) and V. cholerae (57%) had the highest resistance against cephalothin. High resistance against ampicillin (57%) and amoxicillin (50%) was exhibited by V. cholerae and V. mimicus respectively. Indexes of multiple antibiotic resistances (MARI) among Vibrio species ranged between 0.11 and 0.72 with the highest MAR index of 0.72 observed in one isolate of V. vulnificus. This study reveals high prevalence of Vibrio species in the selected rivers as well as elevated resistance against some first-line antibiotics, which suggests possible inappropriate antimicrobial usage around study communities. We conclude that the freshwater resources investigated are unfit for domestic, industrial, and recreational uses without treatment prior to use and are potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant Vibrio species in this environment.","10.1007/s11356-021-13603-4

33813268,Structural analysis of the activation and DNA interactions of the response regulator VbrR from Vibrio parahaemolyticus.,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,"VbrK and VbrR from the gastroenteritis-causing Vibrio parahaemolyticus are a histidine kinase and response regulator, respectively, that constitute a two-component regulatory system. VbrK responds to β-lactam antibiotics or nitrate and activates VbrR via phosphorylation. Consequently, VbrR transcriptionally regulates the expression of β-lactamase and ExsC and contributes to the survival or virulence of V. parahaemolyticus. Due to the unavailability of the VbrR structure, it remains unclear how VbrR is activated via its N-terminal receiver domain (RD) and recognizes dsDNA via its C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD). To reveal the mechanism underlying VbrR-mediated activation, we generated the phosphomimetic protein (VbrR",10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.03.114,"[{'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'So Yeon', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biomedical Convergence, College of Biomedical Science, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, 24341, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoon', 'firstname': 'Sung-Il', 'initials': 'SI', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biomedical Convergence, College of Biomedical Science, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, 24341, Republic of Korea.

33833236,Role of DegQ in differential stability of flagellin subunits in Vibrio vulnificus.,NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,"Biofilm formation of Vibrio vulnificus is initiated by adherence of flagellated cells to surfaces, and then flagellum-driven motility is not necessary during biofilm maturation. Once matured biofilms are constructed, cells become flagellated and swim to disperse from biofilms. As a consequence, timely regulations of the flagellar components' expression are crucial to complete a biofilm life-cycle. In this study, we demonstrated that flagellins' production is regulated in a biofilm stage-specific manner, via activities of a protease DegQ and a chaperone FlaJ. Among four flagellin subunits for V. vulnificus filament, FlaC had the highest affinities to hook-associated proteins, and is critical for maturating flagellum, showed the least susceptibility to DegQ due to the presence of methionine residues in its DegQ-sensitive domains, ND1 and CD0. Therefore, differential regulation by DegQ and FlaJ controls the cytoplasmic stability of flagellins, which further determines the motility-dependent, stage-specific development of biofilms.","10.1038/s41522-021-00206-7

33813704,Occurrence and antibiogram signatures of some Vibrio species recovered from selected rivers in South West Nigeria.,Environmental science and pollution research international,"Vibrio species, widely distributed in water environments, has emerged as a prominent cause of water and food-related disease outbreaks posing significant risk to human and animal health worldwide. About 40% of presumptive isolates recovered from four selected rivers in Southwest Nigeria and, established as Vibrio species genus through polymerase chain reaction techniques., were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing against a panel of 18 commonly used antibiotics. The relative prevalence of key Vibrio species (V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, V. mimicus, V. harveyi, and V. cholerae) was in the order 17%, 13.3%, 4.4%, 2.2%, and 2.2% respectively. Antibiotic resistance by all Vibrio species was mostly observed against doxycycline (71-89%), erythromycin (86-100%), tetracycline (71-89%), rifampicin (86-100%), and sulfamethoxazole (87-100%), though susceptibility to meropenem (86-100%), cephalothin (60-100%), norfloxacin (93-100%), ciprofloxacin (88-100%), amikacin (64-100%), gentamicin (57-74%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (57-81%) was equally observed in all species. Vibrio mimicus expressed highest resistance against streptomycin and chloramphenicol (64%), while V. vulnificus (52%) and V. cholerae (57%) had the highest resistance against cephalothin. High resistance against ampicillin (57%) and amoxicillin (50%) was exhibited by V. cholerae and V. mimicus respectively. Indexes of multiple antibiotic resistances (MARI) among Vibrio species ranged between 0.11 and 0.72 with the highest MAR index of 0.72 observed in one isolate of V. vulnificus. This study reveals high prevalence of Vibrio species in the selected rivers as well as elevated resistance against some first-line antibiotics, which suggests possible inappropriate antimicrobial usage around study communities. We conclude that the freshwater resources investigated are unfit for domestic, industrial, and recreational uses without treatment prior to use and are potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant Vibrio species in this environment.","10.1007/s11356-021-13603-4

33789126,Sensitively and quickly detecting Vibrio vulnificus by real time recombinase polymerase amplification targeted to vvhA gene.,Molecular and cellular probes,"Vibrio vulnificus (V. vulnificus) is a Gram-negative bacterium living in warm and salty water. This marine bacterium could produce hemolysin (VVH), which often causes serious gastroenteritis or septicemia when people contact to seawater or seafood containing V. vulnificus. Timely diagnosis is regard as essential to disease surveillance. In this paper, we aimed at developing a quick and sensitive method for the detection of Vibrio vulnificus using real time recombinase polymerase amplification (real time RPA). Specific primers and an exo probe were designed on the basis of the vvhA gene sequence available in GenBank. Target DNA could be amplified and labeled with specific fluorophore within 20 min at 38 °C. The method exhibited a high specificity, only detecting Vibrio vulnificus and not showing cross-reaction with other bacteria. The sensitivity of this method was 2 pg per reaction (20 μL) for DNA, or 200 copies per reaction (20 μL) for standard plasmid.

Weekly entomological collections with ovitraps and BG-sentinel traps were performed in 1-ha quadrants of both localities for 1 yr. Three distinct periods/phases were identified, closely associated with precipitation: 1) a phase of low population abundance during the dry season (weekly average of Aedes eggs per ovitrap and adults per BG trap = 15.51 ± 0.71 and 10.07 ± 0.88, respectively); 2) a phase of population growth and greatest abundance of Aedes (49.03 ± 1.48 eggs and 25.69 ± 1.31 adults) during the rainy season; and finally 3) a phase of decline among populations (20.91 ± 0.97 eggs and 3.24 ± 0.21 adults) after the peak of the rainy season. Seasonal abundance and dynamics of Ae. aegypti populations suggest that it is feasible to develop and implement time-specific actions as part of an IVM approach incorporating integrating novel technologies (such as rear-and-release of Wolbachia-infected males) with classic (insecticide-based) approaches implemented routinely for vector control. In agreement with the local vector control program, we propose a pilot IVM strategy structured in a preparation phase, an attack phase with traditional vector control, and a suppression phase with inundative releases, which are described in this paper.",10.1093/jme/tjab052,"[{'lastname': 'Che-Mendoza', 'firstname': 'Azael', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Laboratorio para el Control Biológico de Aedes aegypti (LCB-UADY), Unidad Colaborativa para Bioensayos Entomológicos (UCBE), Campus de Ciencias Biológicas y Agropecuarias, Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán, Km. 15.5 Carr.

33798671,Estimating hybridization as a consequence of climatic fluctuations: a case study of two Geometridae species.,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,"In some cases, the phylogenetic analysis based on the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the nuclear DNA (ncDNA) are discordant. There are three major causes of the discordance within insects, including hybridization, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and infection by Wolbachia. In this study, we used a combination of multilocus and coalescent analyses to explore these processes occurred during the evolutionary history of Limbatochlamys rosthorni Rothschild, 1894 and Limbatochlamys pararosthorni Han and Xue, 2005. The ncDNA phylogenetic tree supported two reciprocally monophyletic species, whereas the mtDNA results failed to reveal such a structure and revealed an extensive level of admixture between two species. Because of very low Wolbachia infection rates (<20%), we firstly excluded this reason for the discordance. The fixed nucleotide differences and large genetic distances (1.5-2.5%) at the ncDNA genes suggested that the lineage sorting process between these two species is nearly complete and two species have experienced a prolonged period of independent evolution. Thus, we secondly excluded ILS. Sharing haplotypes, mtDNA gene flow occurring and the transitional samples with morphological features supported hybridization. The distribution contraction during glaciations and postglacial distribution expansion might have facilitated hybridization. Taken together, our study indicates that the current genetic structure of L. rosthorni and L. pararosthorni is the results of contraction and fragmentation into separated refugia during glaciations, followed by postglacial expansion and admixture.",10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107168,"[{'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Nan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Zoological Systematics and Evolution, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xue', 'firstname': 'Da-Yong', 'initials': 'DY', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Zoological Systematics and Evolution, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Hong-Xiang', 'initials': 'HX', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Zoological Systematics and Evolution, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

Despite an encouraging start, numbers of ferrets at the site have declined. In an effort to determine possible causes of the population decline, we undertook a pathogen survey in 2012 to detect exposure to West Nile virus (WNV), canine distemper virus (CDV), plague (Yersinia pestis), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) using coyotes (Canis latrans) as a sentinel animal. The highest seroprevalence was for WNV with 71% (20/28) of coyotes testing antibody-positive. Seroprevalence of CDV and plague were lower, 27% and 13%, respectively. No evidence of active infection with tularemia or heartworm was seen in the coyotes sampled. As this study did not sample black-footed ferrets themselves, the definitive cause for the decline of this population cannot be determined. However, the presence of coyotes seropositive for two diseases, plague and CDV, lethal to black-footed ferrets, indicated the potential for exposure and infection. The high seroprevalence of WNV in the coyotes indicated a wide exposure to the virus; therefore, exposure of black-footed ferrets to the virus is also likely. Due to the ability of WNV to cause fatal disease in other species, studies may be useful to elucidate the impact that WNV could have on the success of reintroduced black-footed ferrets as well as factors influencing the spread and incidence of the disease in a prairie ecosystem.",10.7589/JWD-D-20-00015,"[{'lastname': 'Schuler', 'firstname': 'Krysten', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Claymore', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Prairie Management Program, PO Box 590, Eagle Butte, South Dakota 57625, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schnitzler', 'firstname': 'Hannah', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dubovi', 'firstname': 'Edward', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Cornell University, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rocke', 'firstname': 'Tonie', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, 6006 Schroeder Rd., Madison, Wisconsin 53711, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Perry', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center Biodefense Laboratory, 120 New Scotland Ave., Albany, New York 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bowman', 'firstname': 'Dwight', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, C4 119 Veterinary Medical Center, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abbott', 'firstname': 'Rachel C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, 6006 Schroeder Rd., Madison, Wisconsin 53711, USA.'}]"
33811020,Colonization with Gastrointestinal Pathogens Prior to Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Associated Clinical Implications.,Transplantation and cellular therapy,"Infectious diarrhea following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality. Most HCT recipients experience diarrhea in the post-transplantation period, and infectious pathogens are frequently detected during diarrheal episodes. However, little is known about how frequently these patients are colonized with gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens before their transplantation and whether colonization predicts future diarrheal illness. We sought to determine how frequently HCT recipients are colonized with GI pathogens before HCT and the degree to which pre-HCT colonization predicts post-transplantation infectious diarrheal illness. We conducted a prospective cohort study of allogeneic and autologous HCT recipients at a single center between December 2016 and January 2019. Stool samples were collected during the week before HCT, and formed samples were evaluated for the presence of 22 diarrheal pathogens using the BioFire FilmArray GI panel. We determined the frequency with which participants were colonized with each pathogen and identified factors associated with colonization. We then determined how frequently pretransplantation colonization led to post-transplantation diarrheal infections due to the colonizing pathogen and whether colonization was associated with increased number of days of post-transplantation diarrhea during the transplant hospitalization. We enrolled 112 asymptomatic patients (allogeneic, 61%; autologous, 39%) who had a formed stool specimen before HCT, of whom 41 (37%) had a GI pathogen detected. The most commonly detected organisms were Clostridioides difficile (n = 21; 19%), Yersinia enterocolitica (n = 9; 8%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (n = 6; 6%), and norovirus (n = 5; 4%). Female sex and previous C. difficile infection were associated with C. difficile colonization, and having non-Hodgkin lymphoma was associated with being colonized with a diarrheal pathogen other than C. difficile. Thirteen of 21 patients (62%) with pretransplantation C. difficile colonization developed a clinical C. difficile infection post-transplantation, and 8 of 10 patients (80%) colonized with EPEC or enteroaggregative E. coli developed post-transplantation infections due to their colonizing pathogen. Pretransplantation C. difficile colonization was also associated with an increased duration of post-transplantation diarrhea (P = .048). Conversely, none of the 9 patients with pretransplantation Yersinia enterocolitica colonization developed a post-transplantation Y. enterocolitica infection.

Despite an encouraging start, numbers of ferrets at the site have declined. In an effort to determine possible causes of the population decline, we undertook a pathogen survey in 2012 to detect exposure to West Nile virus (WNV), canine distemper virus (CDV), plague (Yersinia pestis), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) using coyotes (Canis latrans) as a sentinel animal. The highest seroprevalence was for WNV with 71% (20/28) of coyotes testing antibody-positive. Seroprevalence of CDV and plague were lower, 27% and 13%, respectively. No evidence of active infection with tularemia or heartworm was seen in the coyotes sampled. As this study did not sample black-footed ferrets themselves, the definitive cause for the decline of this population cannot be determined. However, the presence of coyotes seropositive for two diseases, plague and CDV, lethal to black-footed ferrets, indicated the potential for exposure and infection. The high seroprevalence of WNV in the coyotes indicated a wide exposure to the virus; therefore, exposure of black-footed ferrets to the virus is also likely. Due to the ability of WNV to cause fatal disease in other species, studies may be useful to elucidate the impact that WNV could have on the success of reintroduced black-footed ferrets as well as factors influencing the spread and incidence of the disease in a prairie ecosystem.",10.7589/JWD-D-20-00015,"[{'lastname': 'Schuler', 'firstname': 'Krysten', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Claymore', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, Prairie Management Program, PO Box 590, Eagle Butte, South Dakota 57625, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schnitzler', 'firstname': 'Hannah', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Cornell Wildlife Health Lab, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dubovi', 'firstname': 'Edward', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Cornell University, 240 Farrier Rd., Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rocke', 'firstname': 'Tonie', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, 6006 Schroeder Rd., Madison, Wisconsin 53711, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Perry', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center Biodefense Laboratory, 120 New Scotland Ave., Albany, New York 12208, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bowman', 'firstname': 'Dwight', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, C4 119 Veterinary Medical Center, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abbott', 'firstname': 'Rachel C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': 'US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center, 6006 Schroeder Rd., Madison, Wisconsin 53711, USA.'}]"

Researchers have questioned the means by which Y. pestis is maintained in nature and also sought methods for managing the disease. Here we assessed the efficacy of a new tool, the sylvatic plague vaccine (SPV), in wild-caught northern grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster) and commercially acquired Sonoran deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus sonoriensis). More than 40% of the animals survived a subcutaneous Y. pestis challenge of 175,000 colony forming units (over 30,000 times the white mouse 50% lethal dose) in both vaccine-treated and control groups.

When confronted with foreign material or invading pathogens, these cells mount a robust response. Nevertheless, many bacterial pathogens with an intracellular lifecycle stage exploit this environment for replication and survival. These include, but are not limited to, Coxiella burnetii, Legionella pneumophila, Yersinia pestis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Currently, few human disease-relevant model systems exist for studying host-pathogen interactions during these bacterial infections in the lung. Here, we present two novel infection platforms, human alveolar macrophages (hAMs) and human precision cut lung slices (hPCLS), along with an up-to-date synopsis of research using said models. Additionally, alternative uses for these systems in the absence of pathogen involvement are presented, such as tissue banking and further characterization of the human lung environment. Overall, hAMs and hPCLS allow novel human disease-relevant investigations that other models, such as cell lines and animal models, cannot completely provide.",10.1093/femspd/ftab016,"[{'lastname': 'Dragan', 'firstname': 'Amanda L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Voth', 'firstname': 'Daniel E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.'}]"

33705525,Characterization of the binding motif for the T3SS master regulator LcrF in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.,FEMS microbiology letters,"LcrF is the master regulator that positively regulates the Ysc type III secretion system (T3SS) in Yersinia and shares high similarity to the DNA binding domain of the T3SS master regulator ExsA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on these features, bioinformatics analysis has predicted putative LcrF binding site in its target promoters. Here we experimentally characterized its binding motif. An A-rich LcrF binding region in the lcrG promoter sequence, a typical regulatory target of LcrF, was first confirmed. To obtain detailed information, this binding region was cloned into a synthetized promoter and mutations in this region were further constructed. We demonstrated that the 5'-AAAAA-n5-GnCT-3' sequence is required for LcrF regulation and this motif is strictly located 4-bp upstream of a noncanonical promoter, in which the -35 and -10 elements are separated by a 21-bp spacer. Consistently, the putative binding motif was found in promoters of nine T3SS related operons or genes positively regulated by LcrF. Transcriptome analysis further confirmed that LcrF specifically activates T3SS genes in Yersinia. Collectively, our data suggest that LcrF is evolved to be a specific T3SS activator with stringent sequence requirement for transcriptional regulation.",10.1093/femsle/fnab031,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Luyi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Shaojia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.\nUniversity of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fei', 'firstname': 'Keke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.\nUniversity of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.\nUniversity of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Shiyun', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Yangbo', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China.'}]"

33796488,Factors Associated With MALDI-TOF Mass Spectral Quality of Species Identification in Clinical Routine Diagnostics.,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,"An accurate and timely identification of bacterial species is critical in clinical diagnostics. Species identification allows a potential first adaptation of empiric antibiotic treatments before the resistance profile is available. Matrix assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a widely used method for bacterial species identification. However, important challenges in species identification remain. These arise from (i) incomplete databases, (ii) close relatedness of species of interest, and (iii) spectral quality, which is currently vaguely defined.
We selected 47 clinically relevant bacterial isolates from 39 species, which can be challenging to identify by MALDI-TOF MS. We measured these isolates under various analytical conditions on two MALDI-TOF MS systems. First, we identified spectral features, which were associated with correct species identification in three different databases. Considering these features, we then systematically compared spectra produced with three different sample preparation protocols. In addition, we varied quantities of bacterial colony material applied and bacterial colony age.
We identified (i) the number of ribosomal marker peaks detected, (ii) the median relative intensity of ribosomal marker peaks, (iii) the sum of the intensity of all detected peaks, (iv) a high measurement precision, and (v) reproducibility of peaks to act as good proxies of spectral quality. We found that using formic acid, measuring bacterial colonies at a young age, and frequently calibrating the MALDI-TOF MS device increase mass spectral quality. We further observed significant differences in spectral quality between different bacterial taxa and optimal measurement conditions vary per taxon.
We identified and applied quality measures for MALDI-TOF MS and optimized spectral quality in routine settings. Phylogenetic marker peaks can be reproducibly detected and provide an increased resolution and the ability to distinguish between challenging species such as those within the ",10.3389/fcimb.2021.646648,"[{'lastname': 'Cuénod', 'firstname': 'Aline', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Applied Microbiology Research, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.\nDivision of Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Foucault', 'firstname': 'Frédéric', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Mabritec AG, Riehen, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pflüger', 'firstname': 'Valentin', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Mabritec AG, Riehen, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Egli', 'firstname': 'Adrian', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Applied Microbiology Research, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.\nDivision of Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}]"

Retrospective analysis of clinical records of dogs diagnosed with a melting corneal ulcer presented to a referral hospital in Hertfordshire, UK between 2014 and 2018.
One hundred and ten melting corneal ulcers were sampled in 106 dogs. The most common pure bacterial isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 26) followed by β-hemolytic Streptococcus (n = 12). Melting corneal ulcers that cultured coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, coliform bacteria, Pasteurella multocida, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus viridans presented in smaller numbers and were analyzed together (n = 16). Multiple cultures were identified in nine cases (n = 9). Forty-seven cultures yielded no bacterial growth (n = 47). The susceptibility to fluoroquinolones remained high with the exception of β-hemolytic Streptococci. There was no significant difference in the ulcer severity at presentation in regard to the cultured bacteria. Overall, 63 eyes (57%) received surgical grafting in addition to medical treatment. In 14 cases (13%), the progression of corneal melting despite medical ± surgical treatment resulted in enucleation. Fifty-seven percent (8/14) of the enucleated eyes cultured pure Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. In contrast, all β-hemolytic Streptococcus-associated ulcers healed.
The most common bacterial species associated with canine keratomalacia were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and β-hemolytic Streptococcus. Because of the variation in antibacterial sensitivity between these two species, bacterial culture and sensitivity testing should be performed in all dogs presenting with keratomalacia. Melting corneal ulcers associated with pure Pseudomonas infection were significantly more likely to result in globe loss than melting corneal ulcers associated with other cultures.",10.1111/vop.12885,"[{'lastname': 'Tsvetanova', 'firstname': 'Agata', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Davies Veterinary Specialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Hertfordshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Powell', 'firstname': 'Roger M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Veterinary Pathology Group, Hitchin, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsvetanov', 'firstname': 'Kamen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Kerry M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Davies Veterinary Specialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Hertfordshire, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gould', 'firstname': 'David J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Davies Veterinary Specialists, Manor Farm Business Park, Hertfordshire, UK.'}]"

33739035,Assessment of the Optochin Susceptibility Test to Differentiate Streptococcus pneumoniae from other Viridans Group Streptococci.,Clinical laboratory,"Streptococcus pneumoniae identification has traditionally been based on two biochemical tests, susceptibility of pneumococci to optochin and solubility in bile-salt solution. Due to slowness and sometimes difficulty in interpretation, the bile solubility test has fallen into disuse. The main objective of this work was to assess the current effectiveness of the optochin susceptibility test in pneumococcal identification in clinical practice.
Overall 126 viridans group streptococci consecutively isolated from respiratory samples were analyzed using the optochin susceptibility test by picking one colony from the culture. Sixty-two were initially considered optochin susceptible, and 64 were considered optochin resistant and analyzed with the bile solubility test. If a discrepancy between the tests was observed (i.e., whether an isolate was optochin susceptible and bile insoluble or optochin resistant and bile soluble), then the optochin susceptibility test was repeated, adjusting the inoculum to a McFarland standard of 0.5. Species were identified by sequencing the lytA and recA genes.
Twelve discrepancies were initially observed. The result of the repeated optochin test showed that the initial optochin test of 4 isolates had been wrongly interpreted. Of the remaining 8 discrepancies, 2 optochin-resistant bile-soluble isolates were identified by gene sequencing as S. pneumoniae, and of the 6 optochin-susceptible bile-nonsoluble isolates, 3 were identified as Streptococcus mitis and 3 as Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae.
The optochin test correctly identified 90.5% of all recent viridans group streptococci clinical isolates which include both optochin susceptible (62/126 = 49.2%) and optochin resistant (64/126 = 50.8%) strains. Of the group of optochin susceptible viridans, 87.5% were correctly identified, and 93.5% of the optochin resistant group were correctly identified. However, this technique does not correctly differentiate between S. pneumoniae from other viridans group streptococci in the clinical setting.

33831627,Responses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to a Bti-based insecticide in artificial microcosm streams.,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)","Bioinsecticides based on the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) are increasingly being applied directly into aquatic compartments to control nuisance mosquitoes and blackflies and are generally considered environmentally friendly alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Bti-based insecticides are considered highly selective, being Diptera-specific, and supposedly decompose rapidly in the environment. Nevertheless, their safety to non-target species and freshwater ecosystems has been questioned by recent studies, which in fact document possible indirect effects in aquatic food webs such as the decrease of prey availability to predators. This work aimed to evaluate the potential effects of a Bti-based insecticide (VectoBac® 12AS) on a freshwater macroinvertebrate community and on stream ecological functions by using artificial microcosm streams. Artificial microcosm streams were colonized with a macroinvertebrate community plus periphyton collected in a stream together with Alnus glutinosa leaf packs. They were exposed for 7 days to different Bti treatments (0, 12, 120, 1200 μg/L), which are within the recommended concentrations of application in aquatic compartments for blackfly and mosquito control. Besides invertebrate community structure and abundance, effects were evaluated regarding leaf decomposition and primary production as measures of ecosystem functioning. Community structure was significantly altered in all Bti treatments after 7 days of exposure, mostly due to a decline in chironomids, followed by oligochaetes, which both belong to the deposit-feeders' functional group. Direct effects on oligochaetes are surprising and require further research. Also, reductions of leaf decomposition due to Bti-induced sublethal effects on shredders (reduced feeding) or mortality of chironomids (that can also feed on coarse organic matter) observed in our study, represent potential indirect effects of Bti in aquatic ecosystems. Our short-exposure experiment evidenced some negative effects on stream benthic invertebrate communities and on ecosystem functioning that must be considered whenever Bti is used in water bodies for blackfly or mosquito control programs.",10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117030,"[{'lastname': 'Bordalo', 'firstname': 'Maria D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'CESAM - Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies, Department of Biology, University of Aveiro, Portugal.

33831084,Electrical signalling on Bt and non-Bt cotton plants under stress by Aphis gossypii.,PloS one,"Plants have developed various mechanisms to respond specifically to each biotrophic attack. It has been shown that the electrical signals emitted by plants are associated with herbivory stress responses and can lead to the activation of multiple defences. Bt cotton is a genetically modified pest-resistant plant that produces an insecticide from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) to control Lepidopteran species. Surprisingly, there is no study-yet, that characterizes the signalling mechanisms in transgenic cotton plants attacked by non-target insects, such as aphids. In this study, we characterized the production of electrical signals on Bt and non-Bt cotton plants infested with Aphis gossypii and, in addition, we characterized the dispersal behaviour of aphids to correlate this behaviour to plant signalling responses. Electrical signalling of the plants was recorded with an extracellular measurement technique. Impressively, our results showed that both Bt and non-Bt cotton varieties, when attacked by A. gossypii, emitted potential variation-type electrical signals and clearly showed the presence of distinct responses regarding their perception and the behaviour of aphids, with evidence of delay, in terms of signal amount, and almost twice the amount of Cry1F protein was observed on Bt cotton plants at the highest density of insects/plant.

The role of antimicrobial agents in the management of periodontal diseases is of utmost importance. However, in the present scenario, antibiotic resistance is a public health concern now and there are very few options left for treatment. So, honey, a pioneer in traditional medicine was tried in the treatment against Escherichia coli to evaluate and compare the ""in-vitro"" antibacterial activity and efficacy of raw and commercial honey at different concentrations in comparison to tetracycline as a control on patient-isolated Escherichia coli and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Escherichia coli 25922 strain from 5th Aug 2018 to 15th Feb 2019 at the Department of Microbiology, Rama Medical College, Kanpur (UP), India. In the in-vitro study different concentrations (100%, 75%, 50% and 25% v/v) of raw and commercial honey were studied and sensitivity tests were used to evaluate their antibacterial effect on patient-isolated Escherichia coli and the ATCC Escherichia coli 25922 strain. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were also determined for raw honey, and commercial honey in comparison to tetracycline. In case of raw honey, zone of inhibition was seen at 100%, 75% and 50% concentration, with maximum inhibition being 27±1.154mm and 23±0.666mm for patient-isolated Escherichia coli and ATCC Escherichia coli 25922 strain respectively at 100% concentration, whereas, the commercial honey was effective only at 100% and 75% concentration, with maximum inhibition zone of 13±1.054mm and 17±0.942mm at 100% concentration on patient-isolated Escherichia coli and ATCC Escherichia coli 25922 strain respectively. However, no effect was observed at 25% concentration for both raw and commercial honey. The MIC and MBC of raw and commercial honey were determined by the broth dilution method, where raw honey exhibited both MIC and MBC at 512 mg/ml whereas, and commercial honey exhibited MIC at 512mg/ml and MBC at 1024 mg/ml respectively. While comparing the zone of inhibition of raw and commercial honey, it was observed that the raw honey showed almost equivalent potency and efficacy as compared to a positive control tetracycline (2.5%). There was statistically significant difference (p≤0.01) in zone of inhibition of raw and commercial honey at 100% concentration on patient-isolated Escherichia coli and ATCC Escherichia coli 25922 strain. Antimicrobial activity of raw honey at 100% concentration was equivalent to that of tetracycline and was significantly better than commercial honey.",,"[{'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Professor Dr Ira Gupta, Professor, Department of Periodontology, Rama Dental College, Hospital & Research Centre (RDC, H&RC), Kanpur (UP)- 208024, India; E-mail: driragupta@yahoo.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Das', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ranjan', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sujatha', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]"
33826149,Variations in IgG antibody subclass responses to oral bacteria: Effects of periodontal disease and modifying factors.,Journal of periodontal research,"Local and systemic IgG antibodies or oral bacteria have been described with periodontitis. We extended these observations by assessing the impact of a range of intrinsic factors on serum IgG subclass antibodies to both commensal and pathogenic oral bacteria that would contribute to variations in immune protection or disease susceptibility in periodontitis have not been described.
Subjects (n = 278) were classified as healthy, gingivitis, or periodontitis and categorized as mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis. Demographic stratification included sex, age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and obesity. Whole formalin-fixed bacteria were used as antigens to detect serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass antibody levels using an ELISA.
The greatest differences in variations in IgG subclasses occurred in periodontitis versus health or gingivitis to bacteria considered oral pathogens (eg, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola) with IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 increased by three- to sevenfold with Pg. Differences in subclass levels and distribution were also observed related to disease severity, particularly related to individual subclass responses to Pg. Examination of the overall population showed that females had elevated antibody, reflected by elevated IgG2 amounts/proportions. The older group of subjects demonstrated elevated antibody to multiple oral bacteria, lacking any particular subclass pattern. IgG2 antibody to Aa and Pg was increased in smokers. Multiple IgG subclass antibody levels to oral pathogens were significantly decreased in the obese subset within this population.
This investigation identified patterns of IgG subclass antibody responses to oral bacteria and demonstrated substantial effects of disease impacting the level and subclass distribution of antibody to an array of oral bacteria. Altered subclass antibody profiles most often in IgG2 levels and for antibody to P. gingivalis were found related to sex, age, disease severity, race/ethnicity, smoking, and obesity to both pathogens and commensal bacteria.",10.1111/jre.12882,"[{'lastname': 'Ebersole', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Science, School of Dental Medicine, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.\nCenter for Oral Health Research, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamzeh', 'firstname': 'Razan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Oral Health Research, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.\nDivision of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Linh', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Science, School of Dental Medicine, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Sabbagh', 'firstname': 'Mohanad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dawson', 'firstname': 'Dolph', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Center for Oral Health Research, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.\nDivision of Periodontology, College of Dentistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.'}]"

The etiology and pathogenesis of OLP are still unclear.
We analyzed the bacterial community structure of buccal mucosa in patients with OLP and normal controls by high-throughput sequencing. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was uesd to detect Prevotella melaninogenica (P. melaninogenica) in 13 OLP samples and 10 controls. The amounts of P. melaninogenica in OLP buccal mucosa and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in co-culture of mouse-derived macrophages with P. melaninogenica were detected by RT-qPCR.
The P. melaninogenica was more abundant in OLP than in healthy controls and the differences were significant at the level of the phylum, family, genus and species (P<0.05). FISH showed that P. melaninogenica can invade the epithelium and even the lamina propria of OLP, while no invasion was found in the normal mucosa. P. melaninogenica can adhere to and invade macrophages and then activate the transcription of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in NF-κB signaling pathway.
P. melaninogenica may be involved in the pathogenic process of OLP, and its specific mechanism deserves further study.",10.1111/odi.13862,"[{'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Sai-Wei', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Pan', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cai', 'firstname': 'Li-Ting', 'initials': 'LT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of life Sciences and technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Zheng-Wu', 'initials': 'ZW', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Yi-Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Rui-Xin', 'initials': 'RX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of life Sciences and technology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Yuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Tooth Restoration and Regeneration, School of Stomatology, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.'}]"
33718263,Dynamic Alterations of Oral Microbiota Related to Halitosis in Preschool Children.,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,"This longitudinal study was aimed to evaluate the dynamic shift in oral microbiota during the process of halitosis progression among preschool children.
The oral examinations, questionnaires and tongue coating specimens were collected at the baseline and 12-month follow-up. All children were oral healthy at the enrollment. At the 12-month follow-up, children who developed halitosis were included to the halitosis group (n = 10). While children who matched the age, gender, kindergarten and without halitosis were included to the control group (n = 10). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to reveal the shift of the tongue coating microbiome in these children during the 12- month period with the Human Oral Microbiome Database.
A remarkable shift in relative abundance of specific bacteria was observed prior to halitosis development. The principal coordinates and alpha diversity analyses revealed different shifting patterns of halitosis and the healthy participants' microbiome structures and bacterial diversity over the 12-month follow-up. Both groups showed variable microbiota community structures before the onset of halitosis. Halitosis-enriched species 
The microbiome composition and relative abundance of the tongue coatings in the halitosis and control groups remarkably differed, even prior to the onset of the clinical manifestations of halitosis. The halitosis prediction model constructed on the basis of tongue coating microbiome biomarkers indicated the microbial shifts before the halitosis onset.

33604753,Characterization of microbiota in acute leukemia patients following successful remission induction chemotherapy without antimicrobial prophylaxis.,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,"In the present study, we characterized the microbiomes of acute leukemia (AL) patients who achieved complete remission following remission induction chemotherapy (RIC) as outpatients, but who did not receive antimicrobials to treat or prevent febrile neutropenia.
Saliva and stool samples from 9 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 11 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 5 healthy controls were subjected to 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing at baseline and at 3 months following RIC. Only patients who achieved remission at 3 months post-treatment were included. We excluded anyone who used antimicrobials within 2 months of enrollment or at any time during the study period.
At baseline, the relative abundances of species of Prevotella maculosa (P=0.001), Megasphaera micronuciformis (P=0.014), Roseburia inulinivorans (P=0.021), and Bacteroides uniformis (P=0.004) in saliva and Prevotella copri (P=0.002) in the stools of controls were significantly higher than in AL patients. Following RIC, the relative abundances of Eubacterium sp. oral clone DO008 (P=0.012), Leptotrichia sp. oral clone IK040 (P=0.002), Oribacterium sp. oral taxon 108 (P=0.029), Megasphaera micronuciformis (P=0.016), TM7 phylum sp. oral clone DR034 (P<0.001), Roseburia inulinivorans (P=0.034), Actinomyces odontolyticus (P=0.014), Leptotrichia buccalis (P=0.005), and Prevotella melaninogenica (P=0.046) in saliva and Lactobacillus fermentum (P=0.046), Coprococcus catus (P=0.050), butyrate-producing bacterium SS3/4 (P=0.013), and Bacteroides coprocola (P=0.027) in the stools of AL patients were significantly greater than in controls.
Following RIC, several taxa are changed in stool and salvia samples of AL patients. Our results warrant future large-scale multicenter studies to examine whether the microbiota might have an effect on clinical outcomes of AL patients.","10.1007/s10123-021-00163-3

33536555,Structural changes in the oral microbiome of the adolescent patients with moderate or severe dental fluorosis.,Scientific reports,"Dental fluorosis is a very prevalent endemic disease. Although oral microbiome has been reported to correlate with different oral diseases, there appears to be an absence of research recognizing any relationship between the severity of dental fluorosis and the oral microbiome. To this end, we investigated the changes in oral microbial community structure and identified bacterial species associated with moderate and severe dental fluorosis. Salivary samples of 42 individuals, assigned into Healthy (N = 9), Mild (N = 14) and Moderate/Severe (M&S, N = 19), were investigated using the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. The oral microbial community structure based on Bray Curtis and Weighted Unifrac were significantly changed in the M&S group compared with both of Healthy and Mild. As the predominant phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes showed variation in the relative abundance among groups. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio was significantly higher in the M&S group. LEfSe analysis was used to identify differentially represented taxa at the species level. Several genera such as Streptococcus mitis, Gemella parahaemolysans, Lactococcus lactis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were significantly more abundant in patients with moderate/severe dental fluorosis, while Prevotella melaninogenica and Schaalia odontolytica were enriched in the Healthy group. In conclusion, our study indicates oral microbiome shift in patients with moderate/severe dental fluorosis. We identified several differentially represented bacterial species enriched in moderate and severe fluorosis.

33822465,"Burkholderia cenocepacia BCAM2418-induced antibody inhibits bacterial adhesion, confers protection to infection and enables identification of host glycans as adhesin targets.",Cellular microbiology,"Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins (TAA) found in Gram-negative bacteria play a key role in virulence. This is the case of Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), a group of related bacteria able to cause infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. These bacteria use TAAs, among other virulence factors, to bind to host protein receptors and their carbohydrate ligands. Blocking such contacts is an attractive approach to inhibit Bcc infections. In this study, using an antibody produced against the TAA BCAM2418 from the epidemic strain Burkholderia cenocepacia K56-2, we were able to uncover its roles as an adhesin and the type of host glycan structures that serve as recognition targets. The neutralization of BCAM2418 was found to cause a reduction in the adhesion of the bacteria to bronchial cells and mucins. Moreover, in vivo studies have shown that the anti-BCAM2418 antibody exerted an inhibitory effect during infection in Galleria mellonella. Finally, inferred by glycan arrays, we were able to predict for the first time, host glycan epitopes for a TAA.

33808547,Bacterial Re-Colonization Occurs Early after Lung Transplantation in Cystic Fibrosis Patients.,Journal of clinical medicine,"Most cystic fibrosis (CF) patients referred for lung transplantation are chronically infected with Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens. It is well known that chronic infections in CF patients have a significant impact on lung-function decline and survival before transplantation. The rate and timing of re-colonization after transplantation have been described, but the impact on survival after stratification of bacteria is not well elucidated. We did a single-center retrospective analysis of 99 consecutive CF patients who underwent lung transplantation since the beginning of the Copenhagen Lung Transplant program in 1992 until October 2014. Two patients were excluded due to re-transplantation. From the time of CF diagnosis, patients had monthly sputum cultures. After transplantation, CF-patients had bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage at 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks and 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after transplantation, as well as sputum samples if relevant. Selected culture results prior to and after transplantation were stored.

33796488,Factors Associated With MALDI-TOF Mass Spectral Quality of Species Identification in Clinical Routine Diagnostics.,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,"An accurate and timely identification of bacterial species is critical in clinical diagnostics. Species identification allows a potential first adaptation of empiric antibiotic treatments before the resistance profile is available. Matrix assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a widely used method for bacterial species identification. However, important challenges in species identification remain. These arise from (i) incomplete databases, (ii) close relatedness of species of interest, and (iii) spectral quality, which is currently vaguely defined.
We selected 47 clinically relevant bacterial isolates from 39 species, which can be challenging to identify by MALDI-TOF MS. We measured these isolates under various analytical conditions on two MALDI-TOF MS systems. First, we identified spectral features, which were associated with correct species identification in three different databases. Considering these features, we then systematically compared spectra produced with three different sample preparation protocols. In addition, we varied quantities of bacterial colony material applied and bacterial colony age.
We identified (i) the number of ribosomal marker peaks detected, (ii) the median relative intensity of ribosomal marker peaks, (iii) the sum of the intensity of all detected peaks, (iv) a high measurement precision, and (v) reproducibility of peaks to act as good proxies of spectral quality. We found that using formic acid, measuring bacterial colonies at a young age, and frequently calibrating the MALDI-TOF MS device increase mass spectral quality. We further observed significant differences in spectral quality between different bacterial taxa and optimal measurement conditions vary per taxon.
We identified and applied quality measures for MALDI-TOF MS and optimized spectral quality in routine settings. Phylogenetic marker peaks can be reproducibly detected and provide an increased resolution and the ability to distinguish between challenging species such as those within the ",10.3389/fcimb.2021.646648,"[{'lastname': 'Cuénod', 'firstname': 'Aline', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Applied Microbiology Research, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.\nDivision of Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Foucault', 'firstname': 'Frédéric', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Mabritec AG, Riehen, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pflüger', 'firstname': 'Valentin', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Mabritec AG, Riehen, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Egli', 'firstname': 'Adrian', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Applied Microbiology Research, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.\nDivision of Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}]"

33770213,Staphylococcus aureus Potentiates the Hemolytic Activity of Burkholderia cepacia Complex (Bcc) Bacteria.,Current microbiology,"Polymicrobial lung infections in individuals with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) contribute to the complexity of this disease and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the CF community. The microorganisms most commonly associated with severe airway infections in individuals with CF are the opportunistic pathogens S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and bacteria from the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), particularly B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans. Three Bcc strains, two S. aureus wild-type strains, and two derivative mutants were used to investigate the interplay between S. aureus and Bcc with a focus on the hemolytic activity of Bcc. Our results revealed that extracellular products from S. aureus potentiated the hemolysis of Bcc strains. Moreover, this effect was influenced by the composition of the medium in which S. aureus is grown. These findings contribute towards the understanding of the impact of interactions between S. aureus and Bcc and their possible implications in the context of co-infections by these pathogens in individuals with CF.","10.1007/s00284-021-02458-0

33823759,"Seasonality in testing and positive respiratory bacterial infections in the Australian Capital Territory, 1997-2007.",Communicable diseases intelligence (2018),"Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Myco) bacteria are atypical pathogens that can cause pneumonia and exacerbate underlying conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the Australian Capital Territory, there is limited information on how seasonal patterns for positive infections and testing may vary, a gap that has implications for control strategies.
We examined seasonal patterns of immunoassay results of patients from Canberra Hospital, Australia, who were tested for Cp and/or Myco. Pathology data, collected from August 1997 to March 2007 from 7,275 patients, were analysed with time series additive decomposition and time series regression.
The proportion of positive Cp infections was highest in March and April (autumn) and lowest in June and August (winter). The proportion of positive Myco infections was highest in December and January (summer) and lowest in August (winter), even though testing for the pathogen peaked in winter with a low in summer. Models with a long-term trend and a variable for month were a better fit for the data than the null models for both infections.
We found differences in seasonal patterns of testing and in the proportion of positive infections. These findings suggest that preventative measures for common infections need to account for seasonal testing practices so as to build an accurate picture of temporal changes in these infections.",10.33321/cdi.2021.45.16,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Xinyi', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Research School of Population Health, Australian National University.'}, {'lastname': 'Lal', 'firstname': 'Aparna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research School of Population Health, Australian National University.'}, {'lastname': 'Richardson', 'firstname': 'Alice', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research School of Population Health, Australian National University.\nStatistical Consulting Unit, Australian National University.'}]"

GENECUBE (TOYOBO) is a novel fully automated gene analyzer capable of amplifying and detecting target DNAs within 50 min. In this study, we developed a new PCR assay with a specific quenching probe (PCR-QC assay) for rapidly distinguishing between Chlamydia pneumoniae (CPN) and Chlamydia psittaci (CPS). The PCR-QC assay enabled us to precisely and simultaneously detect the 2 different types of DNA fragments even in a mixed sample by identifying unique melting temperatures. Next, we examined a total of 300 frozen samples from patients with respiratory tract infection using the PCR-QC assay and the cell culture method as the gold standard. Kappa index for agreement between the PCR-QC assay and the culture method was 0.43 (95% confidential interval (CI): 0.08-0.78). The sensitivity and specificity of the PCR-QC assay were 36.3% (4/11; 95% CI: 10.9-69.2%)) and 99.0% (286/289; 95% CI: 97.0-99.8%), respectively. The samples positive for CPN (n = 13) or CPS (n = 1) by either method were also examined by a conventional PCR TaqMan assay, which produced the same results as those from the PCR-QC assay. Furthermore, the PCR-QC assay using GENECUBE shortened the full detection time for CPN or CPS (within 50 min vs. more than 2 to 3 h) compared with conventional PCR TaqMan assays. Therefore, the new PCR-QC assay system equipped with GENECUBE is useful for rapidly detecting CPN or CPS pathogens in clinical laboratory, and may improve the management of atypical pneumonia.",10.1016/j.mimet.2021.106212,"[{'lastname': 'Hisada', 'firstname': 'Kyoko', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, University of Fukui Hospital, Fukui, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hida', 'firstname': 'Yukio', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, University of Fukui Hospital, Fukui, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawabata', 'firstname': 'Naoki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Municipal Tsuruga Hospital, Fukui, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawashima', 'firstname': 'Yosuke', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic System Department, TOYOBO Co., LTD., Fukui, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Soya', 'firstname': 'Yoshihiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic System Department, TOYOBO Co., LTD., Fukui, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shimada', 'firstname': 'Akihiro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, University of Fukui Hospital, Fukui, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Iwano', 'firstname': 'Masayuki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kimura', 'firstname': 'Hideki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, University of Fukui Hospital, Fukui, Japan.

A retrospective analysis was performed on 3 cases of C. psittaci pneumonia admitted to People's Hospital of Tongling City from July 2019 to January 2020. The patients' contact history, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination, imaging characteristics and evolution, etiology, treatment process and outcome were analyzed, so as to provide experience for the diagnosis and prevention of C. psittaci pneumonia.
The 3 patients had been infected through pet or zoonotic exposures. All symptoms included high fever (body temperature > 39 centigrade), cough, sputum, chest tightness and dyspnea. The disease progressed rapidly, with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and shock as the main manifestations, but the damages to the heart, liver and kidney were mild. Laboratory tests showed that C-reactive protein (CRP, all > 200 mg/L) and neutrophil proportion (Neut%, > 0.90) were significantly increased, while white blood cell count (WBC) and procalcitonin (PCT) were not significantly increased. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed inflammatory infiltration with interstitial changes, either unilateral or bilateral. Chest X-ray showed large areas of inflammatory infiltrations, fan-shaped or wedge-shaped to the edge of pleura. After 7 days of treatment, the bedside computed X-ray (CR) showed absorption of infiltration. After 11-13 days, the CT reexamination indicated lung infection was basically absorbed. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) confirmed the presence of C. psittaci in patients' sputum. It was sensitive to quinolones and tetracyclines. The patients' body temperature dropped to normal after 2-3 days of antibiotics, and all patients were extubated and transferred to normal ward 10 days later. The total course of illness was 20-30 days.
The patients with C. psittaci pneumonia are critically ill, and clinical manifestations of moderate to severe ARDS and shock are common.

33829216,Epidemiology of Marginal Zone Lymphoma.,Annals of lymphoma,"In 2016 there were an estimated 7,460 newly diagnosed patients with marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) in the US, which comprised 7% of all mature non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Based on data from the US SEER-18 program from 2001-2017, the age-standardized incidence rate for MZL was 19.6 per 1,000,000 person-years; 9% of MZL cases were splenic MZL (SMZL), 30% nodal MZL (NMZL), and 61% extranodal MZL (EMZL) of mucusa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Incidence rates were slightly higher in men for SMZL and NMZL, but similar for EMZL, and increased steeply with age for all MZL subtypes. The incidence (age-standardized per 1,000,000) of MZL was highest among non-Hispanic whites (20.7), followed by Hispanics of all races (17.6), non-Hispanic blacks (15.4), and Asian/Pacific islanders (15.0). The incidence of MZL increased +1.0% per year in the US from 2001-2017, with increases reported in other countries during this timeframe. The 5-year relative survival rate for MZL in the US was 89.8% and was similar across racial/ethnic groups and by sex; survival rates have been increasing in the US and other countries. Established risk factors for MZL (or MZL subtypes) include family history of NHL, genetic loci in the HLA region, ",10.21037/aol-20-28,"[{'lastname': 'Cerhan', 'firstname': 'James R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905.'}, {'lastname': 'Habermann', 'firstname': 'Thomas M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905.'}]"

Fifty heifers calves were enrolled [38 Gyr (Zebu, Bos taurus indicus) and 12 5/8 Holstein x Gyr]. At 120 days of age, animals were randomly distributed among three groups: B (n = 18), vaccinated against brucellosis; C (n = 14), vaccinated against clostridia and CB (n = 18), vaccinated concomitantly for both. Rectal (RT) and thermographic temperatures were evaluated on days -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7,10, 14, and 28 relatives to the vaccination day. Feed and water intake, body weight (BW) and feeding behavior were monitored daily by an electronic feeding system. Blood was sampled on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28, relative to the vaccination day for determination of glucose (GLC) and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations. Blood sampled on day 0 (pre-vaccination) and on day 28 and 42 were used to evaluate the immune response against Brucella abortus and clostridia. There was an increase in rectal temperature between the first and the third day post-vaccination in the three groups. The thermography revealed an increase of local temperature for seven days on groups B and CB. Group C had increased local temperature for a longer period, lasting for up to 14 d. Dry mater intake was reduced for groups B and CB, but no alteration was observed for group C. No alterations regarding initial BW, final BW, average daily weight gain (ADG) and feed efficiency were observed. No differences were observed for the three vaccination groups for blood parameters throughout the evaluation period. The concomitant vaccination against brucellosis and clostridia led to lower neutralizing antibody titers against epsilon toxin of C. perfringens and botulinum toxin type C of C. botulinum (C > CB > B). When cellular proliferation assay and serological tests to B. abortus were evaluated, no differences were observed between groups B and CB. The present results indicate that the concomitant vaccination against brucellosis and clostridia has no relevant impact on the intake, performance, and feeding behavior of dairy calves.

33818953,Evaluation and Comparison of Clostridium Epsilon-Alpha Fusion Gene Expression Using Different Commercial Expression Vector.,Archives of Razi Institute,"Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium septicum are gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming rods and pathogens for humans and livestock, which are widespread in nature as well as human and animal digestive systems. C. perfringens produces numerous different exoproteins, which are various systems of action. The major C. perfringens toxins include alpha, beta, epsilon, and iota. C. perfringens are classified into five groups (A-E) on the basis of the production of these lethal toxins. Furthermore, toxins secreted from C. septicum include alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. Epsilon and alpha toxins of C. perfringens and C. septicum are the major causes of enterotoxemia and braxy in sheep and goats, respectively. The production of recombinant immunogenic proteins of these bacteria using suitable expression vectors and expression prokaryotic hosts can be a convenient method for the reduction of the costs and production time of clostridial anaerobic vaccines. In the present study, recombinant Escherichia coli strain TOP10 containing pJET&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; was used for the evaluation of C. perfringens type D and C. septicum epsilon-alpha fusion protein using different commercial vectors. After the extraction of pJET&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; from the recombinant cell, it was digested by NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and subcloned into pET22b (+), pET26b (+), and pGEM-B1 expression vectors in E. coli/Rosetta and E. coli/BL21 (DE3). The expression of recombinant fusion toxin was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting in three different temperatures, various isopropyl &amp;beta;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) gradients, and different times using pGEM&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha;, pET22&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha;, and pET26&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; vectors in E. coli/Rosetta and E. coli/BL21 (DE3). According to the obtained results, recombinant E. coli/Rosetta/pET22&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; showed better expression at a temperature of 37&amp;deg;C after 6 h of induction by IPTG.",10.22092/ari.2019.126604.1349,"[{'lastname': 'Sepehrifar', 'firstname': 'H R', 'initials': 'HR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Karaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Pilehchian Langroudi', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Clostridia Specialized Research Laboratory, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran.\nClostridia Specialized Research Laboratory, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Ataei', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Avian Bacterial Diseases, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Haddadi', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Karaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran.'}]"

Different wound swabs were taken from 140 patients. PCR was applied for detection of clostridial toxins; alpha toxin (cpa) gene, epsilon toxin (etx) gene, and iota toxin (iap) gene. Metronidazole nim gene, tetracycline resistance genes; (tetQ, tetM, tetB, and tetW) and clindamycin resistance genes erm (A,B), were used for genotypic detection of antibiotic resistance.
Out of 140 clinical samples collected, 7 isolates were detected using specific primer 16S-23S intergenic rRNA spacer gene of C. perfringens. Results showed presence of alpha toxin (cpa) genes in all clostridial isolates, Epsilon toxin (etx) genes in 2/7(28.4%), and iota toxin (iap) genes in 2/7 (28.4%). Results of antibiotic resistance genes showed that all isolates were not able to produce nim, tet W and Q, tet B, erm (A), erm (B) genes except for tetM. Gene sequence analysis for cpa gene showed that there were 3 mutations in the sample of this gene, the results of etx gene when had been sent 2 samples from this gene. The first sample showed that there was one mutation and the results of iap gene showed that there were no mutation in 2 samples of the iap gene. The samples had been showed identical 100%.

33818953,Evaluation and Comparison of Clostridium Epsilon-Alpha Fusion Gene Expression Using Different Commercial Expression Vector.,Archives of Razi Institute,"Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium septicum are gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming rods and pathogens for humans and livestock, which are widespread in nature as well as human and animal digestive systems. C. perfringens produces numerous different exoproteins, which are various systems of action. The major C. perfringens toxins include alpha, beta, epsilon, and iota. C. perfringens are classified into five groups (A-E) on the basis of the production of these lethal toxins. Furthermore, toxins secreted from C. septicum include alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. Epsilon and alpha toxins of C. perfringens and C. septicum are the major causes of enterotoxemia and braxy in sheep and goats, respectively. The production of recombinant immunogenic proteins of these bacteria using suitable expression vectors and expression prokaryotic hosts can be a convenient method for the reduction of the costs and production time of clostridial anaerobic vaccines. In the present study, recombinant Escherichia coli strain TOP10 containing pJET&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; was used for the evaluation of C. perfringens type D and C. septicum epsilon-alpha fusion protein using different commercial vectors. After the extraction of pJET&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; from the recombinant cell, it was digested by NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and subcloned into pET22b (+), pET26b (+), and pGEM-B1 expression vectors in E. coli/Rosetta and E. coli/BL21 (DE3). The expression of recombinant fusion toxin was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting in three different temperatures, various isopropyl &amp;beta;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) gradients, and different times using pGEM&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha;, pET22&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha;, and pET26&amp;epsilon;&amp;alpha; vectors in E. coli/Rosetta and E. coli/BL21 (DE3).

Different wound swabs were taken from 140 patients. PCR was applied for detection of clostridial toxins; alpha toxin (cpa) gene, epsilon toxin (etx) gene, and iota toxin (iap) gene. Metronidazole nim gene, tetracycline resistance genes; (tetQ, tetM, tetB, and tetW) and clindamycin resistance genes erm (A,B), were used for genotypic detection of antibiotic resistance.
Out of 140 clinical samples collected, 7 isolates were detected using specific primer 16S-23S intergenic rRNA spacer gene of C. perfringens. Results showed presence of alpha toxin (cpa) genes in all clostridial isolates, Epsilon toxin (etx) genes in 2/7(28.4%), and iota toxin (iap) genes in 2/7 (28.4%). Results of antibiotic resistance genes showed that all isolates were not able to produce nim, tet W and Q, tet B, erm (A), erm (B) genes except for tetM. Gene sequence analysis for cpa gene showed that there were 3 mutations in the sample of this gene, the results of etx gene when had been sent 2 samples from this gene. The first sample showed that there was one mutation and the results of iap gene showed that there were no mutation in 2 samples of the iap gene. The samples had been showed identical 100%.

Some of these pathogens can cause severe diseases in humans, including anaplasmosis, rickettsioses, and ehrlichiosis. Previous studies in South Korea have investigated tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) residing in ticks found on grassy vegetation and animals. However, there is limited phylogenetic information on TBPs in ticks parasitizing Korean water deer (KWD; Hydropotes inermis argyropus). This study evaluated the prevalence, risk factors (regions, tick stages, and tick species), and coinfections of TBPs in ticks parasitizing KWD. Were collected a total of 283 hard ticks, including Haemaphysalis longicornis, Haemaphysalis flava, and Ixodes nipponensis from KWD in South Korea from 2013 to 2017. In 173 tested tick pools, genes for seven TBPs, namely Rickettsia raoultii (20 %), Rickettsia tamurae (1 %), Candidatus Rickettsia longicornii (31 %), Ehrlichia canis (3 %), Anaplasma capra (3 %), Anaplasma bovis (2 %), and Anaplasma sp. (1 %), were detected. The unidentified Anaplasma sp. isolates revealed a 98.4 %-99.3 % sequence identity with Anaplasma sp. in GenBank sequences obtained from ticks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the presence of the emerging human pathogen R. tamurae in South Korea.

Feeding primarily on dogs, members of the complex also feed incidentally on humans, potentially transmitting disease agents such as Rickettsia rickettsii, R. conorii, and Ehrlichia species. There are two genetic Rh. sanguineus lineages in North America, designated as the temperate and tropical lineages, which had occurred in discrete locations, although there is now range overlap in parts of California and Arizona. Rh. sanguineus in Europe are reportedly more aggressive toward humans during hot weather, increasing the risk of pathogen transmission to humans. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of hot weather on choice between humans and dog hosts among tropical and temperate lineage Rh. sanguineus individuals. Ticks in a two-choice olfactometer migrated toward a dog or human in trials at room (23.5°C) or high temperature (38°C). At 38°C, 2.5 times more tropical lineage adults chose humans compared with room temperature, whereas temperate lineage adults demonstrated a 66% reduction in preference for dogs and a slight increase in preference for humans. Fewer nymphs chose either host at 38°C than at room temperature in both lineages. These results demonstrate that risk of disease transmission to humans may be increased during periods of hot weather, where either lineage is present, and that hot weather events associated with climatic change may result in more frequent rickettsial disease outbreaks.",10.4269/ajtmh.20-1376,"[{'lastname': 'Backus', 'firstname': 'Laura H', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'López Pérez', 'firstname': 'Andrés M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Foley', 'firstname': 'Janet E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': None}]"

33836064,Crystal structure and functional implication of a bacterial cyclic AMP-AMP-GMP synthetase.,Nucleic acids research,"Mammalian cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its homologue dinucleotide cyclase in Vibrio cholerae (VcDncV) produce cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) that participate in the defense against viral infection. Recently, scores of new cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases (CD-NTases) were discovered, which produce various CDNs and cyclic trinucleotides (CTNs) as second messengers. Here, we present the crystal structures of EcCdnD, a CD-NTase from Enterobacter cloacae that produces cyclic AMP-AMP-GMP, in its apo-form and in complex with ATP, ADP and AMPcPP, an ATP analogue. Despite the similar overall architecture, the protein shows significant structural variations from other CD-NTases. Adjacent to the donor substrate, another nucleotide is bound to the acceptor binding site by a non-productive mode. Isothermal titration calorimetry results also suggest the presence of two ATP binding sites. GTP alone does not bind to EcCdnD, which however binds to pppApG, a possible intermediate. The enzyme is active on ATP or a mixture of ATP and GTP, and the best metal cofactor is Mg2+. The conserved residues Asp69 and Asp71 are essential for catalysis, as indicated by the loss of activity in the mutants. Based on structural analysis and comparison with VcDncV and RNA polymerase, a tentative catalytic pathway for the CTN-producing EcCdnD is proposed.",10.1093/nar/gkab165,"[{'lastname': 'Ko', 'firstname': 'Tzu-Ping', 'initials': 'TP', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yu-Chuan', 'initials': 'YC', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsai', 'firstname': 'Chia-Ling', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Chia-Shin', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hou', 'firstname': 'Mei-Hui', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yeh', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Institute of New Drug Development, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.\nResearch Center for Cancer Biology, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.\nNew Drug Development Center, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.'}]"

33796488,Factors Associated With MALDI-TOF Mass Spectral Quality of Species Identification in Clinical Routine Diagnostics.,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,"An accurate and timely identification of bacterial species is critical in clinical diagnostics. Species identification allows a potential first adaptation of empiric antibiotic treatments before the resistance profile is available. Matrix assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a widely used method for bacterial species identification. However, important challenges in species identification remain. These arise from (i) incomplete databases, (ii) close relatedness of species of interest, and (iii) spectral quality, which is currently vaguely defined.
We selected 47 clinically relevant bacterial isolates from 39 species, which can be challenging to identify by MALDI-TOF MS. We measured these isolates under various analytical conditions on two MALDI-TOF MS systems. First, we identified spectral features, which were associated with correct species identification in three different databases. Considering these features, we then systematically compared spectra produced with three different sample preparation protocols. In addition, we varied quantities of bacterial colony material applied and bacterial colony age.
We identified (i) the number of ribosomal marker peaks detected, (ii) the median relative intensity of ribosomal marker peaks, (iii) the sum of the intensity of all detected peaks, (iv) a high measurement precision, and (v) reproducibility of peaks to act as good proxies of spectral quality. We found that using formic acid, measuring bacterial colonies at a young age, and frequently calibrating the MALDI-TOF MS device increase mass spectral quality. We further observed significant differences in spectral quality between different bacterial taxa and optimal measurement conditions vary per taxon.
We identified and applied quality measures for MALDI-TOF MS and optimized spectral quality in routine settings. Phylogenetic marker peaks can be reproducibly detected and provide an increased resolution and the ability to distinguish between challenging species such as those within the ",10.3389/fcimb.2021.646648,"[{'lastname': 'Cuénod', 'firstname': 'Aline', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Applied Microbiology Research, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.\nDivision of Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Foucault', 'firstname': 'Frédéric', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Mabritec AG, Riehen, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pflüger', 'firstname': 'Valentin', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Mabritec AG, Riehen, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Egli', 'firstname': 'Adrian', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Applied Microbiology Research, Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.\nDivision of Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}]"

33830615,"Temperature Regulation of Membrane Composition in the Firmicute, Enterococcus faecalis, Parallels That of Escherichia coli.",Environmental microbiology,"Both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli can undergo abrupt temperature transitions in nature. E. coli changes the composition of its phospholipid acyl chains in response to shifts growth temperature. This is mediated by a naturally temperature sensitive enzyme, FabF (3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase II), that elongates the 16 carbon unsaturated acyl chain palmitoleate to the 18 carbon unsaturated acyl chain, cis-vaccenate. FabF is more active at low temperatures resulting in increased incorporation of cis-vaccenoyl acyl chains into the membrane phospholipids. This response to temperature is an intrinsic property of FabF and does not require increased synthesis of the enzyme. We report that the FabF of the very divergent bacterium, E. faecalis, has properties very similar to E. coli FabF and is responsible for changing E. faecalis membrane phospholipid acyl chain composition in response to temperature. Moreover, expression E. faecalis FabF in an E. coli ∆fabF strain restores temperature regulation to the E. coli strain. This article is protected by copyright.

The potential bactericidal rates for SDF, PI and SDF + PI against E. faecalis, A. naeslundii and P. micra were calculated as reduction of bacteria colony forming units.
The bactericidal potential of SDF was at 99.97-100% against E. faecalis and 100% against A. naeslundii and P. micra. SDF + PI showed a 100% bactericidal effect against P. micra, 99.89-99.98% against E. faecalis and 99.98-100% against A. naeslundii. The bactericidal effect of PI was 99.51-99.98% against E. faecalis, 99.27-99.95% against A. naeslundii and 99.93-100% against P. micra. The differences between controls and bacteria exposed to the antibacterial agents were statistically significant (p < 0.05).
SDF had an effective bactericidal effect against the examined bacteria. However, the limitations of this in vitro study do not allow a recommendation of the employment of these solutions as root canal irrigants.

The ectoparasitic Varroa destructor mite put threats on the honey bee industry. A Varroa toxic protein (VTP) from the saliva of Varroa mites contributes to the toxicity toward Apis cerana and the deformed wing virus elevation in Apis mellifera. However, the immune response and hemolymph microbiota of honey bee species after the injection of recombinant VTP has not yet been reported. In this study, both A. cerana and A. mellifera worker larvae were injected with the recombinant VTP. Then the expressions of the honey bee immune genes abaecin, defensin, and domeless at three time points were determined by qRT-PCR, and hemolymph microbial community were analyzed by culture-dependent method, after recombinant VTP injection. The mortality rates of A. cerana larvae were much higher than those of A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. VTP injection induced the upregulation of defensin gene expression in A. mellifera larvae, and higher levels of abaecin and domeless mRNAs response in A. cerana larvae, compared with the control (without any injection). Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injection also upregulated the expression levels of abaecin, defensin, and domeless in A. mellifera and A. cerana larvae. Three bacterial species (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus cohnii, and Bacillus cereus) were isolated from the hemolymph of A. cerana larvae after VTP injection and at 48 h after PBS injections. Two bacterial species (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus) were isolated from A. mellifera larvae after VTP challenge. No bacterial colonies were detected from the larval hemolymph of both honey bee species treated by injection only and the control. The result indicates that abaecin, defensin, and domeless genes and hemolymph microbiota respond to the VTP challenge. VTP injection might induce the dramatic growth of different bacterial species in the hemolymph of the injected larvae of A. mellifera and A. cerana, which provide cues for further studying the interactions among the honey bee, VTP, and hemolymph bacteria.",10.1093/jee/toab047,"[{'lastname': 'Balakrishnan', 'firstname': 'Balachandar', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Hua', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Wenfeng', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Richou', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Animal Conservation and Resource Utilization, Guangdong Public Laboratory of Wild Animal Conservation and Utilization, Institute of Zoology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510260, Guangdong, China.'}]"
33835078,Influence of Proton Pump Inhibitors and Histamine Receptor 2 Antagonists on Blastocystis ST3 and Selected Microorganisms of Intestinal Microbiota In Vitro.,Clinical and translational gastroenterology,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine receptor 2 (H2) antagonists are commonly prescribed medications. Association between PPIs and alteration of the gut microbiota has been reported. Blastocystis, the most common intestinal protozoan worldwide, occurs in both healthy and symptomatic people with gastrointestinal or cutaneous disorders, with controversial pathogenicity. The current study was aimed to investigate the influence of PPIs and H2 blockers on the in vitro proliferation of selected intestinal bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.
Cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Candida albicans, and Blastocystis subtype 3 were treated with different concentrations of respective medications in vitro, and the numbers of microorganisms were quantified and compared.
Pantoprazole and esomeprazole exerted a significant inhibition on Blastocystis and C. albicans, especially at higher concentrations, which were even more effective than metronidazole. On the other hand, treatment with pantoprazole caused an increase in proliferation of L. rhamnosus and E. coli. There was no influence of H2 blockers on the examined microorganisms.
PPIs, such as pantoprazole, can be a potential treatment in the prophylaxis or eradication of Blastocystis and C. albicans.",10.14309/ctg.0000000000000325,"[{'lastname': 'Lepczyńska', 'firstname': 'Małgorzata', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dzika', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Żołnierska, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'WenChieh', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Chien-Yu', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}]"

To control hospital-associated infections, skin antisepsis and bathing utilizing chlorhexidine is recommended for VRE patients in acute care hospitals. Previously, we reported that exposure to inhibitory chlorhexidine levels induced the expression of vancomycin resistance genes in VanA-type Enterococcus faecium. However, vancomycin susceptibility actually increased for VanA-type E. faecium in the presence of chlorhexidine. Hence, a synergistic effect of the two antimicrobials was observed. In this study, we used multiple approaches to investigate the mechanism of synergism between chlorhexidine and vancomycin in the VanA-type VRE strain E. faecium 1,231,410. We generated clean deletions of 7 of 11 pbp, transpeptidase, and carboxypeptidase genes in this strain (ponA, pbpF, pbpZ, pbpA, ddcP, ldtfm, and vanY). Deletion of ddcP, encoding a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase, altered the synergism phenotype. Furthermore, using in vitro evolution, we isolated a spontaneous synergy escaper mutant and utilized whole genome sequencing to determine that a mutation in pstB, encoding an ATPase of phosphate-specific transporters, also altered synergism. Finally, addition of excess D-lactate, but not D-alanine, enhanced synergism to reduce vancomycin MIC levels.

33822062,Emergence of aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia-positive enterococci with non-high-level gentamicin resistance mediated by IS1216V: adaptation to decreased aminoglycoside usage in Taiwan.,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,"To explore the mechanisms mediating the different levels of gentamicin resistance in enterococci.
Susceptibility testing with gentamicin and PCR of resistance determinants were performed in 149 enterococcal isolates. Genetic relatedness was characterized by MLST and PFGE analysis. Sequences of the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia gene and its surrounding environment were determined by Illumina sequencing. Stability assays of gentamicin resistance were carried out to evaluate the probability of loss of the high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) phenotype.
A total of 17 (11.4%) aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia-positive enterococcal isolates (2 Enterococcus faecalis and 15 Enterococcus faecium) with non-HLGR phenotype were found. MLST analysis revealed that the 2 E. faecalis belonged to ST116 and ST618, while all the 15 E. faecium belonged to clonal complex 17. Sequence analysis demonstrated that IS1216V was inserted into the 5'-end of aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, leading to loss of HLGR phenotype. Three IS1216V insertion types were found, and type II and III were frequently found in E. faecium. Interestingly, a total of 38 aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia-positive E. faecium with HLGR phenotype also had type II or type III IS1216V insertion. Sequencing of the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia-positive HLGR E. faecium E37 revealed that an intact aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia was located adjacent to IS1216V-disrupted aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia. In a non-antibiotic environment, E37 tended to lose HLGR phenotype with a probability of 1.57 × 10-4, which was largely attributed to homologous recombination between the intact and disrupted aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia.
This is first study to elucidate that the E. faecium is capable of changing its HLGR phenotype, which may contribute to adaptation to hospital environments with decreased usage of gentamicin.",10.1093/jac/dkab071,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'You-Han', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Shang-Yi', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Yu-Tzu', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tseng', 'firstname': 'Sung-Pin', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nDrug Development and Value Creation Research Center, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Chen-Chia', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Song-Yih', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hung', 'firstname': 'Wei-Wen', 'initials': 'WW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Endocrine and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Jao', 'firstname': 'Ya-Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Infection Control Center, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Chun-Yu', 'initials': 'CY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nInfection Control Center, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yen-Hsu', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nSchool of Medicine, Graduate Institute of Medicine, Sepsis Research Center, Center of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Biological Science and Technology, College of Biological Science and Technology, National Chiao Tung University, HsinChu, Taiwan.\nInstitute of Medical Science and Technology, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hung', 'firstname': 'Wei-Chun', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}]"

Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) has particularly an incredible clinical significance, as a critical carcinogenic agent for humans. Several strategies have been implemented for lowering the AFM1 amount, such as the employment of probiotics, particularly lactobacilli or lactic acid bacteria (LAB). However, this strategy has not been applied routinely until today. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of three LABs on the reduction of AFM1 in traditional milk and cheese samples. In total, 85 milk (n=45) and cheese (n=40) samples were obtained from the open markets of Shiraz, Iran, from February to June 2018. Additionally, the AFM1 levels were evaluated, compared to those of the National Iranian Standard. The data were then analyzed in SPSS software (version 20) through the Chi-square test. Statistical analysis was performed at a 95% confidence level (p-value of &amp;lt;0.00001). Out of 50 purchased LABs, the efficient antifungal property and resistance to bile salts were observed in five strains. The mean value of these five strains was calculated after adding 5 ppm AFM1, compared to natamycin. The strains with a reduction in AFM1 level were sequenced and registered in the NCBI database.In total, 15 samples with contamination higher than the allowed limit included Penicillium spp, Aspergillus niger, Saccharomyces cerevisia, Saccharomyces paradoxus, and Yarrowia lipolytica.The results also showed reduced AFM1 levels in three LAB-treated strains. Lactobacillus fermentum CECT562 (T), Lactobacillus brevis ATCC14869 (T), and Enterococcus faecium LMG 11423 (T) had this capability to 0.05, 0.03, and 0.03 respectively. The National Iranian Standard should be implemented to have control over traditional dairy products with more care.

33836048,An Overview of Traceback Investigations and Three Case Studies of Recent Outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7 Infections Linked to Romaine Lettuce.,Journal of food protection,"Leafy greens contaminated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) have continued to cause foodborne illness outbreaks in recent years and present a threat to public health. An important component of foodborne illness outbreak investigations is determining the source of the outbreak vehicle through traceback investigations. The Food and Drug Administration is home to traceback investigation experts that employ a standardized process to initiate, execute, and interpret the results of traceback investigations in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local partners. Traceback investigations of three outbreaks of STEC infections linked to romaine lettuce in 2018 and 2019 were examined to demonstrate challenges, limitations, and opportunities for improvement. The three outbreaks resulted in a total of 474 illnesses, 215 hospitalizations, and five deaths. These illnesses were linked to the consumption of romaine lettuce from three distinct growing regions in Arizona and California. Some of the challenges encountered included the time it took to initiate a traceback, limited product-identifying information throughout the supply chain, lack of interoperability in record keeping systems, and co-mingling of product from multiple suppliers. These challenges led to time delays in the identification of the farm source of the leafy greens and the inability to identify the root cause of contamination. Implementation of technology enabled traceability systems, testing of these systems, and future regulations to incentivize adoption of traceability systems are some of the initiatives that will help address these challenges by improving traceback investigations and ultimately preventing foodborne illnesses and future outbreaks from occurring.",10.4315/JFP-21-112,"[{'lastname': 'Irvin', 'firstname': 'Kari', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'US Food and Drug Administration CFSAN 4300 River Rd.

33835673,Biochar as a biocompatible mild anti-inflammatory supplement for animal feed and agricultural fields.,Chemistry & biodiversity,"Biochar is an organic material and high in carbon content, besides its use for energy purposes, it is also a material that serves the purpose of improving soil fertility, organic matter content of soils and removing heavy metals from water and soil. This study aims to investigate the antimicrobial effects of biochar whose beneficial effects on agricultural productivity has been proven by different studies. Scientific literature concerning the antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral effects of the apricot seed and olive seed biochar is limited. Biochar applications may help to alter the microbial diversity by modifying biological environment either in agriculture or in animal husbandry. Moreover, biochar has been used in animal husbandry to improve animal health especially by regulating the intestinal flora and inflammation in the intestines. Hence, in our study, we investigated the effect of biochar on the growth of Aspergillus niger, Cryphonectria parasitica, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Plenodomus tracheiphilus, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and two different bacteriophage strains. Biochar did not have a direct effect on the growth of neither Gram positive nor Gram negative bacteria, bacteriophages and fungi. In order to test their direct effects on the immune cells, mammalian macrophages were used and biochar directly reduced the inflammatory cytokine levels produced by the in vitro activated macrophages.",10.1002/cbdv.202001002,"[{'lastname': 'Yıldızlı', 'firstname': 'Gizem', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Mersin University: Mersin Universitesi, Biotechnology, Mersin Uni.

33828891,Abdominal Variant of Lemierre's Syndrome in a Patient with Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.,Medeniyet medical journal,"Lemierre's syndrome is an illness characterized by internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis related to infectious agents, primarily Fusobacterium necrophorum. These bacteria, residing in both the oropharynx and the gastrointestinal tract, may lead to pylephlebitis, a serious condition that could result in the development of hepatic abscesses. This manifestation of the disease is regarded as the abdominal variant of Lemierre's syndrome. Patients with gastrointestinal malignancies, especially those who undergo surgeries, are susceptible to the abdominal variant of Lemierre's syndrome. Timely diagnosis is required to avoid the life-threatening complications of the abdominal variant of Lemierre's syndrome. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be very useful in differentiating this disease from liver metastasis in patients with malignancies. Radiologists and clinicians need to be aware of this challenging condition to prevent misdiagnosis, since prompt treatment is often lifesaving.

33757851,Geographical differences in tonsillar carriage rates of Fusobacterium necrophorum - A cross-sectional study in Sweden and Zambia.,Anaerobe,"While Fusobacterium necrophorum historically has been considered normal tonsillar flora, recent studies from Europe and the US have suggested that carriage occur transiently in adolescence and young adulthood. However, no studies originating from Africa exist. In this cross-sectional study of tonsillar carriage of F. necrophorum, we aimed to investigate geographical differences in tonsillar carriage rates of F. necrophorum in healthy participants aged 15-25 years in Sweden and Zambia and further investigate the age distribution of tonsillar carriage in Zambia. Specimens were obtained by tonsillar swabs and analyzed with real-time PCR for F. necrophorum. In participants aged 15-25 years, tonsillar carriage was more common in Sweden 21/100 (21%) than in Zambia 6/192 (3%), p < 0.001. In Zambian participants aged above 25 years tonsillar carriage was rare 1/76 (1%). In conclusion, the high rate of tonsillar carriage in participants aged 15-25 years in Sweden has implications on the interpretation of tonsillar findings in patients with pharyngotonsillitis. Interestingly, a geographical difference was found with tonsillar carriage rarely identified in Zambia.",10.1016/j.anaerobe.2021.102360,"[{'lastname': 'Nygren', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Division of Infection Medicine, Department for Clinical Sciences Lund, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.

33693672,Bacterial community analysis of purulent material from liver abscesses of crossbred cattle and Holstein steers fed finishing diets with or without tylosin.,Journal of animal science,"Liver abscesses in feedlot cattle are polymicrobial infections. Culture-based studies have identified Fusobacterium necrophorum as the primary causative agent, but a number of other bacterial species are frequently isolated. The incidence of liver abscesses is highly variable and is affected by a number of factors, including cattle type. Holstein steers raised for beef production have a higher incidence than crossbred feedlot cattle. Tylosin is the commonly used antimicrobial feed additive to reduce the incidence of liver abscesses. The objective of this study was to utilize 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequence analyses to analyze the bacterial community composition of purulent material of liver abscesses of crossbred cattle (n=24) and Holstein steers (n=24), each fed finishing diet with or without tylosin. DNA was extracted and the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified, sequenced and analyzed. The minimum, mean, and maximum sequence reads per sample were 996, 177,070, and 877,770, respectively, across all the liver abscess samples. Sequence analyses identified five phyla, 14 families, 98 genera and 102 amplicon sequence variants (ASV) in the four treatment groups. The dominant phyla identified were Fusobacteria (52% of total reads) and Proteobacteria (33%). Of the top 25 genera identified, 17 genera were Gram negative and 8 were Gram positive. The top three genera, which accounted for 75% of the total reads, in the order of abundance, were Fusobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides. The relative abundance, expressed as percent of total reads, of phyla, family and genera did not differ (P > 0.05) between the four treatment groups. Generic richness and evenness, determined by Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's diversity indices, respectively, did not differ between the groups. The UniFrac distance matrices data revealed no clustering of the ASV indicating variance between the samples within each treatment group. Co-occurrence network analysis at the genus level indicated a strong association of Fusobacterium with 15 other genera, and not all of them have been previously isolated from liver abscesses. In conclusion, the culture-independent method identified the bacterial composition of liver abscesses as predominantly Gram negative and Fusobacterium as the dominant genus, followed by Pseudomonas. The bacterial community composition did not differ between crossbred and Holstein steers fed finishing diets with or without tylosin.",10.1093/jas/skab076,"[{'lastname': 'Amachawadi', 'firstname': 'Raghavendra G', 'initials': 'RG', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Clinical Sciences, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tom', 'firstname': 'Wesley A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hays', 'firstname': 'Michael P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernando', 'firstname': 'Samodha C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Science, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hardwidge', 'firstname': 'Philip R', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nagaraja', 'firstname': 'T G', 'initials': 'TG', 'affiliation': 'Diagnostic Medicine/Pathobiology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas, USA.'}]"

The objective of the study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with 14-day mortality for patients with bacteremia due to OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae.We conducted a retrospective, single-center observational study of adult patients with K. pneumoniae bacteremia, classifying the strains as carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKp) and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKp). All of the CRKp strains were the OXA-48-type.The study included 202 cases of bacteremia: 114 due to CSKp and 88 due to CRKp. The clinical cure rate was higher for the patients with CSKp (85% vs 69% for CSKp and CRKp, respectively; P = .010), while the 14-day mortality rate was lower (13% vs 30%, P = .005).

33831764,Deciphering the black box of microbial community of common effluent treatment plant through integrated metagenomics: Tackling industrial effluent.,Journal of environmental management,"Identifying the microbial community and their functional potential from different stages of common effluent treatment plants (CETP) can enhance the efficiency of wastewater treatment systems. In this study, wastewater metagenomes from 8 stages of CETP were screened for microbial diversity and gene profiling along with their corresponding degradation activities. The microbial community displayed 98.46% of bacterial species, followed by Eukarya (0.10%) and Archaea 0.02%. At the Phylum level, Proteobacteria (28.8%) was dominant, followed by Bacteroidetes (16.1%), Firmicutes (11.7%), and Fusobacteria (6.9%) which are mainly capable of degrading the aromatic compounds. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Wolinella succinogenes, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, and Clostridium sticklandii were the most prevalent species. The functional analysis further demonstrated the presence of enzymes linked with genes/pathways known to be involved in the degradation/metabolization of aromatic compounds like benzoate, bisphenol, 1,2-dichloroethane phenylalanine. This information was further validated with the whole genome analysis of the bacteria isolated from the CETP. We anticipate that integrating both shotgun and whole-genome analyses can reveal the rich reservoir for novel enzymes and genes present in CETP effluent that can contribute to designing efficient bioremediation strategies for the environment in general CETP system, in particular.",10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112448,"[{'lastname': 'Pandit', 'firstname': 'Priti Raj', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Raghawendra', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Dinesh', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Zarna', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Pandya', 'firstname': 'Labdhi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology (DST), 6th Floor, MS Building, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382011, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Manish', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Discipline of Earth Sciences, IIT Gandhinagar, Gujarat, 382355, India.

33818451,Role of IL-17 gene polymorphism in Indian kala-azar.,Journal of vector borne diseases,"Visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar is a fatal protozoan disease caused by an obligate intracellular parasite, Leishmania donovani. Susceptibility, establishment of infection and severity of this disease depend upon many factors, but it is the host immune system that plays decisive role in disease progression. Keeping this view into consideration, we investigated the probable relationship between polymorphisms rs2275913 and rs8193036 in IL-17 gene, and its association as a risk factor for kala-azar in an endemic population of Assam, India.
A total of 209 subjects, 76 kala-azar cases (male: 46, female: 30, mean age ± SD: 34.60 ± 12.61) and 133 controls (male: 66, female: 67, mean age ± SD: 33.35 ± 14.48) were included in this study. We analysed the polymorphisms, rs2275913 and rs8193036 by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. The data were analysed using logistic regression analysis and SPSS software.
The results revealed that the mutant rs8193036 TT genotype conferred 4.7-fold higher risk for kala-azar (p = 0.00991, OR = 4.72, 95% CI = 1.330-16.911). A significant difference was found between the allele frequencies of rs8193036 (p = 0.029, OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.04-2.57) when comparisons were done using the genetic models of association. When stratification analysis was done on the basis of active and past cases we found that during active infection rs2275913 A allele was significantly associated with increased risk of kala-azar (p = 0.016, OR = 3.95, 95% CI = 1.21-12.87).
The findings revealed that IL-17 genetic variant, rs8193036 is an independent risk factor for kala-azar infection and may contribute in pathogenesis of the disease. Further, rs2275913 polymorphism of IL-17 gene is associated with kala-azar during active infection.",10.4103/0972-9062.308795,"[{'lastname': 'Khatonier', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Northeastern Region, Dibrugarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Khan', 'firstname': 'A M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Northeastern Region, Dibrugarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sarmah', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Northeastern Region, Dibrugarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahmed', 'firstname': 'G U', 'initials': 'GU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biotechnology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, India.'}]"
33817826,Targeting sterol alpha-14 demethylase of Leishmania donovani to fight against leishmaniasis.,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania. It is endemic in more than 89 different countries worldwide. Sterol alpha-14 demethylase (LdSDM), a sterol biosynthetic pathway enzyme in Leishmania donovani, plays an essential role in parasite survival and proliferation. Here, we used a drug repurposing approach to virtually screen the library of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs against LdSDM to identify the potential lead-drug against leishmaniasis. Zafirlukast and avodart showed the best binding with LdSDM. Zafirlukast was tested for in vitro antileishmanial assay, but no significant effect on L. donovani promastigotes was observed even at higher concentrations. On the other hand, avodart profoundly inhibited parasite growth at relatively lower concentrations. Further, avodart showed a significant decrease in the number of intra-macrophagic amastigotes. Avodart-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the parasites in a dose-dependent manner. ROS induced by avodart led to the induction of apoptosis-like cell death in the parasites as observed through annexin V/PI staining. Here, for the first time, we reported the antileishmanial activity and its possible mechanism of action of FDA-approved drug, avodart, establishing a nice example of the drug-repurposing approach. Our study suggested the possible use of avodart as an effective antileishmanial agent after further detailed validations.",10.1002/jcb.29922,"[{'lastname': 'Tabrez', 'firstname': 'Shams', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Infection and Immunity Lab (414), Department of Biotechnology, Jamia Millia Islamia (A Central University), Delhi, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Rahman', 'firstname': 'Fazlur', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Infection and Immunity Lab (414), Department of Biotechnology, Jamia Millia Islamia (A Central University), Delhi, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ali', 'firstname': 'Rahat', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Infection and Immunity Lab (414), Department of Biotechnology, Jamia Millia Islamia (A Central University), Delhi, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Akand', 'firstname': 'Sajjadul Kadir', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Infection and Immunity Lab (414), Department of Biotechnology, Jamia Millia Islamia (A Central University), Delhi, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Alaidarous', 'firstname': 'Mohammed A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Majmaah University, Al Majmaah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nHealth and Basic Sciences Research Center, Majmaah University, Al Majmaah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Alshehri', 'firstname': 'Bader Mohammed', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Majmaah University, Al Majmaah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Banawas', 'firstname': 'Saeed', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Majmaah University, Al Majmaah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nHealth and Basic Sciences Research Center, Majmaah University, Al Majmaah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dukhyil', 'firstname': 'Abdul Aziz Bin', 'initials': 'AAB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Majmaah University, Al Majmaah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nHealth and Basic Sciences Research Center, Majmaah University, Al Majmaah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rub', 'firstname': 'Abdur', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Infection and Immunity Lab (414), Department of Biotechnology, Jamia Millia Islamia (A Central University), Delhi, New Delhi, India.'}]"

33246243,"Leptospira strains isolated from cattle in the Amazon region, Brazil, evidence of a variety of species and serogroups with a high frequency of the Sejroe serogroup.","Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases","In Brazil, there have been few leptospires isolated from cattle, especially in the Amazon, implying that the epidemiology of the disease in this region is still largely unclear. In a previous study, 52 Leptospira isolates were obtained from urine of cattle raised in the Brazilian Amazon and, to achieve a greater understanding of Leptospira infection in cattle of this region, the present study aimed to serologically and molecularly characterizes all these isolates. The laboratory assays used were the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) adopting a panel of polyclonal antisera against Leptospira spp. for serogrouping the isolates, DNA sequencing (secY) and multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). The isolates belonged to five species: 20/52 were identified as L. borgpetersenii (38.5 %); 18/52 as L. kirschneri (34.6 %); 9/52 as L. santarosai (17.3 %); 3/52 as L. noguchii (5.8 %) and 2/52 as L. interrogans (3.8 %). With serogrouping, nine different serogroups were detected, with a high frequency of the Sejroe serogroup. MLVA showed that all L. borgpetersenii isolates had a profile compatible with serovar Hardjo; moreover, the other isolates demonstrated a diversity of patterns, and some of them may represent strains not yet characterized. In the Brazilian Amazon, the leptospires circulating in cattle revealed the unique aspects of infections in this area which, in addition to a variety of strains, were characterized by a high frequency of the Sejroe serogroup, highlighting the serovar Hardjo, which has not been reported in other regions of Brazil.",10.1016/j.cimid.2020.101579,"[{'lastname': 'Guedes', 'firstname': 'Israel Barbosa', 'initials': 'IB', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Zoonoses Bacterianas, Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Souza', 'firstname': 'Gisele Oliveira de', 'initials': 'GO', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Zoonoses Bacterianas, Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Rocha', 'firstname': 'Katarine de Souza', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Zoonoses e Saúde Pública, Instituto de Medicina Veterinária, Universidade Federal do Pará, Castanhal, PA, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Cavalini', 'firstname': 'Matheus Burilli', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Zoonoses Bacterianas, Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Damasceno Neto', 'firstname': 'Manoel Soares', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência Animal, Universidade Federal do Pará, Castanhal, PA, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Castro', 'firstname': 'Juliana Fernandes de Paula', 'initials': 'JFP', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Zoonoses Bacterianas, Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Souza Filho', 'firstname': 'Antônio Francisco de', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Zoonoses Bacterianas, Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Negrão', 'firstname': 'Manoel Pierre', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Zoonoses e Saúde Pública, Instituto de Medicina Veterinária, Universidade Federal do Pará, Castanhal, PA, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Cortez', 'firstname': 'Adriana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Curso de Medicina Veterinária, Universidade Santo Amaro, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Moraes', 'firstname': 'Carla Cristina Guimarães de', 'initials': 'CCG', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Zoonoses e Saúde Pública, Instituto de Medicina Veterinária, Universidade Federal do Pará, Castanhal, PA, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Heinemann', 'firstname': 'Marcos Bryan', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Laboratório de Zoonoses Bacterianas, Departamento de Medicina Veterinária Preventiva e Saúde Animal, Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia, Universidade de São Paulo, São Paulo, SP, Brazil.

33836031,Immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of Ugandan adults who resist versus those who develop latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.,PloS one,"The search for immune correlates of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in humans is limited by the focus on peripheral blood measures. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can safely be done and provides insight into cellular function in the lung where infection is first established. In this study, blood and lung samples were assayed to determine if heavily MTB exposed persons who resist development of latent MTB infection (RSTR) vs those who develop latent MTB infection (LTBI), differ in the make-up of resident BAL innate and adaptive immune cells.
Bronchoscopy was performed on 21 healthy long-term Ugandan RSTR and 25 LTBI participants. Immune cell distributions in BAL and peripheral blood were compared by differential cell counting and flow cytometry.
The bronchoscopy procedure was well tolerated with few adverse reactions. Differential macrophage and lymphocyte frequencies in BAL differed between RSTR and LTBI. When corrected for age, this difference lost statistical significance. BAL CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were almost entirely composed of effector memory T cells in contrast to PBMC, and did not differ between RSTR and LTBI. BAL NKT, γδ T cells and NK cells also did not differ between RTSR and LTBI participants. There was a marginally significant increase (p = 0.034) in CD8 T effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) in PBMC of LTBI vs RSTR participants.
This observational case-control study comparing unstimulated BAL from RSTR vs LTBI, did not find evidence of large differences in the distribution of baseline BAL immune cells. PBMC TEMRA cell percentage was higher in LTBI relative to RSTR suggesting a role in the maintenance of latent MTB infection. Functional immune studies are required to determine if and how RSTR and LTBI BAL immune cells differ in response to MTB.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249477,"[{'lastname': 'Thiel', 'firstname': 'Bonnie A',

33834319,Affinity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains for M059K microglial cells after migration through A549 alveolar epithelium.,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat worldwide while central nervous system TB (CNS-TB) is one of the most severe forms of extrapulmonary TB. CNS-TB develops as a secondary infection during the hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) from the lungs to the CNS. Factors influencing the dissemination of the bacilli to the CNS have not been studied extensively. This study evaluated the transmigration ability through the alveolar epithelium and adhesion and invasion capacity of glial cells of M. tuberculosis strains of varying drug susceptibility and genotype profiles using an in vitro co-culture model. A549 alveolar epithelial cells and M059K glial cells were co-cultured in a Transwell plate with A549 cells cultured in the upper chamber and M059K glial cells in the lower chamber. A549 epithelial cells were infected with F15/LAM4/KZN (susceptible, MDR, XDR), Beijing (susceptible, XDR), F11 (susceptible), F28 (MDR), and H37Rv strains of M. tuberculosis. The transmigration of an A549 monolayer and subsequent adhesion and invasion rates of M059K cells were established. The susceptible and XDR variants of the F15/LAM4/KZN strain transmigrate the alveolar epithelial cell monolayer more efficiently than the MDR variant. The Beijing-XDR variant showed a high transmigration rate, while the susceptible variant showed no transmigration ability. Similar to the MDR F15/LAM4/KZN, the F28 and F11 strains showed a low dissemination ability. The bacteria were still capable to adhere to M059K glial cells after passage through the A549 cells. We conclude that M. tuberculosis isolates that passed through a monolayer of A549 alveolar epithelium by transcellular migration can still adhere to M059K glial cells. There is no genetic link between resistance and transmigration.","10.1007/s10096-021-04226-1

33833390,Increasing prevalence of resistance to second-line drugs among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in Kuwait.,Scientific reports,"Molecular methods detect genetic mutations associated with drug resistance. This study detected resistance-conferring mutations in gyrA/gyrB for fluoroquinolones and rrs/eis genes for second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs) among multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates in Kuwait. Fifty pansusceptible M. tuberculosis and 102 MDR-TB strains were tested. Phenotypic susceptibility testing was performed by MGIT 960 system using SIRE drug kit. GenoType MTBDRsl version 1 (gMTBDRslv1) and GenoType MTBDRsl version 2 (gMTBDRslv2) tests were used for mutation detection. Results were validated by PCR-sequencing of respective genes. Fingerprinting was performed by spoligotyping. No mutations were detected in pansusceptible isolates. gMTBDRslv1 detected gyrA mutations in 12 and rrs mutations in 8 MDR-TB isolates. gMTBDRsl2 additionally detected gyrB mutations in 2 and eis mutation in 1 isolate. Mutations in both gyrA/gyrB and rrs/eis were not detected. gMTBDRslv1 also detected ethambutol resistance-conferring embB mutations in 59 isolates. Although XDR-TB was not detected, frequency of resistance-conferring mutations for fluoroquinolones or SLIDs was significantly higher among isolates collected during 2013-2019 versus 2006-2012. Application of both tests is warranted for proper management of MDR-TB patients in Kuwait as gMTBDRslv2 detected resistance to fluoroquinolones and/or SLIDs in 3 additional isolates while gMTBDRslv1 additionally detected resistance to ethambutol in 58% of MDR-TB isolates.","10.1038/s41598-021-87516-0

Tuberculosis has been reported a serious complication in leukemia patients who undergo chemotherapy. The study was focused to find mutations in hupB gene of M. tuberculosis in 50 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients through semi multi complex PCR. A column based DNA isolation method was adopted for DNA isolation. The gene for histone-like protein (hupB [Rv2986c]) of M tuberculosis was amplified to detect two closely related mycobacterial species. Primers M and S (histone like protein HupB) were utilized to generate amplicons of 318 bp and 291 bp for M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, respectively. Out of fifty ALL patients, 21 (42%) were females and 29 (58%) were males. The prevalence of ALL was found higher in males as compared to females. The prevalence of ALL was higher in patients of age group 5-10 years. The results of the amplification showed that, the 318 bp fragment specific for M. tuberculosis was observed in seven samples (14%), while 291 bp fragment specific for M. bovis was not observed in any sample. Children with ALL were found at higher risk for tuberculosis.

33832459,"Molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis against levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, bedaquiline, linezolid, clofazimine, and delamanid in southwest of China.",BMC infectious diseases,"To explore the drug susceptibility of levofloxacin (LFX), moxifloxacin (MFX), bedaquiline (BDQ), linezolid (LZD), clofazimine (CFZ) and delamanid (DLM) against multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates from drug resistance survey of southwest China, and to illustrate the genetic characteristics of MDR-TB isolates with acquired drug resistance.
A total of 339 strains were collected from smear-positive TB patients in the drug resistance survey of southwest China between January 2014 and December 2016. The MICs for the above mentioned drugs were determined for MDR-TB by conventional drug susceptibility testing. Genes related to drug resistance were amplified with their corresponding pairs of primers.
MDR was observed in 88 (26.0%; 88/339) isolates. LFX had the highest resistance rate (50.0%; 44/88), followed by MFX (38.6%; 34/88). The resistance rate to LZD, CFZ, and DLM was 4.5% (4/88), 3.4% (3/88), and 4.5% (4/88), respectively, and the lowest resistance rate was observed in BDQ (2.3%; 2/88). Of the 45 isolates resistant to LFX and MFX, the most prevalent resistance mutation was found in gyrA with the substitution of codon 94 (34/45, 75.6%). Two strains with CFZ - BDQ cross resistance had a mutation in the Rv0678 gene. Of the four LZD resistant isolates, two carried mutations in rplC gene. For the four isolates resistant to DLM, one isolate had mutations in codon 318 of fbiC gene, and two isolates were with mutations in codon 81 of ddn gene.
This study provided evidence of the usefulness of new anti-TB drugs in the treatment of MDR-TB in China.","10.1186/s12879-021-06024-8

33835762,High-throughput sequencing identifies salivary microbiota in Chinese caries-free preschool children with primary dentition.,Journal of Zhejiang University. Science. B,"The study aimed at identifying salivary microbiota in caries-free Chinese preschool children using high-throughput sequencing.
Saliva samples were obtained from 35 caries-free preschool children (18 boys and 17 girls) with primary dentition, and 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the microorganisms were analyzed using Illumina MiSeq.
At 97% similarity level, all of these reads were clustered into 334 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Among these, five phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Candidate division TM7) and 13 genera (
Our results revealed the diversity and composition of salivary microbiota in caries-free preschool children, with little difference between male and female subjects. Identity of the core microbiome, coupled with prediction of gene function, deepens our understanding of oral microbiota in caries-free populations and provides basic information for associating salivary microecology and oral health.",10.1631/jzus.B2000554,"[{'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'The Affiliated Hospital of Stomatology, School of Stomatology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedical Research of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310006, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Zhifang', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'The Affiliated Hospital of Stomatology, School of Stomatology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedical Research of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310006, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'The Affiliated Hospital of Stomatology, School of Stomatology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedical Research of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310006, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Sa', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Affiliated Hospital of Stomatology, School of Stomatology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedical Research of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310006, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shu', 'firstname': 'Chang', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'The Affiliated Hospital of Stomatology, School of Stomatology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedical Research of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310006, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Duan', 'firstname': 'Zhuhui', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Stomatology, Luoyang Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Luoyang 471009, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Deng', 'firstname': 'Shuli', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Affiliated Hospital of Stomatology, School of Stomatology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, and Key Laboratory of Oral Biomedical Research of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 310006, China. dengshuli@zju.edu.cn.'}]"

PG is synthesized by class A/B penicillin-binding proteins (a/bPBPs) and shape, elongation, division, and sporulation (SEDS) proteins like RodA (as part of the Rod system cell elongation machinery) and degraded by ""autolytic"" enzymes to accommodate growth processes. It is thought that autolysins (particularly endopeptidases [EPs]) are required for PG synthesis and incorporation by creating gaps that are patched and paved by PG synthases, but the exact relationship between autolysins and PG synthesis remains incompletely understood.

33815376,CD169+ Subcapsular Macrophage Role in Antigen Adjuvant Activity.,Frontiers in immunology,"Vaccines have played a pivotal role in improving public health, however, many infectious diseases lack an effective vaccine. Controlling the spread of infectious diseases requires continuing studies to develop new and improved vaccines. Our laboratory has been investigating the immune enhancing mechanisms of Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand-based adjuvants, including the TLR2 ligand Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein, PorB. Adjuvant use of PorB increases costimulatory factors on antigen presenting cells (APC), increases antigen specific antibody production, and cytokine producing T cells. We have demonstrated that macrophage expression of MyD88 (required for TLR2 signaling) is an absolute requirement for the improved antibody response induced by PorB. Here-in, we specifically investigated the role of subcapsular CD169+ marginal zone macrophages in antibody production induced by the use of TLR-ligand based adjuvants (PorB and CpG) and non-TLR-ligand adjuvants (aluminum salts). CD169 knockout mice and mice treated with low dose clodronate treated animals (which only remove marginal zone macrophages), were used to investigate the role of these macrophages in adjuvant-dependent antibody production. In both sets of mice, total antigen specific immunoglobulins (IgGs) were diminished regardless of adjuvant used. However, the greatest reduction was seen with the use of TLR ligands as adjuvants. In addition, the effect of the absence of CD169+ macrophages on adjuvant induced antigen and antigen presenting cell trafficking to the lymph nodes was examined using immunofluorescence by determining the relative extent of antigen loading on dendritic cells (DCs) and antigen deposition on follicular dendritic cells (FDC). Interestingly, only vaccine preparations containing PorB had significant decreases in antigen deposition in lymphoid follicles and germinal centers in CD169 knockout mice or mice treated with low dose clodronate as compared to wildtype controls. Mice immunized with CpG containing preparations demonstrated decreased FDC networks in the mice treated with low dose clodronate. Conversely, alum containing preparations only demonstrated significant decreases in IgG in CD169 knockout mice. These studies stress that importance of subcapsular macrophages and their unique role in adjuvant-mediated antibody production, potentially due to an effect of these adjuvants on antigen trafficking to the lymph node and deposition on follicular dendritic cells.",10.3389/fimmu.2021.624197,"[{'lastname': 'Lisk', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuen', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuniholm', 'firstname': 'Jeff', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Antos', 'firstname': 'Danielle', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Reiser', 'firstname': 'Michael L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'DRK-Blutspendedienst, BaWü-Hessen gGmbH, Frankfurt, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wetzler', 'firstname': 'Lee M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States.\nDepartment of Microbiology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States.'}]"

The Tygerberg Endocarditis Cohort (TEC) study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of patients with confirmed or suspected IE presenting to Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Current analysis includes patients that presented between November 2019 and August 2020. Forty four (44) patients have been included in this ongoing study. Fourteen of the 44 patients (31.8%) had BCNE. Further analysis of the patients with BCNE identified Bartonella species as the most common causative organism (n=6; 43%). Other causes included Mycoplasma species (n=2). No cause could be identified in 4 of the 44 patients (9%). Bartonella quintana was identified with PCR of valvular tissue as the causative organism in 4 of the 5 patients that underwent urgent surgery. The patients with Bartonella IE (n=6) had an average age of 39 years with equal gender distribution. The common clinical features were clubbing (n=5; 83%), anemia (n=4; 66.6%), haematuria (n=3; 50%), acute on chronic severe regurgitant lesion (n=3; 50%) and acute severe regurgitant lesion (n=2; 33.3%).The aortic valve was involved in 5 of 6 patients. During a mean follow-up period of 251 days after diagnosis, no major adverse events occurred. Bartonella-associated IE is an important cause of BCNE in the Western Cape of South Africa. Imaging findings (in patients with BCNE) of significant valvular destruction with large vegetations on the aortic valve not affected by congenital or rheumatic valve disease should raise the suspicion of Bartonella-associated IE.","10.1007/s10096-021-04239-w

33811771,A clinical review and history of pubic lice.,Clinical and experimental dermatology,"The ectoparasite, Pthirus pubis (PtP), (crab or pubic louse) has plagued primates from pre-historic apes to Homo sapiens. We combed the literature from antiquity to present day using Medline and EMBASE, reviewing the pubic louse's origins, its evolution with mankind, presentation and management. Medline and EMBASE provided the greatest yield of literature compared to other databases. PtP incidence estimates range from 0.3-4.6% and prevalence around 2% in adults. War, disasters and overcrowding support lice transmission, but modern pubic hair grooming has reduced PtP in recent years. PtP, is usually found on pubic hair, but may infest scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes and body hair. Reports suggest the possibility of PtP as a vector for Bartonella spp. and Acinetobacter spp., requiring further studies. Transmission is via close contact, so sexual abuse and concomitant STIs should be considered. Symptoms and signs include: pruritus, red papules and rust/brown deposits from feeding or faecal matter. Visualisation of live lice confirms diagnosis. Long-standing treatments include hand-picking and combing, but in modern times pediculicidal products may generate faster resolution. Permethrin or pyrethrins are first-line recommendations. Resistance to pediculicides is common with head lice and is presumed likely in PtP although data are lacking. Pseudo-resistance occurs due to poor compliance, incorrect or ineffective dosing and reinfestation. In true resistance, a different pediculicide class should be used e.g., second-line agents: phenothrin, malathion or ivermectin. Lice have existed long before humans and given their adaptability, despite habitat challenges from fashion trends in body hair-removal, are likely to continue to survive.",10.1111/ced.14666,"[{'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'P U', 'initials': 'PU', 'affiliation': 'Norfolk and Norwich University Trust Hospital.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Genitourinary Medicine Department: iCASH Norwich, Cambridge community services NHS trust.'}, {'lastname': 'Levell', 'firstname': 'N J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': 'Norfolk and Norwich University Trust Hospital.'}]"

33829350,Bartonella species as a cause of culture-negative endocarditis in South Africa.,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,"Previous reports have highlighted the high prevalence of blood culture negative endocarditis (BCNE) in South Africa. The Tygerberg Endocarditis Cohort (TEC) study is an ongoing prospective cohort study of patients with confirmed or suspected IE presenting to Tygerberg Academic Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Current analysis includes patients that presented between November 2019 and August 2020. Forty four (44) patients have been included in this ongoing study. Fourteen of the 44 patients (31.8%) had BCNE. Further analysis of the patients with BCNE identified Bartonella species as the most common causative organism (n=6; 43%). Other causes included Mycoplasma species (n=2). No cause could be identified in 4 of the 44 patients (9%). Bartonella quintana was identified with PCR of valvular tissue as the causative organism in 4 of the 5 patients that underwent urgent surgery. The patients with Bartonella IE (n=6) had an average age of 39 years with equal gender distribution. The common clinical features were clubbing (n=5; 83%), anemia (n=4; 66.6%), haematuria (n=3; 50%), acute on chronic severe regurgitant lesion (n=3; 50%) and acute severe regurgitant lesion (n=2; 33.3%).The aortic valve was involved in 5 of 6 patients. During a mean follow-up period of 251 days after diagnosis, no major adverse events occurred. Bartonella-associated IE is an important cause of BCNE in the Western Cape of South Africa. Imaging findings (in patients with BCNE) of significant valvular destruction with large vegetations on the aortic valve not affected by congenital or rheumatic valve disease should raise the suspicion of Bartonella-associated IE.","10.1007/s10096-021-04239-w

33797675,Clinical profile and visual outcome of intraocular inflammation associated with cat-scratch disease in Japanese patients.,Japanese journal of ophthalmology,"To evaluate intraocular inflammation in Japanese patients with cat-scratch disease (CSD).
Retrospective clinical chart review.
The cases of 15 consecutive patients (19 affected eyes) in Kochi Prefecture, Japan who were serologically positive for Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana infection in association with intraocular inflammation were reviewed. The clinical manifestations, ocular complications, and treatment modalities were recorded. The clinical charts and photographic records were also reviewed for evidence of optic disc lesions, macular star, foci of chorioretinitis, and other findings.
Thirteen patients reported fever before or at the time of the initial presentation. Ten of 11 patients with decreased visual acuity manifested neuroretinitis, and the remaining patient showed retinochoroiditis with macular involvement. One patient with a visual field defect manifested branch retinal artery occlusion. Three patients without visual disturbance presented with fever of unknown cause. Discrete white retinal or retinochoroidal lesions were the most common findings (84% of eyes, 87% of patients), followed by retinal hemorrhage (63% of eyes, 80% of patients), optic disc lesions (63% of eyes, 73% of patients), serous retinal detachment (53% of eyes, 67% of patients), and macular star (47% of eyes, 60% of patients).
White retinal or retinochoroidal foci were the most common ocular posterior segment manifestations of CSD in this patient population. A diagnosis of CSD should be suspected in patients with fever and chorioretinal white spots, and the absence of neuroretinitis or macular star does not exclude the possibility of intraocular inflammation in CSD.","10.1007/s10384-021-00835-7

33609646,Human dental pulp stem cells: A sanctuary for relapsing Bartonella quintana.,Microbial pathogenesis,"Bartonella quintana is a facultative intracellular bacterium responsible for relapsing fever, an example of non-sterilizing immunity. The cellular sanctuary of B. quintana in-between febrile relapses remains unknown but repeated detection of B. quintana in dental pulp specimens suggested long-term half-life dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) as candidates. As the capacity of DPSCs to internalize microscopic particles was unknown, we confirmed that DPSCs internalized B. quintana bacteria: Gimenez staining and fluorescence microscopy localized B. quintana bacteria inside DPSCs and this internalization did not affect the cellular multiplication of DPSCs during a one-month follow-up despite the increase in the bacterial load. B. quintana-infected DPSCs did not produce Tumor Necrosis Factor-α whereas an important production of Monocytes Chemoattractant Protein-1 was observed. These unprecedented observations suggest the possibility that DPSCs are shelters for the long-term persistence of B. quintana in the host, warranting further experimental and clinical investigations.",10.1016/j.micpath.2021.104797,"[{'lastname': 'Oumarou Hama', 'firstname': 'Hamadou', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamada', 'firstname': 'Attoumani', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Aboudharam', 'firstname': 'Gérard', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; UFR Odontologie, Aix-Marseille-Université, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghigo', 'firstname': 'Éric', 'initials': 'É', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille Univ, IRD, AP-HM, SSA, VITROME, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Drancourt', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institut Hospitalier Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France; Aix-Marseille-Université, IRD, MEPHI, IHU Méditerranée Infection, Marseille, France.

33782445,Potential role of microbiome in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelits (CFS/ME).,Scientific reports,"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a severe multisystemic disease characterized by immunological abnormalities and dysfunction of energy metabolism. Recent evidences suggest strong correlations between dysbiosis and pathological condition. The present research explored the composition of the intestinal and oral microbiota in CFS/ME patients as compared to healthy controls. The fecal metabolomic profile of a subgroup of CFS/ME patients was also compared with the one of healthy controls. The fecal and salivary bacterial composition in CFS/ME patients was investigated by Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The metabolomic analysis was performed by an UHPLC-MS. The fecal microbiota of CFS/ME patients showed a reduction of Lachnospiraceae, particularly Anaerostipes, and an increased abundance of genera Bacteroides and Phascolarctobacterium compared to the non-CFS/ME groups. The oral microbiota of CFS/ME patients showed an increase of Rothia dentocariosa. The fecal metabolomic profile of CFS/ME patients revealed high levels of glutamic acid and argininosuccinic acid, together with a decrease of alpha-tocopherol. Our results reveal microbial signatures of dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota of CFS/ME patients. Further studies are needed to better understand if the microbial composition changes are cause or consequence of the onset of CFS/ME and if they are related to any of the several secondary symptoms.",10.1038/s41598-021-86425-6,"[{'lastname': 'Lupo', 'firstname': 'Giuseppe Francesco Damiano', 'initials': 'GFD', 'affiliation': 'Department for Sustainable Food Process-DiSTAS, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, 29122, Piacenza, Italy.\nLaboratory of Immunology and Genetic Analysis, Department of Earth and Environmental Science, University of Pavia, 27100, Pavia, Italy.\nCentre for Health Technologies, University of Pavia, 27100, Pavia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rocchetti', 'firstname': 'Gabriele', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department for Sustainable Food Process-DiSTAS, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, 29122, Piacenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Lucini', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department for Sustainable Food Process-DiSTAS, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, 29122, Piacenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Lorusso', 'firstname': 'Lorenzo', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'ASST Lecco, UOC Neurology and Stroke Unit, Merate, LC, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Manara', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'MAGI Euregio, Via Maso della Pieve, 60/A, 39100, Bolzano, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bertelli', 'firstname': 'Matteo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'MAGI Euregio, Via Maso della Pieve, 60/A, 39100, Bolzano, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Puglisi', 'firstname': 'Edoardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department for Sustainable Food Process-DiSTAS, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Via Emilia Parmense 84, 29122, Piacenza, Italy. edoardo.puglisi@unicatt.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Capelli', 'firstname': 'Enrica', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Immunology and Genetic Analysis, Department of Earth and Environmental Science, University of Pavia, 27100, Pavia, Italy. enrica.capelli@unipv.it.'}]"

In rare cases, Rothia aeria and Rothia dentocariosa can cause infective endocarditis (IE). The biofilm potential of Rothia in endocarditis is unknown.
Specimen from two cases of Rothia endocarditis were obtained during cardiac surgery. One of the patients suffered mitral valve IE from Rothia aeria. In the other case, IE of a prosthetic pulmonary valve was caused by Rothia dentocariosa. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for visualization of microorganisms within heart valve tissues in combination with PCR and sequencing (FISHseq).
The two heart valve specimens featured mature biofilms of bacteria that were identified by FISHseq as Rothia aeria and Rothia dentocariosa, respectively. FISH showed in situ biofilms of both microorganisms that feature distinct phenotypes for the first time ex vivo. Both of our reported cases were treated successfully by heart valve surgery and antibiotic therapy using beta-lactam antibiotics.
The biofilm potential of Rothia sp. must be taken into account. The awareness of Rothia aeria and Rothia dentocariosa as rare but relevant pathogens for infective endocarditis must be raised.

Eight potentially probiotic L. reuteri strains were evaluated for presence of mapA gene and its expression on co-culturing with the Caco-2 cells. The ability of untreated (Viable), heat-inactivated, 5 M LiCL treated L. reuteri strains as well as their cell-free supernatant (CFS) to modulate expression of IEB function genes (hBD-2, hBD-3, claudin-1 and occludin) was also evaluated. Caco-2 cells were treated with cell surface and extracellular protein extracts and investigated for change in expression of targeted IEB function genes. The results showed that mapA gene is present in all the tested L. reuteri strains and expression of mapA and its receptors (anxA13 and palm) increase significantly on co-culturing of L. reuteri and Caco-2 cells. Also, up-regulated expression of IEB function genes was observed on co-culturing of L. reuteri (viable, heat-inactivated and CFS) and their protein extracts with Caco-2 cells in contrast to down-regulation observed with the pathogenic strain of Salmonella typhi. Therefore, this study concludes that the cell surface and extracellular protein from L. reuteri act as an effective mediator molecules to regulate IEB function.","10.1007/s00203-021-02318-2

33824912,Engagement of ethics and regulatory authorities on human infection studies: Proceedings of an engagement workshop in Zambia.,Wellcome open research,"Human infection studies (HIS) have generally been used as a tool in the pathway for vaccine development in high income settings. Over the last decade, this model has been implemented in LMICs with the aim of accelerating development of next generation vaccines that would perform better in these settings. However, in most LMICs, the ethics and regulatory framework for the conduct of these studies are not in place. In Zambia, these studies are yet to be conducted and thus we conducted a stakeholder engagement workshop in October 2019. We engaged with bioethicists, regulatory authority, and scientists from within Zambia and other African countries to anticipate and address foreseeable ethical and regulatory issues when conducting HIS in Zambia for the first time. The workshop largely focused on sensitizing the stakeholders on the benefits of these studies with the following main points for consideration on the implementation of these studies in Zambia: need for in-country legal framework and guidelines; need for adequate informed consent based on comprehensive understanding of the concept of HIS and study requirements; and requirements for heightened vigilance to assure participant safety including good ethical and clinical practice with regulatory, ethical, data safety, and community oversight. Additionally, the workshop emphasized the need for rigorous health screening prior to enrolment; suitable infrastructure for containment; and personnel to provide appropriate treatment including emergency resuscitation and evacuation if indicated. Specific recommendations included compensation for burden of participation; access to care and provision for study related injury (e.g. no-fault insurance); and withdrawal and exit procedures to preserve individual and community safety. Finally, the meeting concluded that researchers should actively engage key gate keepers including civic leaders such as parliamentarians, universities, researchers, potential participants and laypersons to avoid circulation of misinformation.",10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16432.1,"[{'lastname': ""Kunda-Ng'andu"", 'firstname': 'Evelyn Muleba', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Simuyandi', 'firstname': 'Michelo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kapulu', 'firstname': 'Melissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Biosciences, KEMRI-Wellcome trust research Programme, Kilifi, Kenya.\nNuffield Department of Medicine, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Chirwa-Chobe', 'firstname': 'Masuzyo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mwanyungwi-Chinganya', 'firstname': 'Hope', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mwale', 'firstname': 'Stanley', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chilengi', 'firstname': 'Roma', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Anjali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, The centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia, 10101, Zambia.'}]"

One-day old 2400 chicks were randomly divided into eight groups; negative and positive control groups fed basal diet without additives and thymol and thymol nanoemulsion groups (0.25, 0.5 and 1% each). At d 23, all chicks except negative control were challenged with S. Typhimurium. Over the total growing period, birds fed 1% thymol nanoemulsion showed better growth performance even after S. Typhimurium challenge, which came parallel with upregulation of digestive enzyme genes (AMY2A, PNLIP and CCK). Additionally, higher levels of thymol nanoemulsion upregulated the expression of MUC-2, FABP2, IL-10, IgA and tight junction proteins genes and downregulated IL-2 and IL-6 genes expression. Moreover, 1% thymol nanoemulsion, and to lesser extent 0.5% thymol nanoemulsion and 1% thymol, corrected the histological alterations of cecum and liver postinfection. Finally, supplementation of 1% thymol, 0.5 and 1% thymol nanoemulsion led to increased Lactobacilli counts and decreased S. Typhimurium populations and downregulated invA gene expression postinfection. This first report of supplying thymol nanoemulsion in broiler diets proved that 1% nano-thymol is a potential growth promoting and antibacterial agent.","10.1038/s41598-021-86990-w

20112861,Development of an inhibitive enzyme assay for copper.,Journal of environmental biology,"In this work the development of an inhibitive assay for copper using the molybdenum-reducing enzyme assay is presented. The enzyme is assayed using 12-molybdophosphoric acid at pH 5.0 as an electron acceptor substrate and NADH as the electron donor substrate. The enzyme converts the yellowish solution into a deep blue solution. The assay is based on the ability of copper to inhibit the molybdenum-reducing enzyme from the molybdate-reducing Serratia sp. Strain DRY5. Other heavy metals tested did not inhibit the enzyme at 10 mg l(-1). The best model with high regression coefficient to measure copper inhibition is one-phase binding. The calculated IC50 (concentration causing 50% inhibition) is 0.099 mg l(-1) and the regression coefficient is 0.98. The comparative LC50, EC50 and IC50 data for copper in different toxicity tests show that the IC50 value for copper in this study is lower than those for immobilized urease, bromelain, Rainbow trout, R. meliloti, Baker's Yeast dehydrogenase activity Spirillum volutans, P. fluorescens, Aeromonas hydrophilia and synthetic activated sludge assays.

Cells were Gram-negative, large and highly motile due to bipolar tufts of flagella covered with mucous sheaths. Coccoid cells were sometimes formed. Strain D-427(T) grew optimally at pH 7.5-7.8 and 28 degrees C in the presence of 2 % O(2) in the gas phase. The organism showed oxidase and very low catalase activity. The isolate grew chemo-organotrophically with a limited number of organic acids as substrates. The DNA G+C content was 38.0 mol% (T(m)). Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed strain D-427(T) in the genus Spirillum within the class Betaproteobacteria. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain D-427(T) and Spirillum volutans ATCC 19554(T), the type strain of the single species of the genus, was 98.6 %. The low level of DNA-DNA hybridization and different phenotypic properties indicate that strain D-427(T) is clearly distinguishable from Spirillum volutans. No strain of S. volutans is available from any established culture collection or from the authors who described this species. Therefore, on the basis of phenotypic and genotypic data and the fact that the type and single species of the genus Spirillum cannot be included in any scientific study, since the type strain has been lost, we propose to assign strain D-427(T) as a novel species of the genus Spirillum, Spirillum winogradskyi sp. nov. (type strain D-427(T) =DSM 12756(T) =VKM B-2518(T)), and we request that the Judicial Commission place the name Spirillum volutans on the list of rejected names if a suitable type strain is not found or a neotype is not proposed within 2 years following the publication of this paper.

16758869,"[Two new species of microaerophilic sulfur spirilla, Spirillum winogradskii sp. nov. and Spirillum kriegii sp. nov].",Mikrobiologiia,"New microaerophilic sulfur-oxidizing spirilla were isolated from hydrogen sulfide sludge of wastewater treatment plants. Strains D-427 and D-430 have spiral cells that are highly motile due to bipolar flagellum bundles covered with mucous sheaths. Under a phase-contrast microscope, these bundles are visible as single polar flagella. Spheroplasts are formed in the stationary growth phase. Both strains are obligate organotrophs able to oxidize a number of reduced sulfur compounds. The oxidation of sulfide and polysulfide leads to the formation of intracellular globules of elemental sulfur; thiosulfate oxidation results in tetrathionate accumulation in the medium. The cells are unable to utilize reduced sulfur compounds in the energy metabolism; their oxidation is caused by a chemical interaction with H2O2 and O2, synthesized in the electron transport chain. Both strains are obligate microaerophiles with an optimal oxygen concentration in the gas phase of 2 and 0.8% for strains D-427 and D-430, respectively. The strains utilize a limited number of organic acids as growth substrates, mainly tricarboxylic-acid-cycle intermediates. The DNA G+C content is 38.0 mol % (T(m)) for strain D-427 and 38.9 mol % for strain D-430. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences, revealed that the new isolates of sulfur spirilla are the most closely related to Spirillum volutans, the type species of the genus (97.4% similarity).

Objectives of this study were to use standardized acute toxicity tests to assess treatment of petrochemical industry effluents and the toxicity of various treated industrial effluents in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area and their receiving waters. Tests for the first objective used Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia; those for the second used D. magna, Spirillum volutans, and Scenedesmus spinosus. Chemical analyses demonstrated that the removal of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, styrene, and naphthalene) from the petrochemical effluents ranged between 77 and 93%, but toxicity removal was significantly lower: untreated effluents were very toxic and treated effluents were very toxic to toxic [acute toxicity units (TUa) > 3]. Physicochemical parameters measured according to current Argentinian regulations indicated that industrial effluents (e.g., from textile and paper industries) were within established guidelines, but 25% of the samples were moderately to highly toxic (TUa > 1.33). However, for the receiving waters, toxicity tests were moderate to very toxic.

33836411,Metabolomic analysis of antimicrobial mechanism of polysaccharides from Sparassis crispa based on HPLC-Q-TOF/MS.,Carbohydrate research,"Abuse of antibiotics makes antibiotic-resistance become a huge challenge in bacterial infection treatment. The discovery of new antibiotics is of great significance to human health. In this study, the antibacterial mechanism of Sparassis crispa polysaccharides (SCPs) was explored. The SCPs isolated from Sparassis crispa was composed of fucose, glucose and galactose with a molar ratio of 0.043 : 0.652: 0.305. Bacteriostatic tests showed SCPs inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus better than Escherichia coli's, and damage to bacteria was observed under scanning electron microscopy. Metabolomic analysis based on HPLC-Q-TOF/MS indicated that SCPs disrupted metabolism of the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways in S. aureus. The variations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate, 1,3-diphosphoglycerol, succinate and oxaloacetate were significant, whose systematic changes accompanied with decrease of ATP in cells indicated that SCPs could exert antibacterial effects by inducing dysfunction of catabolism and energy metabolism.

33836278,Photodynamic Therapy for Treating Staphylococcus aureus Infections.,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,"Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive spherical bacterium that causes various infections that can be superficial or become life-threatening. Besides, S. aureus represents a major producer of healthcare-associated infections. Hospital strains of S. aureus are exceptionally resistant to antibiotics, which has made their treatment difficult in recent decades. Other therapeutic alternatives have been postulated to overcome the drawbacks of multi-resistance. Of these, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising approach to address the notable shortage of new active antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. PDT combines the use of a photosensitizer agent, light, and oxygen to eradicate pathogenic microorganisms. Through a systematic analysis of published results, this work aims to verify the usefulness of applying PDT in treating multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
This review was based on a bibliographic search in various databases and the analysis of relevant publications.
There is currently a large body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of photodynamic therapy in eliminating Staphylococcus aureus strains. Both biofilm-producing strains, as well as multidrug-resistant strains.
We conclude that there is sufficient scientific evidence that PDT is a safe and useful adjunct to traditional antibiotic therapy for treating S. aureus infections.

This study aimed to explore the anti-biofilm efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) using nano-emodin (N-EMO) against multi-species bacterial biofilms containing Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii.
Following synthesis and confirmation of N-EMO as a sonosensitizer, the anti-biofilm efficacy of SDT against multi-species bacterial biofilms was determined using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC), and minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of N-EMO. The reduction of multi-species bacterial biofilms was then evaluated following the treatments using Log reduction and crystal violet (CV) assays. In addition, the expression profiling of abaI, agrA, and lasI genes using SDT with sub-MIC, sub-MBIC, and sub-MBEC of N-EMO was assessed.
Successful synthesis of N-EMO was confirmed through several characterization tests. As the results demonstrated, the MIC value of N-EMO for the multi-species bacterial suspension was 0.15 × 10

33836129,Bronchiectasis among Australian Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients in the regional and remote population of the Northern Territory of Australia.,Rural and remote health,"Chronic respiratory disorders are highly prevalent among Australian Aboriginal people living in the Top End Health Service region in the Northern Territory, Australia. Bronchiectasis is a heterogenous disease that features among these chronic respiratory conditions in this population. However, there are sparse comparative data between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis from this region.
In this retrospective study, demographics, clinical characteristics and relevant laboratory parameters were compared among adult Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis between 2012 and 2017.
A total of 388 adults had radiology-confirmed bronchiectasis and 258 (66%) were Aboriginal. Compared to non-Aboriginal patients, Aboriginal patients were significantly younger (mean age 54 v 67 years), the majority lived in rural and remote communities (80% v 9 %), had higher rates of self-reported smoking (52% v 19%), alcohol consumption (29% v 12%) and co-occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (65% v 38%) and other chronic co-morbidities. Sputum microbiology was also different between the groups with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis being more common in Aboriginal patients, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus species and non-tuberculous mycobacteria were higher in non-Aboriginal patients. Further, Aboriginal patients had poorer lung function compared to non-Aboriginal patients (forced expiratory volume after 1 second predicted 33% v 53%, forced vital capacity predicted 49% v 60% respectively), higher exacerbation rates (29% v 18%) and poorer overall outcomes (age at death 60 v 76 years).
Within a single health service, Aboriginal patients with bronchiectasis have significantly poorer outcomes with differing manifestations and higher comorbidities than non-Aboriginal patients. This warrants further studies to identify feasible interventions to reduce this inequity.",10.22605/RRH6390,"[{'lastname': 'Mehra', 'firstname': 'Sumit', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; and Department of Pulmonary Physiology and Sleep Medicine, Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia dr.sumitmehra1@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Anne B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': ""Child Health Division, Menzies School of Health Research, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Queensland Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; and Center of Children's Health Research, Australian Centre For Health Services Innovation, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia anne.chang@menzies.edu.au.""}, {'lastname': 'Lam', 'firstname': 'Chor K', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; and College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia lammaree@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'Stuart', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; Department of General Medicine, Gold Coast University Hospital, Southport, Queensland, Australia; and School of Medicine, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia stuartc345@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Mingi', 'firstname': 'Joy J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Charles Darwin University, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; and Darwin Respiratory and Sleep Health, Darwin Private Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia joyjjose@yahoo.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Izaak', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia izaakh.thomas@nt.gov.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Harwood', 'firstname': 'Suzanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia suzanne.harwood@malala.com.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Maguire', 'firstname': 'Graeme', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Melbourne Medical School, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia graeme.maguire@wh.org.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Heraganahally', 'firstname': 'Subash', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Darwin Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia; College of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; and Darwin Respiratory and Sleep Health, Darwin Private Hospital, Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia hssubhashcmc@hotmail.com.'}]"

The purpose of media has evolved from simple isolation to more measured study.

33831049,The impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into the paediatric immunisation programme in Iceland-A population-based time series analysis.,PloS one,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a cause of infections that range in severity from acute otitis media (AOM) to pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV10) was introduced into the Icelandic paediatric immunisation programme in 2011. The aim was to estimate the population impact and cost-effectiveness of PHiD-CV10 introduction.
Data on primary care visits from 2005-2015 and hospitalisations from 2005-2017 were obtained from population-based registries. A Bayesian time series analysis with synthetic controls was employed to estimate the number of cases of AOM, pneumonia and IPD that would have occurred between 2013-2017, had PHiD-CV10 not been introduced. Prevented cases were calculated by subtracting the observed number of cases from this estimate. The cost of the programme was calculated accounting for cost-savings due to prevented cases.
The introduction of PHiD-CV10 prevented 13,767 (95% credible interval [CI] 2,511-29,410) visits for AOM from 2013-2015, and prevented 1,814 (95%CI -523-4,512) hospitalisations for pneumonia and 53 (95%CI -17-177) admissions for IPD from 2013-2017. Visits for AOM decreased both among young children and among children 4-19 years of age, with rate ratios between 0.72-0.89. Decreases were observed in both pneumonia hospitalisations (rate ratios between 0.67-0.92) and IPD (rate ratios between 0.27-0.94). The total cost of implementing PHiD-CV10 in Iceland was -7,463,176 United States Dollars (USD) (95%CI -16,159,551-582,135) with 2.1 USD (95%CI 0.2-4.7) saved for every 1 USD spent.
The introduction of PHiD-CV10 was associated with large decreases in visits and hospitalisations for infections commonly caused by pneumococcus and was cost-saving during the first five years of the immunisation programme.",10.1371/journal.pone.0249497,"[{'lastname': 'Eythorsson', 'firstname': 'Elias', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ásgeirsdóttir', 'firstname': 'Tinna L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Economics, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Erlendsdóttir', 'firstname': 'Helga', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.\nDepartment of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali-The National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hrafnkelsson', 'firstname': 'Birgir', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mathematics, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kristinsson', 'firstname': 'Karl G', 'initials': 'KG', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.\nDepartment of Clinical Microbiology, Landspitali-The National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.'}, {'lastname': 'Haraldsson', 'firstname': 'Ásgeir', 'initials': 'Á', 'affiliation': ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.\nChildren's Hospital Iceland, Landspitali-The National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.""}]"
